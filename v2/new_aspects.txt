processors	hyperthreading---------------------------------------------------

cores technologies laptop
however often laptop processors will have more logical cores than physical cores due to hyperthreading or other technologies

the rule of thumb is that if a cpu is given more than double the count of actively running threads as it has execution units these are the physical cores on a cpu chip and logical processors like hyperthreading technology that splits one core into two then the os will spend more time scheduling threads and switching between them cache-thrashing than it will spend actually running the threads

a quad core intel cpu s with hyperthreading enabled has 4 physical cores yet 8 logical processors hyperthreading creates 4 more logical processors


modern older law
first amdahl s law is older than hyperthreading so the law itself assumes you have physical processors

more modern processors handle hyperthreading better than older processors


subtraction	addition---------------------------------------------------

simpler method computers
you will have a more difficult tostring method but your addition and subtraction will be simpler

knuth writes that fibonacci search is preferable on some computers because it involves only addition and subtraction not division by 2. but almost all computers use binary arithmetic in which division by 2 is simpler than addition and subtraction


functions iteration decrement
of course the relative overhead will be smaller for functions that do more work than one addition and one subtraction per iteration

i managed to write increment and decrement functions but the addition and subtraction seem even less documented and harder to write


multiplication division operations
the operations are always algebraically simple never involving anything more than addition multiplication subtraction division and taking powers

it is also possible to manipulate the inputs so that various parts of the calculation return 0 for addition or subtraction or 1 for multiplication or division to make testing easier but this only gets me so far

i don t know how it works but it s much more complex than addition subtraction or even multiplication

apart from that multiplication is addition done more than once and division is subtraction done more than once

multiplication is more expensive than addition subtraction and division is more expensive still

for floating point operations addition and subtraction are harder than multiplication and division so they may be slower or not again it depends on how much transistor real estate there is dedicated to the fpu

the addition and subtraction are much more than multiplication and division

the term is apparently not an exact measurement as it is clear that a double-precision floating-point operation is going to take longer than a single-precision one and multiplication and division are going to take longer than addition and subtraction

i found it fairly easy to generate addition subtraction and multiplication questions at random however division is more tricky

the intuition would say addition subtraction are faster than multiplication division but is that really correct

in general you ll have more variation with multiplication and division than with addition and subtraction


number range issue
it will be much slower i don t have benchmarks but i would guess at least an order of magnitude maybe more decimal will not benefit from any hardware acceleration and arithmetic on it will require relatively expensive multiplication division by powers of 10 which is far more expensive than multiplication and dividion by powers of 2 to match the exponent before addition subtraction and to bring the exponent back into range after multiplication division

if the exponent are more different than the size of the mantissa then addition or subtraction you get the number with the larger exponent as the result all the bits of the smaller number have shifted off into the bit bucket n + 0 n - 0

i was thinking that there could be an issue if the result from the addition is bigger than what 15 bits can represent 32767 or if i get a negative number in the subtraction


precedence higher lower
according to python.org unary + and unary - operators have greater precedence over addition and subtraction

multiplication division and modulo have the same precedence and they all have higher precedence than addition and subtraction

multiplication and division operators have higher precedence than addition and subtraction in c++ same as in scientific notation

and have lower precedence than addition and subtraction so it messes up your expressions

bit shifts have lower precedence than addition subtraction see in docs

addition subtraction assignment has lower procedure than simply add operation

division has a higher precedence than addition or subtraction so it s really this

i don t think they have a natural precedence unlike say multiplication and division being of greater precedence than subtraction and addition because they can be built from subtraction and addition

by the way the result of this addition taking its lower 8 bits discarding the carry bit is the result of the original subtraction

multiplication has higher precedence than addition subtraction

in fact has precedence even lower than addition and subtraction so x y+z comes out wrong--it means x y+z instead of the x y +z that you d want

multiplication and division have higher priority than addition and subtraction

to start with i need multiplication and division to take higher precedence than addition and subtraction

addition and subtraction are slightly lower latency multiplication is the same

finally we all know that multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction so we can remove the extraneous parentheses so this turns into

and keep in mind that the modulo has a higher precedence than addition and subtraction

either way your example with the numeric expression would multiplying by 3 first because multiplication has higher precedence than addition or subtraction

i know the basics division and multiplication higher than addition and subtraction but i would have to look up something more esoteric

multiplication and division have a higher precedence than addition and subtraction

division multiplication has higher precedence than addition subtraction and parentheses is required to do addition subtraction before multiplication division

the only way it would be broken up differently would be if addition had a higher precedence than subtraction like multiplication does

nothing follows the rule of multiplication and division having more precedence over addition and subtraction

put each token +- of final command string in a list maybe a binary tree works and sort that list to tell the calculator that division and multiplication has the highest priority in the mean time addition and subtraction has lower priority

then you ll notice that the dereference operator has higher priority than addition subtraction + - operators they are in group no

this is happening because the concatenation operator has a higher precedence than the addition or subtraction operators but multiplication and division have a higher precedence then concatenation

and my question is this if the book says that the addition and subtraction have lower priority compared to other operators what if i add the value of a typical expression multiplied


better careful sse
if you want to support better than just addition and subtraction you could do it as an eval if you are careful about how data gets into #number

a111 addition is equal or better than subtraction

i know that addition and subtraction perform better when using sse


slower faster operations
division is performed by repeated subtraction therefore needs more level of subtract logic making division slower than addition

here it is conceivable that subtraction is slower than addition

but i d think bignum subtraction is a little slower than bignum addition

to be a randomaccessiterator it must support these operations plus a few more such as addition and subtraction

it s possible though that software could mess things up by making subtraction slower than addition - but that s unlikely

they are slower less efficient than addition subtraction but they are much faster than looping and doing repeated additions

re-order your script so the subtraction test is timed first then the addition and suddenly addition becomes the faster operation again

i m curious about why bitwise operations were slightly faster than addition subtraction operations on older microprocessors

typically operations like addition and subtraction are much faster in integer -- multiplication and division less so

i don t understand why the division multiplication in c++ is so much slower than addition subtraction where the managed c# version is more reasonable to my expectations

this is a hold over from older compilers and interpreters on old chip architecture that would do addition slightly slower than subtraction

since addition can be faster then subtraction we add the offset instead of subtract it from 31

if one of the numbers is a constant your compiler might optimize by doing some combination of bit shifts and subtractions mostly for powers of two since hardware div mod is slower than addition or subtraction but on modern processors the latency already only a few nanoseconds is hidden by tons of other performance tricks so you needn t worry about it

integer multiplication division and modulo are much slower than integer addition and subtraction

not that these are bad granted they tend to be an order of magnitude slower than addition subtraction negation etc. but they aren t needed and if they re present it probably means the implementation isn t really that efficient


codeigniter	kohana---------------------------------------------------

great internal base
in kohana for example also codeigniter but kohana is more flexible you can build internal requests with

overall kohana is more flexible than codeigniter and a great base to build a web application and api on


bitwise-and	modulo---------------------------------------------------

wildfly	glassfish---------------------------------------------------

mergesort	heapsort---------------------------------------------------

reason assumption slower
heapsort tends to be slower than mergesort for the same reason.

2-3 times faster than mergesort or heapsort

typically mergesort is slower than heapsort and quicksort but that s usually under the assumption that comparisons are fast

for 5 000 000 ints still stored in memory quicksort becomes suddenly worse then heapsort and mergesort

worst case for quicksort is actually worse than heapsort and mergesort but quicksort is faster on average

normally quicksort is faster than mergesort which is faster than heapsort


mri	rubinius---------------------------------------------------

efficiency choices global
for longer-running applications like a web application rubinius or jruby will generally perform better than mri

works on some rubies better than others jruby and rubinius are recommended efficiency on mri is decreased due to gvl global vm lock

in practice this means that deploying a rails app to jruby is a good idea as is running your integration tests but for developer unit tests and scripts mri yarv or rubinius are better choices


verilog	vhdl---------------------------------------------------

modeling novel fortran
do i wish vhdl and verilog took more from functional languages

in certain respects systemc deliberately mimics the hardware description languages vhdl and verilog but is more aptly described as a system-level modeling language

in the same way that english is a better language to write a novel than fortran vhdl and verilog are better languages to describe logic circuits than c


avro	thrift---------------------------------------------------

solutions worth better
if there is lot of data exchange then a binary format like protobuf or thrift or avro is better

also it is worth mentioning that besides thrift protobuf and avro there are some more solutions on the market such as capt n proto or bolt


kde	gnome---------------------------------------------------

tools smaller choices
here s a list of lots of choices basically anything that s not kde or gnome will be smaller

i am trying to explore kde a bit but many of the tools i rely on have fonts that appear so much bigger under kde than gnome even though the chosen font size is the same and the resolution is the same 1920x1200

the motivation is that font size 12 under kde seems to be much larger than under gnome


screens	mdpi---------------------------------------------------

48x48 high 72x72
if you re diligent about making graphics for at least the main three densities ldpi mdpi and hdpi then you should not see over-large icons except where the screens is physically smaller than your layout expects it

if the screens density is less than xhdpi i load smaller sampled sizes of the 96x96 image - as 36x36 for ldpi 48x48 for mdpi 72x72 for hdpi

try placing youre images in res mdpi they will be streched to fit screens which are bigger hdpi xhdpi

do note that a 120x120px image if displayed on the screens will be 3x smaller on a xxhdpi device compared to a mdpi device as there are three times as many pixels per inch

ldpi assets will look bad on high density screens but are exponentially smaller than mdpi which is exponentially smaller than hdpi etc

i have used this link to generate nine-patch images however even if i add the files to the drawable ldpi mdpi ldpi xhdpi and xxhdpi folders the image is still shorter than the screens width

a hdpi image on a ldpi screens would appear larger than the same image on a mdpi or hdpi screens

a ldpi image on a hdpi screens would appear smaller than the same image on a mdpi or ldpi screens

if in java code the values would be in pixels so 50px on mdpi screens will look larger than on hdpi screens

i read in some tutorials that android automatically scales up the images when the screens resolution is bigger than mdpi

so these circles on a xhdpi screens will be visually smaller than on an mdpi screens where pixels are bigger

proportionally the hdpi screens is slightly taller than the mdpi screens

so as i said - mdpi also doesn t means that your screens resolution is less than hdpi screens resolution

even if i create three versions for ldpi mdpi and hdpi there are more than screens resolutions in that table if there is no matching image it will scale my image and may not retain the aspect ratio

addressing issue #2 if your mdpi phone has a smaller screens than 600dp it will use the layout in res layout folder


iboutlet	ibaction---------------------------------------------------

metadata special nothing
ibaction and iboutlet are nothing more than metadata that tells the interface builder that this is a possible connection

iboutlet and ibaction are nothing more than special pre-processor directives that tell xcode that you can wire these things up via interface builder


ienumerable	ilist---------------------------------------------------

abstract collections method
ienumerable is more abstract and is generally preferred to list or ilist if possible

another suggestion change you to because you can keep an extension method for more collections because the ienumerable is more abstract than ilist


specific functions
ienumerable is less specific than an ilist that is ilist has functions that ienumerable does not

ienumerable is less specific than ilist

an ienumerable is less specific than an ilist


functionality nhibernate thing
another thing that bothers me is why in nhibernate always it is being used ilist and not ienumerable which has less functionality

you need to use tolist to convert it from ienumerable because the ilist interface supports more functionality than the ienumerable interface


concave	angle---------------------------------------------------

polygon corner shape
if the total of the angle is less than 180â the triangle must be â œhyperbolicâ on a concave surface which might be the shape of our universe

you check that the polygon is not concave by simply checking for all angle being less than 180 degrees - any corners which has a angle of over 180 is concave and you need to break it at that corner


rubygems	rvm---------------------------------------------------

newer latest simpler
something else simpler you could try is to force rvm to reinstall the older version of rubygems and then update it again if required

you could now use rvm to uninstall the older versions of rubygems in your system and only keept the latest ruby version

if you need it for a production system rvm is already seen as mature enough to maintain rubygems updated with newer versions


jboss	glassfish---------------------------------------------------

specifications production shiro
spring security is fine too but if you plan to use jsf 2 you probably also use cdi provided by seam weld which is integrated into the java ee 6 profile from glassfish and jboss it is easier to use shiro as spring heavily relies on its own dependency injection methods although spring security does not need that much injected classes but you should stick to one way of doing things

scaleing the underlying application server tomcat glassfish jboss ... seems nicer but currently i only found redhats openshift for doing this

afaik jboss is much more adopted in production deployments than glassfish but this doesn t necessarily mean it s better

they are lightweight because they implement only a few of the specifications at the heart of which is servlet and jsp the larger enterprise level applications jboss glassfish etc implement much more specifications on the server side

from that point the servlet file actually the web server tomcat glassfish jboss etc is behaving more or less like the iis and aspx file

but if you want a full-fledged java ee 6 server then glassfish 3 or jboss 6 is a better alternative

i think glassfish is a better j2ee app server to start with than jboss


interpolation	splines---------------------------------------------------

trapezodial cubic fit
whether splines or linear trapezodial interpolation is a better fit will depend heavily on your problem

with a lower order splines that works better but then you lose the advantage of cubic interpolation


ng-show	ng-hide---------------------------------------------------

ux directive options
using ng-hide and ng-show is better then doing it manually maybe something like this for the directive template

they have a good edit in-line model and it seems to have better ux than the ng-hide ng-show options


cloudant	couchdb---------------------------------------------------

pdfbox	itext---------------------------------------------------

lodash	underscore.js---------------------------------------------------

functional libraries cleaner
but really feel this can be done much cleaner with underscore.js or lodash functional programming

my early impression seems to be that it is an attempt to extend and improve on libraries such as underscore.js and lodash while sticking more strictly to a purely functional style


easier es5 array
this is easier with lodash underscore.js or even with es5 array and object methods but since you asked about pure js

if you have access to lodash or underscore.js it is even easier with pluck


latest features easiest
the easiest solution is to just replace underscore.js with lodash which has even more features than the latest underscore.js

because lodash is updated more frequently than underscore.js a lodash underscore.js build is provided to ensure compatibility with the latest stable version of underscore.js


faster non-native use
if i remember correctly lodash argued they were faster than underscore.js because the use non-native functions for key operations

you can also use underscore.js but lodash is faster more complete and you can create custom build with only what you need

lodash is definitely not slower than underscore.js


better performance blog
edit as pointed out in the comment lodash is likely to be a better solution than underscore.js

keep in mind that i am using lodash by john-david dalton instead of underscore.js because lodash provides better performance and a custom build process

then when you extract the keys of each object you can compare using _.isequal function by provided by lodash instead of underscore.js usually lodash has better performance

i believe lodash is a better choice over underscore.js more details in this blog post

this is apparently no accident if these are left out of underscore.js lodash composability is better than features

note previously this answer recommended underscore.js but lodash has done a better job of getting bugs fixed and addressing issues with consistency

if you re open to using lodash which is a better version of underscore.js imo this can be expressed fairly simply using flattendeep on each element of your multi-dimensional array

i can help you with lodash which is a superset of underscore.js and much better than underscore.js when it comes to performance and consistency see lodash vs underscore.js


native faster browsers
the solution from charliefl is approximately 100x faster than underscore.js depending on browser in this case and lodash being up to 2x faster than underscore.js

i am stunned right now seeing a lodash performing 100-150 faster than underscore.js in even simple native functions such as array.every in chrome

in general and underscore.js are slower native bind is fast on some browsers slow on v8 and lodash can distinguish between the two


rank	max---------------------------------------------------

query table time
if no rank is lower than its number there are no gaps in the table the query returns the max number + 1

every time a rank finds a larger number than that stored have it send its new max to the root rank


udp	mtu---------------------------------------------------

byte ethernet faster
i read in a case where a stream of 300 byte packets was being sent over ethernet 1500 byte mtu and tcp was 50 faster than udp

for example i read an experiment in which a stream of 300 byte packets was being sent over ethernet 1500 byte mtu and tcp was 50 faster than udp


size packets smaller
if you send a udp datagram larger than the mtu it will be fragmented

my another question is if i put the data size smaller than mtu into sendto then i can guarantee call sendto once socket only sends one tcp udp packet

udp uses datagrams chunks of data which are received whole on the other side unless the size is bigger than the mtu but that s a different story

in real life udp packets size usually is equal or less than mtu size

note that udp packets bigger than the mtu s at every hope between your hosts will be split by ip

basically while sending udp packets larger than mtu ip fragmentation can occur if it s supported on your platform but not all platforms support it

when send a udp datagram larger than the mtu size only the last fragment of the udp datagram is putted out to the destination

if there is network congestion rate limiting or traffic profiling or if the udp message size is larger than the mtu

ever since i did sockets programming on a pdp 11 it s been the case that ip fragmentation will take care of the case where an ip datagram such as a udp datagram is larger than the mtu for the segment allows

udp packets smaller than the mtu will not be fragmented but the mtu depends on more factors such as ip options and vlan headers so it may not be greater than 1500

when udp data size is smaller 1452 than ppp mtu no error

ideally your udp frames are smaller than the mtu for your architecture say 1500 bytes so the messages won t get chopped up in transit

3 you are sending messages that are bigger than the udp max message size 4 each device in your network has a max message size mtu so you might be exceeding a limit there

my another question is if i put the data size smaller than mtu into sendto then i can gurantee call sendto once socket only sends one tcp udp packet

in addition to the suppositions in question 4 supposing that my message is no bigger than the mtu - udp header - ip header size is the udp datagram that results guaranteed to fit into 1 ip packet on my local network at least

if udp payload size is bigger than mtu size udp will silently segment the packet

udp packets greater than the mtu size of the network that carries them will be automatically split up into multiple packets and then reassembled by the recipient

my lwip can send udp packets to pc but my pc would fail to reassemble when the udp packets are larger than mtu


package larger bigger
what would happen if my udp package is larger than mtu

they are easily generated for udp simply by making the datagram bigger than the mtu


scheme	racket---------------------------------------------------

side functionality closer
do racket macros have more advanced functionality than those found in scheme or common lisp

racket is closer to scheme than to common lisp but you could dip your toes into the lisp family without the speed bump of the emacs style of development

on the side of using macros racket has always been more advanced than other scheme and lisp implementations


rspec	minitest---------------------------------------------------

better global unit
minitest or rspec is more or less global to your test suite in that all of your specs will be written using that same framework

you can write a simple test script to verify this but using test unit rspec or minitest is even better


uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller---------------------------------------------------

ant	pom.xml---------------------------------------------------

range	max---------------------------------------------------

z2 value2 valid
i have this grid each coordinate in the grid can be either closed or open i m tying to using an open coordinate find all the open coordinates around the first that are valid and the walk range between then is equal or lower than the max walk range

if max z1 z2 range is less than or equal to table2 max value2 where table1.type table2.type


range data unique
if you want to check that a number is between the min and max of the range you would likely want to check that it is both higher than the min and lower than the max

and during sometime i have a range where min and max is less than 1 and greater than 0

i would like to know if there is a way to access the range of said shader properties so that i can set a max and min value to my sliders

it may look odd but it is common for number-to-string functions in many programming languages to make an exception for the min value in this way because with two s complement representation of integers the max value is 1 less than the absolute of the min value range of -2 147 483 648 to +2 147 483 647 which means the min value is the only negative value you can t flip to positive and then process using the same shared loop code as for the positive values.

if range is greater then or less then the min and max then it should throw error

consider using long type as your number is greater than integer max range 2 147 483 647

however i m getting a attributeerror max must be larger than min in range parameter. error when i m trying to plot the normalized data

i want to validate a number as decimal up to two decimal and minimum range is greater than 0.00 and max range is up to 99.99

the problem is it is overflowing therefore it works fine when the result returned is in int_max range 10 9 but negative value is show in case of value returned from function is greater than int max range

produces the same error attributeerror max must be larger than min in range parameter

in general you want to have a range slightly larger than x max - x min and then divide the range into the desired number of bins

the question i have is i would like the calendar to only display the min and max date range for the from date and to date any thing greater than the max and anything less than the min should be greyed out

an automatically adjusted range will always be the next power of 10 greater than max value

your value 6131231234 is greater than int max value 6131231234 is not accommodated into int range which results into exception

to create equal bins you can simply first define a min and max value which is slightly smaller than both range

2 that the min range is not greater or equal to the max range.

but with this the last range is larger than the max value

avoiding variables and functions cross join the table against some other table s to generate a range of rows where the range is greater than the max value of quantity

a larger range means a greater max value and a smaller min value than decimal

i am trying to create a figure in which the colorbar will extend beyond the data range go higher than the max value of data

the max value of a range must be greater than or equal to the min

but continuing i always got attributeerror max must be larger than min in range parameter

ie the range includes min but excludes max and values greater than max or less than min wrap around in a circle

it works like range so i need to pass it a number one greater than the max number in the current index

keep in mind that the cast int d will not throw an exception if the value of d is outside the range of an int - if which is greater than the max value of an int the resultant cast will be -2147483648

retrieve the unique range whose max value is greater than an ip

therefore if you are trying to create a byte out of an int and it is larger than the max range of the byte it will divide by the max value of byte and give you the remainder as the byte s value


mxmlc	compc---------------------------------------------------

compilers faster
compilers but it compiles faster than the mxmlc and compc

it works similarly to mxmlc and compc but compiles faster


drawimage	putimagedata---------------------------------------------------

getimagedata manipulation use
don t use getimagedata putimagedata for clipping since drawimage is easier and faster.

if you don t intend to do pixel manipulation you should only use drawimage without getimagedata putimagedata which are slower though


faster function slower
using drawimage canvas is much faster than using putimagedata

as of right now drawimage is much faster than putimagedata

i have seen that the drawimage function is really faster than the putimagedata

right now putimagedata is much slower than drawimage as you can see here

drawimage seems to be much faster than putimagedata


earlier old year
that beeing said putimagedata is much slower than drawimage at least when i tested them earlier this year

the only problem that as far as i know using drawimage is slower than using putimagedata and it was required in old browser versions like firefox 2 or such


return-value-optimization	nrvo---------------------------------------------------

urllib	httplib---------------------------------------------------

better powerful abstract
urllib and urllib2 are build upon httplib they are more abstract and powerful but sometimes won t fulfill your specified need about some http related operations

requests is one of the cleanest api s i ve ever seen way better than httplib + urllib + urllib2


d3.js	leaflet---------------------------------------------------

freebsd	netbsd---------------------------------------------------

direct3d	direct2d---------------------------------------------------

xslt	xquery---------------------------------------------------

appropriate kind processing
xquery or xslt are much more suited to this kind of thing

this kind of processing is most easily done with xslt which is more expressive than xquery

xslt or xquery would be more appropriate tools fix errors found in the xml

xslt is significantly more appropriate to use than xquery for such kind of tasks

generally working at the c# level is appropriate if your application is 10 xml processing and 90 other things while xslt xquery are more appropriate if it s 90 xml manipulation and 10 other things


nicer better
nowadays with xquery there is no reason to use xslt anymore xquery is much nicer

using xslt or xquery would be much better


template analysis amenable
xquery is more amenable to static analysis than xslt because it lacks the very dynamic template despatch mechanism

xquery works better than xslt for this because it s more amenable to static analysis as it lacks the polymorphism of xslt s template rules


class convenient xml
saxon-ee supports streaming of large xml documents using xslt or xquery streaming is better supported in xslt than in xquery

if structural change is part of your agenda i think you should seriously consider not using jaxb technologies like xquery and xslt are much better suited to this scenario

i hate to answer a request for a solution in language a by suggesting a solution in language b but what you are doing here falls into the class of problems which xslt handles much better than xquery

i think xquery would be more convenient if you had all of your xml in a database but on the filesystem xslt may be simpler

what you try to achieve is certainly possible with xquery or with xslt which is more convenient for transforming xml trees especially for multiple transform passes

as for whether to use xslt or xquery the proof is in the pudding xslt is better at transforms and xquery is better at queries

as dimitre says xslt is much better at this class of problem than xquery


stdout	stderr---------------------------------------------------

life perspective hood
the under the hood of stdout and stderr can be easier to visualize in the c c++ perspective

note that capturing stdout and stderr combined is actually easier

you can also use processbuilder to redirect the stderr through the stdout to make life easier using processbuilder#redirecterrorstream boolean


closelog better errors
sometimes this way is a better than stdout stderr but you have to use openlog closelog

stderr is better than stdout for errors for a couple of reasons


runtimeexception	unchecked-exception---------------------------------------------------

behat	mink---------------------------------------------------

vbscript	jscript---------------------------------------------------

small powerful segment
the inclusion of jscript code into a batch file is simpler than vbscript and the translation of a small code segment from vbs to jscript is not problematic

...i suggest doing all of the scripting from within the vbscript file and avoiding the use of .cmd .bat files completely if you can as vbscript is much more readable and powerful though i prefer using the jscript language instead but that s just me


cufft	fftw---------------------------------------------------

batched experiments fft
however for a variety of fft problem sizes i ve found that cufft is slower than fftw with openmp

in the experiments and discussion below i find that cufft is slower than fftw for batched 2d ffts


org.json	jackson---------------------------------------------------

nashorn gson better
org.json jackson and gson with gson being 10x slower

in this case jackson performs better than nashorn which performs much better than org.json

or switch from org.json to something that performs better such as gson or jackson


apache-poi	docx4j---------------------------------------------------

tcpdf	fpdf---------------------------------------------------

past look better
i suggest you to give a look to tcpdf which is far better than fpdf also because it is actively developed

i ve used tcpdf in the past and found it a lot better than fpdf


strdup	malloc---------------------------------------------------

memory free things
in c memory most other things are managed by the programmer so strdup is no worse than forgetting to free malloc ed memory failing to null terminate a string using incorrect format string in scanf and invoking undefined behaviour accessing dangling pointer etc

you should know that strdup allocates more memory and returns its pointer which you then overwrite the original pointer returned by malloc so it will be impossible to free that memory since you no longer have the pointers


identical convenient call
because of the above replace strdup with strlen malloc memcpy memcpy is slightly faster than strcpy

additionally if you have strdup then it is much more convenient than strlen + malloc + strcpy with identical result including the same obligation to free the allocated storage when you no longer need it

you can use either to create a new memory block which is separate from the original but naturally strdup is simpler since it doesn t require a separate malloc strlen call


willing cleaner responsibility
as i noted in comments however if you re willing to rely on posix s strdup then that s cleaner than strlen + malloc + and has the same semantics you take responsibility for freeing the memory allocated for the copy

or indeed if your system has strdup or you re willing to write an implementation then strdup is much cleaner than malloc + strcpy


coffeescript	livescript---------------------------------------------------

appealing feature compatible
livescript is coco but much more compatible with coffeescript more functional and more feature rich

livescript derived from coco which itself was derived from coffeescript it has the more appealing syntax to me it even has my beloved pipeline | operator from f#


cpu	processors---------------------------------------------------

resources system multithreaded
the difference you notice is very small but i think the multi-thread processors is spending more time because the concurrency for the cpu resources between the threads

as soon as you go beyond single processors it s much more effective to add another cpu or two to system than to struggle with gpu calculations

the operating system will give your program all the resources it needs the reason your process is not consuming all the cpu is probably because it s waiting for the io sub system more than the processors

on a system with more than one processors or processors cores you can normally assuming you do have a smp-enabled system cpu affinity doesn t prevent it expect those two processes to use both processors but you do not strictly have a guarantee

parallel processing is by far a more strict mode of execution of the code-units tasks threads... than just a concurrent run of code-execution simultaneously just by coincidence using more than one cpu or processors core and other shared resources to execute a program or multiple but mutually absolutely independent computational units

with current hardware at about twice the number of active threads as execution units cores ht logical processors however the architecture handles multithreaded execution your cpu starts spending more time scheduling thread execution and managing thread states than it is actually executing the threaded instructions


core computer intel
processors intel core i5-4440 cpu 3.10ghz that s to mention if speed matters

in general when used on single processors single core machine this should be sufficient assuming int size same or smaller than cpu word like 32bit int on 32bit cpu

multicore refers to a computer or processors that has more than one logical cpu core and that can execute multiple instructions at the same time.

windows 7 home premium service pack 1 processors intel core i5-2410m cpu 2.30 ghz 2.30ghz

processors intel core i5-2500k cpu 3.30ghz sandy bridge processorcount 4

for complicated reasons having to do with the internal electronics of the cpu for most modern processors it is faster to perform a direct branch where the destination address is encoded in the instruction than an indirect branch where the address is computed at runtime

processors intel core i3-4005u cpu 1.70ghz 1.70ghz

the cpu is indeed slower on sparc 1.2ghz and as answered by one of the sun s engineers t2 is usualy 3 times slower for single-threaded application than modern intel processors

processors intel core i5-5300u cpu 2.30ghz 2.30ghz

a quad core intel cpu s with hyperthreading enabled has 4 physical cores yet 8 logical processors hyperthreading creates 4 more logical processors

the rule of thumb is that if a cpu is given more than double the count of actively running threads as it has execution units these are the physical cores on a cpu chip and logical processors like hyperthreading technology that splits one core into two then the os will spend more time scheduling threads and switching between them cache-thrashing than it will spend actually running the threads

processors intel core i5-4440 cpu 3.10ghz x 4

multicore means that a single cpu can have more than one core capable of executing tasks and has all execution units connected in some way depending on the architecture of the processors

the simultaneous use of more than one cpu or processors core to programmatically execute a program or multiple computational threads

i have read that the number of threads cannot be more than the number of logical processors your computer has or at least there is no advantage to be gained since your cpu cannot handle more

the intel amd processors are much cheaper and faster than what you can get with these until they go in every cpu everywhere

processors intel core i7-4790 cpu 3.60ghz x 8

processors intel core i7-4770hq cpu 2.20ghz haswell processorcount 2

processors intel core i7-3930k cpu 3.20ghz

a concurrent run of a code-execution happens simultaneously just by coincidence using more than one cpu or processors core and other shared resources to execute a program or multiple but mutually independent computational units tasks threads et al

i have read a superscalar cpu architecture implements a form of parallelism called instruction level parallelism within a single processors superscalar cant use more than one processors

should i just look for more than one cpu core and how do i detect that or maybe the processors speed or total system memory

i have a quad core processors and the threadpoolexecutor is set to 4 core threads but when i submit my callables hundred or so to the threadpoolexecutor java never uses more than 25 cpu

since these are typically orders of magnitude slower than the processors from the cpu s perspective this takes forever

multicore refers to a computer or processors that has more than one logical cpu core and that can physically execute multiple instructions at the same time

processors intel core i3-2120 cpu 3.30ghz 4 cpus

processors intel core i7-6700hq cpu 2.60ghz


data memory ram
the point of this cache is to store data that the cpu is using quite regularly to speed up transfer time since the cpu cache is physically closer to the processors then ram is

having data structures that start on 4 byte word alignment on cpus with 4 byte buses and processors is far more efficient when moving data around memory and between ram and the cpu

this is because some compilers or processors will use more bits of precision in a cpu register than in memory msvc has 3 different floating-point behavior options for example


different cores functions
since downloading web pages is network bound rather than cpu bound using more threads than my number of processors cores is very benificial since most of the time in each thread is spent waiting for the network to catch up

given that you re seeing extra tasks causing a slowdown you likely either have resource contention via locking or your tasks are cpu bound and having more tasks than processors cores will cause slowdowns

binding threads to cores prevents the operating system from moving around threads between different processors cores which speeds up the executing especially on numa systems machines with more than one cpu sockets and separate memory controller in each socket where data locality is very important

real mode seem to be different from cpu to cpu maybe latest processors provide more functions to this mode

the application has far fewer threads than the cpu has processors cores

if that processors has more than one cpu can the interrupts run on different cpu cores at the same time


frequency lower debugger
rise cpu frequency set more powerful processors s

may be the debugger is slowing down the processors cpu running in lower frequency compared to free run and you are getting the interrupts properly


pascal	delphi---------------------------------------------------

free	calloc---------------------------------------------------

notice function memory
secondly i notice that when i run my program i m seeing the free function call more often than the malloc calloc calls 98 to 16

malloc free is harder because thereâ s also calloc and realloc

how does free know how much memory to be free d which was earlier allocated by malloc or calloc


accessor	ivar---------------------------------------------------

significant situations runtime
the accessor will be faster since you ll avoid all the slogging through the runtime to find the ivar in question

technically accessing the ivar directly is faster than using accessor but there are very few situations in which it will make a significant performance difference and would probably be a case of premature optimization


namedtuple	dictionary---------------------------------------------------

variables faster per-instance
namedtuple is faster and significantly more memory efficient than a dictionary

namedtuple instances are just as memory efficient as regular tuples as they do not have per-instance dictionary making them faster than dictionary

but it seems like using a namedtuple would be even better since they are more memory efficient than dictionary and your variables suggest you can use a fixed set of fields


lists idea use
namedtuple should perform better less overhead than dictionary if the lists are long

using a dictionary or a namedtuple would be a better idea because then you wouldn t have to remember what each element in a tuple corresponds to does score come first or does id

depending on your use case a dictionary might fit better than a namedtuple


free	malloc---------------------------------------------------

functions well-defined family
to release it even though what it actually does is little more than malloc and free but by having you call these functions they provide a well-defined and clear api which assumes responsibility for knowing such things

further you are passing pointers to free which are no more returned by malloc family functions


faster slower safer
the overheads are typically smaller than malloc free in c or new dispose in c++

why new delete is slower than malloc free

it is also non-standard unsafe and non-portable basically worse than using malloc and free in c++

i ve seen mention that it is two orders of magnitude slower than host malloc and free

using malloc free directly is safer

speed-wise the above seem to be at least an order of magnitude slower than glibc malloc free on my machine

avoids n calls to malloc free it s faster and simpler to allocate deallocate

finding a package that can work with both new delete and malloc free obviously gives you more flexibility

malloc free would be faster on this case

i have written a memory allocator that is supposedly faster than using malloc free

the justification of realloc is that it s faster than 2nd malloc manual copy free

will malloc free be slower than allocating a big chuck at the begining of the program and running my own memory manager over it

will malloc free be slower than allocating a big chunk at the beginning of the program and running my own memory manager over it

a realloc can occur significantly faster than a malloc memcpy and free

new delete operator are usually invokes constructors destructors and they are a little bit slower than malloc free

in this case using malloc and free is likely easier though to help with compatibility you may want to define them as new and delete

the c++-way is more readable in my opinion and new and delete are safer than malloc and free

as you suspect a normal free and malloc would be faster but that s because they do less

malloc free is harder because thereâ s also calloc and realloc

it s 4 times faster than using malloc free and copying your data when scaling up

if the constructors and destructors are empty like for built-ins new and delete shouldn t be slower than malloc and free are

yes that may since your allocating with new but deallocating with delelte yes malloc free is safer here but in c++ you should not use them since they won t handle de constructors

malloc is much easier to implement if there is no free


use costs better
use of malloc free is even more rare and should be used very sparingly

i feel the need to mention that java s good garbage collection in general is better than malloc free of c

but conversely malloc free typically makes better use of memory than a modern copying gc .

a malloc free pair can be better than a realloc if you don t need to keep around the original memory

remember malloc is quite expensive action and free costs even much more than malloc

but apparently tracing garbage collection is so good that it is better than using malloc free

in the case of overflow a free malloc pair costs less than realloc because of its internal hidden memcpy


operations store context
in this context free store is different and incompatible with heap because the new delete free store library is simpler and quicker than the malloc free realloc calloc heap library and thus provides huge memory usage gains to the c++ embedded programmer in a context where you have only 512 bytes of ram

you know -- operations such as new or malloc actually consume more memory than they allocate -- the system uses their own tree structures to keep track of where memory is free and where it is not

if you want better guarantees about zeroing or to get free zeroing on smaller allocations though it s more wasteful the closer to one page you get you can just explicitly do what malloc calloc do implicitly and use the os provided zero-ed memory replace

the term heap may also refer to a particular data structure but in the context of the c++ malloc free new and delete operations the terms heap and free store are used more or less interchangeably


memory pointer realloc
one interesting experiment you can try is to try and malloc more memory after you free d that pointer

you could have some initial guess for maxsize 8 and grow when needed your data perhaps by using realloc or just by malloc -ing a bigger new chunk copying the older chunk inside then free -ing that older chunk

suppose char p malloc n assigns more than n say n bytes of memory are allocated and free p is used to free the memory allocated to p

garbage-collection may be slower than malloc and free for programs that allocate at once all the memory they need and work with that

now if you free some values on the heap and allocate more with malloc you may be given back some of that dirtied memory that you scribbed on earlier

secondly i notice that when i run my program i m seeing the free function call more often than the malloc calloc calls 98 to 16

generally new delete and malloc realloc free arrange for more memory from the os using sbrk or os-specific-equivalent and divide the pages up however they like to satisfy the program s allocation requests

passing 0 to malloc either returns null or special pointer which can be used to call free it is better to make it initialize simply with null or better an empty string with a 0 character

how does free know how much memory to be free d which was earlier allocated by malloc or calloc

i m not saying that realloc is worse than implementing realloc using a malloc free

that s why realloc can temporarily require more memory than a malloc free pair

you should know that strdup allocates more memory and returns its pointer which you then overwrite the original pointer returned by malloc so it will be impossible to free that memory since you no longer have the pointers

in c memory most other things are managed by the programmer so strdup is no worse than forgetting to free malloc ed memory failing to null terminate a string using incorrect format string in scanf and invoking undefined behaviour accessing dangling pointer etc

if you work with data that doesn t need construction destruction and requires reallocations a large array of ints then i believe malloc free is a good choice as it gives you realloc which is way faster than new-memcpy-delete it is on my linux box but i guess this may be platform dependent

in c you would use malloc to get memory realloc to get more memory and free to release memory

malloc finds 10 more free bytes and marks them as used

dynamic memory management on an small embedded system is tricky to begin with but realloc is no more complicated than a free and malloc of course that s not what it does

allocating more memory with malloc does not prevent the memory error if the free call inside the dosomething method is incommented


number gdb fread
i have the line and line number from running gdb but i need to know if malloc and free have been called more than once to confirm that there is indeed at least one case where it runs smoothly

as long as malloc can allocate it you can fill it up with fread although fread is free to read a smaller number of elements


geocoding	geocode---------------------------------------------------

uiview	subviews---------------------------------------------------

uicollectionview apple layer
for my circular viewgroup i just want to put each basic view uibutton uiimageview ... around center of my circular viewgroup i read the apple doc about uiview and uicollectionview and both can contains zero or more subviews and i don t know what i should use uiview seems less difficult than uicollectionview but uicollectionview seems more appropriate for what i want to do maybe i am wrong but how implement customcollectionlayout and how set this layout in customuicollectionview because i planed to add in future custom drawing and animation

of course uiscrollview can have more than one content view just as any uiview can have more than one subviews and this case it will be more difficult to render its layer


class 4px bigger
i have a label with a single character that i wish to be bigger than the uiview that it s a subviews of

because the uiview is smaller it is going to crop out the larger subviews

i want to add a uiview of smaller frame as subviews to parental view but i am not getting the needed

they re much bigger than the uiview of which they are subviews

the uiview is taller than the screen so in ib i pulled it out of the scroll view so i could see it all but i never moved it back to being a subviews of the scroll view

i have a smaller uiview as a subviews to the main uiview on my uiviewcontroller

when using embed in - uiview the new view will be a bit bigger than the subviews

i have 2 more uiview as subviews in scrollcontainer view

do i just create a new uiview that is 4px larger than the selected object and and make the selected view a subviews of it

you could put a smaller uiview as subviews of your selectionview and change tha background color of that view

i have a uiview class hierarchy that has self.layer.shouldrasterize turned on in order to improve scrolling performance all of them have static subviews that are larger than the screen of the device

add smaller webview as a subviews to the uiview


notepad++	sublimetext---------------------------------------------------

equals	gethashcode---------------------------------------------------

faster unique equivalent
even though gethashcode itself should be fast it s not mostly faster than equivalent equals

gethashcode should be a lot quicker than equals but doesn t need to be unique

so gethashcode should be much faster than actually running equals

if you do not implement gethashcode union will call equals which will work but is slower than gethashcode


better generic meaning
but i guess as you want to be generic implementing equals and gethashcode would be a better option

overriding equals and gethashcode gives it better meaning


dotnetzip	sharpziplib---------------------------------------------------

division	subtract---------------------------------------------------

decimal	ieee---------------------------------------------------

base binary32 floating-point
the maximum representable value with ieee 754-2008 binary32 is so the base 2 log of a number stored in binary 32 is less than decimal 128

the third line displays the data with the maximum useful precision - an ieee 754 64bit floating-point number has slightly less than 16 decimal digits of precision so all those digits of the literal in math.h are pointless perhaps they can be seen as future-proofing against a possible future redefinition in a format with more precision


tablet	galaxy---------------------------------------------------

asus iphone note
tablet have larger displays but the pixel density is not as high as on for example the iphone 4 samsung galaxy nexus etc

so for example a galaxy note 1 calling a gs3 experiences more delay than a galaxy note 1 calling nexus 7 tablet asus and galaxy note 1 calling a xiaomi mi-2 phone


g++	gcc---------------------------------------------------

popular open-source linux
i d expect gcc g++ is more popular on open-source oses

some people argue gcc g++ is more popular on linux while icc is more popular on windows


better
g++ seems to work better than gcc in my experience

so using g++ is better than gcc


version limited differences
the g++ version is a little larger than the gcc version but not 100x larger

i m always having to tune the code for gcc g++ differences - usually the given version of g++ is just more limited in what it allows


compiler codes slower
g++ compiler is more strict then gcc compiler

or maybe that is one of the reasons why visual studio gives slower codes than gcc g++ compiler


treemap	linkedhashmap---------------------------------------------------

arraylist slower test
after a few test hashmap linkedhashmap and treemap are way slower than arraylist and i wanted to use them just for the ability to create submaps

you would like reading this post too as whenever you start comparing you might understand better difference between hashmap linkedhashmap and treemap


for-loop	while-loop---------------------------------------------------

cleaner faster
edit just realized a while-loop may well be a lot cleaner than a for-loop for this

and now we know that for-loop is faster than while-loop

i have also found that a while-loop is faster than a for-loop


theano	tensorflow---------------------------------------------------

wider respects faster
it theano runs much faster than tensorflow

theano is still faster than tensorflow in many respects and supports a wider range of operations


virtualenv	conda---------------------------------------------------

packages bonus additional
if you are using anaconda conda is a better alternative to virtualenv as it manages conda packages which are not limited to just python packages

an additional bonus i find that conda works better as a package manager than virtualenv


bazaar	svn---------------------------------------------------

touchesbegan	touchesmoved---------------------------------------------------

typedef	struct---------------------------------------------------

life foo name-lookup
i changed the bitmap header file a little to typedef the struct and make life easier at least for me

struct foo is easier to parse then typedef d foo as the name-lookup is simpler


factors	mean---------------------------------------------------

allocations growth smaller
if your growth factors is larger than the golden mean that can t happen

if the factors is smaller than the golden mean 1.6 and the previous allocations are contiguous with each other they ll eventually add up to a chunk that can satisfy a later requirement

if the factors is larger than the golden mean they never will


plot	heatmap---------------------------------------------------

margin	height---------------------------------------------------

lower suitable available
this may be ommited once height is lower than available - thus negative margin may work

if the list items were of a fixed height i could add margin to put it lower down but because each item of the list can vary in height this won t be suitable


images someone nicer
edit someone else suggested css and i believe that using the height and width directives from css will give you the same result as using the same attributes of the tag but doesn t limit you strictly to images and a will play nicer with any margin or padding directives you might use

should i just target each images and count the container height and use the remainer as top margin or is there easier solution


width padding smaller
when i put an h2 tag into this form area ie reports that the box is taller than the height i assigned by the height and margin padding i gave to the h2 tag

how to calculate element s width and height with their padding margin values using less code

basically if it can scale to 100 height of the parent container margin padding included without the width becoming bigger than the parent container s let it scale up

they appear to scale on the width ok but grow in height leaving more margin between the text and the border

so increasing height padding margin or hiding showing earlier elements on the page will affect and push down elements defined later

gives a way to make the margin transparent but they are still there and the plot is smaller than height and width i set in the saved file

for width i can use margin 0 auto but height is trickier because it would need to make a div absolute

what i want it to do is to center a given image from a database into a div for example if the given images width is bigger than height it echos it with a left margin

when i add a margin to the divs the width becomes smaller and the height stays the same so the aspect ratio changes


fixed window elastic
or if you want to keep margin on parent but you don t want height to be more then window height you could use calc 100vh - marginofchildren like this demo

i removed fixed height from .subgroup and decreased margin to make div more elastic

also you cannot rely on fixed 300px margin i.e if window height is less than 500px you re already missing 100px


top greater equal
your wrapper has a height of 100 of the body which also has a height of 100 but it also has a top margin making the total outer height greater than the height of the window

the first row has a height that is much larger than the margin bottom of its .content div so that the margin-bottom is contained and should not effect anything outside of its container

margin should be less than or equal to coin image height and also give some left margin to fill effects

it seems that that top margin gets added to the 100 height making it higher and causing the scrollbar

if you want to use it then add a bottom margin to the content_main which should be equal or greater than the height of the ad layout

in activity_main.xml below the feedbackview has a margin top of -36dp which is greater than its height when non-negated

but then the java script adds some margin to top and bottom when the image height is smaller

since my top content for the homepage is a fixed height through javascript i tried simply changing the top margin to the difference between the window height and that fixed value when window height is greater than the fixed value

i have this code for when an image loads in our app and then when the height is greater than the width add a class to bump up the margin

you also need to set a height that is greater than the negative top margin so part of the element will be visible so the user can hover over it

your listview item s height is looking bigger because your are applying 17dp padding and 4dp margin at the top and 7dp padding and 4dp margin at the bottom of the textview ...so its taking total 32dp extra space excluding your textview

you will need to set android layout_paddingtop on the relativelayout equal or greater than the height of the repeat password field + any top margin it might have

in conjunction with a negative margin equal to or greater than the height of the top and bottom borders if any to further remove the element

if i apply a negative margin to it that is greater than its height the first time feedbackview.showtext is called it doesn t animate in correctly

you basically need to make sure that either the content has a bottom margin greater than or equal to the height of the footer or if the content is in a container of some sort that it s container has a bottom padding equal to or greater than the height of the footer

if the height is greater than 66px i want to apply a negative top margin equal to half of its height

if the element height is greater than the window height minus the nav bar height then additional margin is added to the bottom of my element so that what was hidden behind the bottom nav bar is now revealed on scroll

you ll need to set the top margin for whatever item you want under it to be greater than the height of your navbar in order for it to show up correctly

the width and height you provided should be greater than amount of padding for example summing top and bottom margin 18 + 18 36px so height should be greater than 36px same goes for height

it is treating the floated ul as position absolute but only when its height is less than or equal to the negative top margin on its containing parent

i assume margintop can t be solved since im setting margin top to -820 in order to get at a point of top 275 therefore screens smaller than 1200px height the div will go much higher...

the value of margin top will be equal or greater than height of the fixed header height

#footer s height is more than 800px so the #container should lose its top margin value by touching #footer and continue scrolling the page without that floating div


larger bellow cell
setting the datatemplate s grid s width and height to be larger than the cell with a negative margin can produce a close result but if you resize the column the problem shows itself again

sometimes when enough content items is added this div height is larger than windows and part of div content is not visible at all it stays bellow page margin


greater iframe image
the margin will be greater than the height of the iframe

therefore assuming the container s width is greater than the image s height margin -50 0 should be enough


qhash	qmap---------------------------------------------------

lookups wirelessapdata values
qhash provides faster lookups than qmap

also i have changed the qmap to qhash to make it faster and wirelessapdata is just a struct

qhash is faster but qmap values are sorted by key if you iterate through them


equals	compareto---------------------------------------------------

argument numbers sooner
you need to call the compareto method which will indicate the result of the comparison by returning an integer less than greater than or equals to 0

or is it compareto returns negative numbers 0 and positive numbers respectively indicating whether the calling object is less than equals to or greater than the specified object

if compareto returns a negative int it means less than 0 means equals 1 means greater than

is a generic type at compile time java will require that an instance provide an implementation of int compareto t o which from the javadoc returns a negative integer zero or a positive integer as this object is less than equals to or greater than the specified object

implement compareto in temporary temporary.compareto left such that it returns a negative integer zero or a positive integer as temporary is less than equals to or greater than the left

per the page i linked to compareto returns a negative integer zero or a positive integer as this object is less than equals to or greater than the specified object.

compareto returns a negative integer zero or a positive integer as this object is less than equals to or greater than the specified object

compareto return a negative integer zero or a positive integer as this object is less than equals to or greater than the specified object

i know that in java there is a compareto method that you can write in a class that will compare two variables and return a value -1 1 or 0 signifing greater than less than and equals to operations

with this rather than needing to implement a comparator all you need to implement is the int compareto class o method in the class which returns a negative integer zero or a positive integer as this object is less than equals to or greater than the specified object.

in the compareto method you can decide which fields are used for the comparison greater less than or equals

the compareto method returns one of -1 0 1 depending on whether or not the argument is less than equals to or greater than respectively

icomparable declares the compareto method which returns an integer that specifies a less than equals to or greater than relationship between two objects of the same type

i am using the compareto method in java to try and check if a certain date is greater than or equals than 24 hours after another date

it s not clear to me what you want but i ll mention that the date class also has a compareto method which can be used to determine with one call if two date objects are equals or if they aren t equals which occurs sooner

in the compareto method you can then write the code which will call the getters for the year month and so on until it figures out whether the current object is less than equals to or greater than the object o being passed into the compareto method

this interface defines the method compareto t which will return a negative number zero or a positive number if the first object is less than equals to or greater than the other one respectively

the interface defines one method compareto that must return a negative integer zero or a positive integer if this object is less than equals to or greater than the other object respectively

according to javadoc compareto needs to return a negative integer zero or a positive integer as this object is less than equals to or greater than the specified object

the compareto method returns 1 0 or -1 depending on whether value a is respectively greater than equals to or lesser than value b

the only significance of a compareto return value is if it is greater less than or equals to zero

we can call its compareto method to decide whether it is bigger than equals to or less than any int

compareto compares values and returns an int which tells if the values compare less than equals or greater than

compareto method returns a negative integer zero or a positive integer as this object is less than equals to or greater than the specified object

you should be using compareto method for less than or equals or greater than

note that in both cases you can take advantage of the fact that int also implements so you can use its compareto method to determine whether corresponding values in each instance of your class are less than equals to or greater than each other


serializable	deserialization---------------------------------------------------

faster object bigger
when it comes to serializable deserialization i find it easier to convert to from a generic representation of your object that the serializable could recognize and interpret it as needed

the question is a bit wider than serializable deserialization and applies to any situation where some object could be uniquely rebuild from jpa persistent data and vice versa

also test and measure serializable deserialization may be slower than the normal methods of object creation - note that you d probably be deserializing twice from session to string then string into object of that class

deserialization is harder than serializable

the serializable seems quicker but deserialization much slower and the app is doing more deserializing than serializing

in my mind serializable deserialization should be faster than parsing and reinitializing a wavefront model however my benchmark shows otherwise

have you considered creating an object structure for these files and serializing them java object serializable and deserialization is much faster than parsing an xml this is again considering that these 500 or so xml files don t get modified between reads

note that while serializable is now optimized deserialization is doubly slower because i deserialize to object to then reserialize to string

it also caused a bigger problem with serializable and deserialization

serializable deserialization becomes a bigger bottleneck when you scale out to a session server or use sql server to manage session state

much faster than serializable deserialization though

if the taskproperty class is decorated with datacontract attribute and with datamember attribute for each property the deserialization is much faster than when it is decorated with serializable attribute

i m trying to figure out how to better deal with json serializable deserialization of nested java objects in spring mvc

the micro-benchmark included ensures that this solution is not slower than default serializable deserialization

if the orb implements local object optimization sometimes collocated objects then it will not open any sockets but it will perform serializable deserialization which is typically faster than marshalling

that kinda makes sense since session state mode in production was sqlserver and serializable deserialization was apparently slower than just assigning values to properties from a datareader

the transmission size is bigger using datacontractserializer but during serializable and deserialization it is faster to use datacontractserializer

java object serializable deserialization is not faster than xml writing and parsing in general

i don t have any experience with serializable but i was expecting deserialization to be faster than normal processing at least for the cpickle module

3 if i have a large object to cache i find serializable and deserialization takes a longer time in ignite and retrieving from distributed cache is slow


better constructor solution
i would like to find better solution than serializable and deserialization

this question is not to discuss if using copy constructor is better than serializable deserialization or not


control process javascriptconverter
you ll need to implement serializable to have java handle the serializable or externalizable if you need more control over the deserialization process

you can use the javascriptconverter class when you need more control over the serializable and deserialization process

use json.net it allows for far greater control over serializable and deserialization

you don t need to write any new members - it s just a marker interface - but there are other methods you can add to give more control over serializable and deserialization

you can also use javascriptconverter when you need more control over the serializable and deserialization process

serializable and deserialization process runs slower


pyenv	virtualenv---------------------------------------------------

apache	nginx---------------------------------------------------

example comfortable configurations
letâ s encrypt provides great scripts for apache 2 and nginx but not lighttpd which is much more comfortable for small systems like raspberry pi or old boxes

just one tip if only job for the http server will be just proxying the play apps consider using some lighter option than apache for an example nginx or lighttpd you ll find sample configurations for all of them in play s documentation


better web setup
if this is what you re really trying to do rather than a simplified example you may be able to accomplish the same thing with apache mod_rewrite or the equivalent in nginx and have better performance since you re not executing any php code at that point

hi everyone i need help with this i ve already set up nginx + php and it works great faster than apache my problem is how to setup a multiple projects in one ip

i ve heard it suggested that i use nginx as a reverse proxy in front of apache and node.js is that a better solution than just nginx

i m currently using apache as web server but i have heard that nginx can handle more requests with more concurrency than that of apache because of the non-blocking nature of the system

apache mod_wsgi will actually benefit from this as well if everything is setup properly as nginx will isolate apache from slow http clients allowing apache to perform better with fewer resources

i have configured tomcat with apache web server in past and never slowness problem before and practically speaking nginx is said to much lighter and faster than apache web server

i know apache reverse proxy and nginx are better for this but i need to make db request from validatetoken method and to my knowledge it is not possible with apache or nginx

it may even use a different server software say nginx or lighttpd that has less overhead than the traditional apache setup

i have no idea what i m doing so i dove nose-first into nginx -- which i had never used before -- because someone told me it s better than apache at dealing with lots of small tasks and requests -- not that i would know how to turn apache into a proxy mind you

note that in any case for increased security and fast static file css js delivery you might want to add a reverse proxy layer nginx usually provides better performance but apache works as well before the nodejs python server

tornadoweb and nginx are popular web servers for the moment and many benchmarkings show that they have a better performance than apache under certain circumstances

is nginx + php-fpm is suppose to do server operations much faster than apache + mod-php due to efficient usage of memory and other resources

nginx is faster and lighter but many people find it easier to work with apache because of .htaccess support nginx does not have an analog due to performance concern

although this thread is more than a year old it still merits from the fact that no one mentioned about the not so recent innovations of nginx lighty and other web servers which scale much better than apache at higher concurrency and consume lesser resources


faster static files
how can nginx performs better than apache

nginx is still faster and i might choose it but apache isn t asleep

for example nginx is much faster than apache

you can create custom controller to serve that files and use send_file mentod in it with disposition inline also you may be interested to x_sendfile_header setting to serwe that files with apache nginx which is faster

in my experience passing css js through controllers slower than pure apache nginx request

nginx s static file performance is better than apache

i would really like not to run both apache and nginx i did switch everything to apache yet found it loaded my proxies slower than nginx

apache and nginx can do it faster

it s just a little slower than using apache bench directly against nginx

very fast static assets nginx is faster than apache at serving static assets css js images ... and uses very little memory to do so

you might try running say apache or nginx which is even simpler to set up

nginx is typically faster than apache but with a low request server it hardly matters

there seems to be a consensus that nginx serves static content faster than apache

this is more efficient as the apache nginx daemons are far quicker than node at serving files

as an added benefit nginx can also serve static files much faster than apache and nginx also uses much less ram and can handle much more connections

for second your apache nginx are faster to deliver your js and html from angular instead tomcat for example

nginx will definitely work faster than apache

nginx â without any optimizations done â is much faster than apache

when i was googling info on nginx it appears to be faster than apache and works well in serving static pages

i will add that i ve often heard that nginx is faster than apache for serving static files to the point that it s sometimes worth using nginx for static files and reverse proxying to apache for dynamic content

i have recently read that nginx is faster than apache

not only is nginx supposedly faster than apache at delivering static content but this also offloads your rails application for every image stylesheet javascript or whatever other static content

serving static files with nginx is much more efficient than with apache

in fact according to a few stackoverflow posts here here nginx and apache perform better for serving static assets

or don t apache nginx are better etc

however since i m used to apache it was faster for me to configure the site to run on apache and switch to nginx when performance problems occured

i know nginx has lower memory footprint and little faster than apache in serving static files

i read that nginx is faster than apache and i want to try it with some of the projects and leave the others with apache

if you aren t using any of the other features of apache consider using something lighter and faster like lighttpd or nginx

nginx apache are much more efficient at handling static files like images css javascript files and will only pass dynamic requests those where the content is often read from a database or the content changes to be handled by the python code

you can serve it from for example nginx varnish which are usually faster than apache

i want to move to nginx since it s better than apache

for example nginx is considered faster than apache and a nodejs application is considered faster than a php application

nginx makes apache better

i am not an expert in deployment but in my experience nginx is much faster and more friendly to django compared to apache

i switched from apache to nginx to save memory especially to serve static file i seem to be using about 75 less memory with nginx

in other words serving static files from django will have worse performance than using apache or nginx

good at serving static files it s slower than apache and nginx

one of the main advantages people discuss when choosing nginx over apache is higher performance in serving large numbers of static file so when using laravel are those static files loaded as dynamic php files

and finally from my experience nginx is faster than apache

nginx works great by itself and will likely be much faster than apache

paradoxally it does not mean that apache is faster than nginx it just means that on 1 2 3 .

nginx is faster than apache and the configuration is easier

i ve read that nginx is faster for static pages but there are questions about its performance with php compared to apache s performance with php

for static file serving i found nginx performance lot faster than apache

for me apache is easier to use but i prefer nginx as it is much faster

apache is more popular and has more features nginx is smaller and faster and has less features

also what makes nginx better than apache in this case

nginx is faster than apache handles slow clients better and is generally easier to use

apache and nginx are faster than django because they do much less and much simpler things


better polling long
apache made a claim that apache 2.4 will offer performance as good or better than nginx

using a different server such as one apache and one nginx or one apache and one lighttpd will be much easier because their configuration files don t conflict with each other

you don t want to use apache because nginx is better suited since nginx is built for async i o

also you can run php behind nginx using php-fpm but that s quite a challenge to get working and for that reason apache may be a better choice

nginx + gunicorn is likely to work better than apache + modwsgi at this point in time

i don t know from your question if it s a requirement to keep using apache but if possible i think nginx would work much better for you here

why nginx might be better than apache when one is long polling and why long polling is better than periodically polling a server

if you have long-running requests i think the performance will be pretty bad because apache use one thread per connection nginx performs much better

nginx also happens to be better than apache at writing logfiles interestingly

16 cores apache would scale better than nginx while nginx would process more client requests

we have found that using servlets and those 3 different kinds of handlers instead one single type of modules the generic term for other servers like apache or nginx makes user-developments easier safer and faster

would be for running many php scripts all the same in the background - nginx be the better solution or apache

as other already suggested nginx + gunicorn or better nginx + uwsgi are better options than apache + mod_python to serve your django app

nginx with its own mod_wsgi seems to perform even better than apache but hey you didn t ask about that

uwsgi is better if you are using nginx i find nginx far better than apache personally

using nginx rather than apache to server the images nginx generally works better to server static content such as this

as such i m assuming that about 96 of our users will being using apache and not lighttpd or nginx which are supposedly more suited for long polling

i aways heart that nginx performs better than apache server

alternatively would phusion passenger with nginx or apache handle this better

so you can do a django redirect_to urlconf entry but you d be better off with an apache or nginx or insert-your-webserver-here redirect so the initial request never has to hit django at all

nginx apache fits better with nodejs

i will say that nginx tends to handle heavier loads better than apache though so take a look at that

therefore serving and caching images from nginx or apache still seems the better choice

my app is a python wsgi with cherrypy and works perfectly in appfog but i don t wan t cherrypy to serve static content i think that apache or nginx is a better option for that

i tested both for apache and nginx webservers got comparatively better results in nginx

i recommend you to use nginx as an reverse proxy since the configuration is easier and the performance is much better than apache

having nginx in front of apache is a better set up in my opinion

nginx can be configured to only respond to requests matching a predefined pattern far easier than with apache

further than that i wouldn t use apache at all if i needed to optimize things nginx is much better as a server it s even faster than node.js for serving static files for example

if you want to use something in front of it though i suggest you use something like nginx better than apache since nginx is also asynchronous like node and it s performs really well at serving static files

i think you would like lemp e stands for the nginx and for a lot small projects it would be better than apache

i dont recomend apache to do these nginx fits better with nodejs

the remote server is set up to allow very few maximum concurrent clients generally nginx handles many concurrent clients better than apache since it doesn t need to fork a new process for every request so if it becomes an issue you might want to look into switching web servers

nginx is better at handling requests since it does not spawn a new process for every request unlike apache

4 i d like to understand why nginx might be better than apache when one is long polling and why long polling is better than periodically polling a server


server efficient model
also when your setting up the server i would say start with nginx it s uses less resources than apache

nginx or other server is not much more efficient than apache

next you ll find that the threading model of nginx is much more efficient than apache s for what you re doing

i tend to prefer leaving the cors handling to the http server nginx apache it gives more flexibility to the people deploying your app

also you should consider using nginx as server that s more flexible than apache

nginx is more performant than apache in most cases with high-levels of requests


http couchdb cleaner
the advantages here are that you can block off certain methods or certain parts of couchdb using nginx apache which is typically more flexible than the http options available in couchdb

apache mod_php is much more stable and cleaner while nginx will often deliver http bad gateway error coded in 502


windows opinion django
having deployed django behind both apache and nginx in windows i have to say that i found nginx to be infinitely easier

nginx is actually quite a lot easier than apache in my opinion


need alot specific
nginx is quicker though honestly you ll struggle to see the difference except for very high volume sites and has quickly become the web server of choice for a lot of people if you don t have any specific need for apache for your code

there is no need to use apache or ffmpeg nginx would be alot easier


memory connections processes
however i m on a memory limited vps and i d rather not run one set of php-cgi processes for nginx with their own apc cache and another for apache using more memory for their apc cache

nginx or lighttpd in fastcgi mode use less ram than apache and they can handle more concurrent connections

also have a look at nginx for example it is fast and uses less memory than apache to handle client connections


crypt	md5---------------------------------------------------

unrecoverable built-in approach
i should also mention that crypt has this built-in and may be a better solution than md5

my sense is that encode and decode are probably good solutions when you want the data to be recoverable but that unrecoverable hash using crypt md5 is a better approach for stored passwords


ssd	sata---------------------------------------------------

pop-up	dialog---------------------------------------------------

better window larger
the dialog pop-up is bigger than the browser window when opened

this will allow it to pop-up like a dialog but give you more flexibility and easier to manipulate imho

code like the following .after it running for about half a minute then close the window then the python has stopped working dialog pop-up you had better try more than once

is there a way to allow the pop-up window to expand beyond the dialog but be bounded by the window and thus provide scrolling when the pop-up is larger than the window

the issue i m having is that when the height of the page is smaller than the pop-up it opens a dialog instead of a pop-up

i realize this is an older post but we just ran into the same issue and resolved it by setting the z-index of the bubble pop-up to something higher than the dialog window

a custom chooser dialog pop-up will be better for you in this case

however if you re making a pop-up dialog it s better to detect if the user is not on a mobile device then use the css position fixed

trying to build a page of charts asp control objects that are smallish and then when we click on the image a styled jquery modal dialog pop-up that displays a larger version of the chart

when a user clicks on a particular image a dialog window is supposed to pop-up and display a larger version of said image

dialog makes it easier for you to create a pop-up window with customized contents

use floating divs instead which looks like a modal dialog but are better than the pop-up

generally a pop-up is a better option for a login dialog and a pop-up would allow you to easily navigate to the main page


boxes box windows
when typing in the text box the autocomplete pop-up but is bigger than the remaining space in the modal dialog

one of the reasons why your picker is not showing is because of pop-up dialog having a higher z-index value

because of datebox pop-up z-index is less then your box mean dialog box s z-index it shows behind pop-up panel

the pop-up windows are very easy to implement and the modal dialog boxes are even easier

from a practice standpoint - excluding accessibility - modal windows provide an alternative that are less startling as say dialog boxes and feel less intrusive than pop-up windows


information entry details
the user should be able to click on a row in the grid and get a pop-up dialog showing some more details about that row

i am trying to make a dialog pop-up that displays more information about an entry in a listview


ui anchor instance
i am using jquery ui dialog to show more than one pop-up on one page each pop-up will have its own id and it will be triggered by an anchor with a attribute

but i dont like system pop-up and think more userfriendly will be customized pop-up section for instance jquery ui dialog


mouse	keyboard---------------------------------------------------

events rendering useful
it s a more stateless way to declare your mouse and keyboard events relying less on the required ordering of your rendering

instead methods like .live or .on since the former is deprecated are more useful with mouse and keyboard events generally speaking


easier better thing
essentially you want the mouse to be an option but the keyboard to be a better easier more convenient one

the only thing i can think of that is easier with the mouse than with the keyboard is resizing windows


hand ctrl combination
the ctrl key is usually close by my keyboard hand and in combination with the mouse is faster than the page up page down keys

there is an addon that can even remove the menu bar â you ll need to learn keyboard shortcuts this is a good idea anyway moving a hand to from the mouse is much slower


faster slower
the keyboard is almost always faster than the mouse

doing it with mouse is much more slower than it can be done with keyboard


functionality concept radical
sendmessage type functions will be slightly slower since they have more coding inside them allowing them to work with more than just mouse and keyboard functionality

this is a radical concept i know but the mouse is slower than keyboard shortcuts


floor	sqrt---------------------------------------------------

cellbitlength smaller divider
you re missing some dividers if a b c and b is a divider of a then c will also be a divider of a but c might be greater than floor sqrt a for example 3 floor sqrt 6 but divides 6

reason n + floor sqrt n is greater than n

assuming as you propose that out may reference either lhs or rhs and that a and b have cells of uniform bit-length in order to technically be able to perform the multiplication in place elements of a and b as signed integers generally cannot be greater or smaller than â floor sqrt 2 cellbitlength - 1 4


stateless	stateful---------------------------------------------------

ejb3 faster jsf
for certain kinds of transactions a stateless session may perform slightly faster than a stateful session

service to build drools knowledge and get session i prepared a stateless engine lighter than the stateful one

in ejb3 there is no such thing as stateless is better than stateful session beans

while this is much less convenient than stateful wicket i still find much better than say stateless jsf or struts


webclient	httpwebrequest---------------------------------------------------

use keepalive convenient
use httpwebrequest instead of webclient it s slightly less convenient but not by very much and set the keepalive property to false

use httpwebrequest instead of webclient it s just more robust


easier control flexible
also using a separate httpwebrequest or webclient gives you more control over proxies handling redirection authentication etc

while webclient may appear to be easier to use than httpwebrequest it is less flexible and will automatically perform it s callback on the ui thread and if you re downloading files in the background you almost certainly don t want this

webclient is easier but httpwebrequest is more powerful and allows for more control


slower milliseconds higher
using webclient is potentially slightly on the order of a few milliseconds slower than using httpwebrequest directly

because webclient is higher class of httpwebrequest and its slower


level lower accomplish
if httpwebrequest response are lower level then webclient what can i accomplish with httpwebrequest response that i cannot accomplish with webclient

httpwebresponse and httpwebrequest are a little bit lower level than webclient


glut	glfw---------------------------------------------------

opengl menus posters
edit explained as i m guessing you are somehow forced to use glut but i agree with other posters glfw is a better option if you can choose

or if you re really focused on only doing opengl i may suggest using glfw which is the better glut but you ll have to draw the menus yourself using opengl


shadowing	named---------------------------------------------------

multiplying	subtraction---------------------------------------------------

numeric addition multiplication
either way your example with the numeric expression would multiplying by 3 first because multiplication has higher precedence than addition or subtraction

since multiplication has a higher precedence than subtraction you should subtract 0 to your digit character before multiplying it


median	percentile---------------------------------------------------

subtract	addition---------------------------------------------------

division basic level
on most processors a boolean operation has no reason to significantly be slower or faster than an addition both are basic instructions even though comparison may take two of them subtract then comparing to zero

division is performed by repeated subtraction therefore needs more level of subtract logic making division slower than addition

since addition can be faster then subtraction we add the offset instead of subtract it from 31


rank	percentile---------------------------------------------------

mvp	presenter---------------------------------------------------

data implementation details
i have been searching on the net and i made a couple of examples of both of them but i m even more confused because in some sample web pages mvp uses more than 2 interfaces to communicate the presenter with the view layer some ones even have completely blank interfaces only declarated but in other ones it only takes two interfaces to transport data from presenter to view

mvc framework is suitable only for web applications while mvp can be more universal and can work for web forms and windows forms - views implement interfaces for presenter to use and views themselves handle implementation details pertaining to navigation


bottle	flask---------------------------------------------------

heavy results application
if you re looking for something less heavy than django perhaps try flask or bottle

i m building an application in both bottle and flask to see which i am more comfortable with as django is too much batteries included

if you re looking for small implementations you might get better results with bottle or flask

you might be better off looking at something more usable such as flask bottle etc

in this approach you won t get much from django you are better of with bottle flask


gridview	datalist---------------------------------------------------

data datatable older
gridview and datalist are better then the older versions

if you want to bind data to gridview datalist datalist controls then better option you should use datatable dataset or you can use list ex list

from what you re describing perhaps a gridview or datalist is a better option


realloc	malloc---------------------------------------------------

concern stage standard
the standard way to do this is to use malloc to allocate an array of some size and start reading into it and if you run out of array before you run out of characters that is if you don t reach eof before filling up the array pick a bigger size for the array and use realloc to make it bigger

now you either use realloc or assign a bigger space to pointer1 with malloc at earlier stage

in the above code i attempt to make a pointer to a dynamic array of structs unsure if i succeeded in that part but my main concern is i use malloc to create space on the heap for the array people. later in the code i create another struct person and use realloc to create more space on the heap for people. i then write to memory outside of what i thought i gave space for by doing people 5 .someone rob


data things need
you could have some initial guess for maxsize 8 and grow when needed your data perhaps by using realloc or just by malloc -ing a bigger new chunk copying the older chunk inside then free -ing that older chunk

a realloc can occur significantly faster than a malloc memcpy and free

you will have to initially use malloc and then use realloc to allocate more memory on each step

in this context free store is different and incompatible with heap because the new delete free store library is simpler and quicker than the malloc free realloc calloc heap library and thus provides huge memory usage gains to the c++ embedded programmer in a context where you have only 512 bytes of ram

generally new delete and malloc realloc free arrange for more memory from the os using sbrk or os-specific-equivalent and divide the pages up however they like to satisfy the program s allocation requests

a malloc free pair can be better than a realloc if you don t need to keep around the original memory

i m not saying that realloc is worse than implementing realloc using a malloc free

if new is greater than old malloc additional pointers on the end of the array instead of trying to realloc them

that s why realloc can temporarily require more memory than a malloc free pair

if you want to instrument libc s malloc calloc realloc things are even simpler - just wrap them in your allocator functions

realloc is worse than malloc in that you will need to have the old and new pointers valid during the realloc

in the case of overflow a free malloc pair costs less than realloc because of its internal hidden memcpy

use of malloc or realloc can give you better way to allocate memory

if you work with data that doesn t need construction destruction and requires reallocations a large array of ints then i believe malloc free is a good choice as it gives you realloc which is way faster than new-memcpy-delete it is on my linux box but i guess this may be platform dependent

in c you would use malloc to get memory realloc to get more memory and free to release memory

malloc free is harder because thereâ s also calloc and realloc

dynamic memory management on an small embedded system is tricky to begin with but realloc is no more complicated than a free and malloc of course that s not what it does


gridview	repeater---------------------------------------------------

better performance needs
in simple words we can say performance of repeater is far better than gridview

it sounds like a repeater or gridview might be better suited to your needs

maybe a repeater is better but you will be fine with a gridview if you are familiar with it


easier table nested
that makes all just more difficult without a benefit in this case even if a nested repeater or gridview would be easier

edit using a gridview might be easier then a table since you only need to bind in the itemdatabound the dataset to the gridview in the repeater


faster big suitable
the repeater is still faster than the gridview but the difference shouldn t be big if you code it right

in my understanding repeater is most suitable since it faster than gridview


control output markup
alternatively use a gridview though i find that repeater gives you more control over the emitted markup

not necessarily better than the repeater suggestion but another option is to use a gridview control and a datatable data structure

using repeater contorl over gridview will give you more control over formating your output

the repeater will allow more control over what is rendered instead of rendering a tabular output as in the case of gridview


mouseleave	mouseenter---------------------------------------------------

fadeto method pointer
in this case mouseenter mouseleave has better behaviour and prevents bubbling compared to mouseover mouseout

as kaveman suggested mouseenter and mouseleave would be much better events to put the code in

also if you want a hover effect you re better off with mouseenter and mouseleave which jquery provides for browsers that don t already support it

i suggest using hover this instead of binding to mouseenter and mouseleave looks cleaner to me

in my opinion it gives a nicer solution than the mouseenter and mouseleave event

and the second problem is that i want to use hover or hoverintent method better than mouseenter and mouseleave but im not sure how to use fadeto to get the same effect

i ve tried to set it to other value and it works - mouseenter and mouseleave events are fired earlier

i find using mouseenter and mouseleave to be better than hover

also instead of mouseover and mouseout use the better ones mouseenter and mouseleave or simply the .hover method

some browsers implement the mouseenter mouseleave events that i ve noticed are more accurate than mouseout

edit2 you may have better results with mouseenter and mouseleave too i think

take a look at mouseenter and mouseleave events they are better than mousemove and mouseenter combinations

i have no idea about the classes but i think mouseenter and mouseleave are better alternative for mouseout and mouseover

finally if you want to optimize your program to number of lines - trading off engineering practices - you ll have a shorter program with mouseenter and mouseleave events

it should also be noted that mouseenter and mouseleave work somewhat differently and usually much better than mouseover and mouseout

firstly i think you will find that mouseenter and mouseleave are better events for this kind of thing

i think mouseenter mouseleave is better than hover

i m also aware that mouseenter and mouseleave would be far better than hover in this situation i just typed it up as hover for speed

hover wraps around mouseenter and mouseleave to provide even better handling

you can simulate an anchor using css cursor pointer and events like mouseenter and mouseleave which is more work but does not break the expected behavior of an anchor tag


mousedown use appropriate
imho mouseenter and mouseleave are much more reliable than mouseover and mouseout which tend to flicker

this may make for various race conditions and may necessitate using events which give you earlier notification than mouseup mousedown mouseenter mouseleave mouseover mouseout

maybe mouseenter and mouseleave are more appropriate for your use case

also you might want to use mouseenter and mouseleave which are sanitized by jquery and are a little more reliable than mouseover and mouseout

lastly the hover creates two events of which the mouseleave isn t needed for your code so you can use just mouseenter to make it more efficient

because jquery doesn t use mouseover and mouseout it uses mouseenter and mouseleave which are more suited to this scenario


vsto	add-in---------------------------------------------------

np-hard	np-complete---------------------------------------------------

best polynomial mean
it is not easier than the np-complete problem since it can be reduced to it in polynomial time which makes the problem np-hard

if there exists a np-hard problem that is not in np to the best of my knowledge no such problem has been proved to fall in this category at this moment of time such problem is harder than np-complete problems

is that mean np-hard problems that are not np-complete are harder


django	turbogears---------------------------------------------------

atom-editor	sublimetext---------------------------------------------------

packages performance better
atom-editor is still missing a lot of packages that sublimetext supports so the question is will atom-editor catch up with sublimetext or become some better

sublimetext has better performance than atom-editor


phpunit	behat---------------------------------------------------

keydown	keyup---------------------------------------------------

example button silently-ish
keyup is more preferable than keydown because keydown may occur multiple times if user keeps it pressed

also note that keydown is better for this methodology as keyup will fire multiple times though i guess this will too.

edit keydown is a little better than keyup for the element bind now enter key fails silently-ish

i finally figured out that keypress has a better compatibility than keydown or keyup on linux platform

they have their differences better stick to one i prefer for this example to use keydown just plays better with me you can use keyup

also if you notice i ve changed the keyup event to keydown which is better in my opinion cause when the user holds their finger down on a button the code wouldn t be fired if it is on the keyup event


keypress sense newest
also note that using keyup or input makes far more sense than keydown otherwise the previous value will only be evaluated on the next event occurrence

then the right events to do it is keyup more than keydown since the value isn t yet in the field at this moment or on change

i wrote a plug-in a short while ago that will handle text input much better than keypress keyup and keydown events

as you can see the keyup events of numpad5 and numpad6 occured earlier than their keydown event

use .val and .keyup using keydown doesn t register the newest value it registers the value before so keyup is better to use for this

its what s used for keyboard input in wpf way more than the keydown and keyup events


ssl	https---------------------------------------------------

tls better
always use tls which is ssl which is https more or less

ssl tls provide better encryption decryption over https


virtual host ip
as far as i know you cannot configure more than one https virtual host for each ip that s it name based virtual hosting is limited to only one ssl virtual host

it could be a sni problem if you use any kind of load balancer https proxy or more than 1 ssl certificate on the same ip

there is a limitation on creating virtual hosts for name based virtual host while using ssl 443 port so if you want to have more than one https port enabled you will need ip based virtual hosting


http client issues
you could always use https that will work both on http and https websites but loading a https resource is slower than loading a http resource because of the encryption and ssl handshakes

as last resort resolution i don t suggest this for security issues using ssl is always safer switch your registry to use http instead of https

you can optionally handle http 403.4 code ssl required more gracefully by automatically redirecting the client to the https version of the page


handshake http applicable
the ssl handshake overhead associated with https is more than 50 of the bandwidth currently

http is slightly more performant than https as the ssl handshake doesn t need to happen however anybody hackers can see everything that your users can see

this being said the rfc 6125 guidelines meant to be applicable to any protocol that uses ssl tls are more or less the same as those for https which are defined in rfc 2818 http over tls section 3.1


secure certificate
if you do it over ssl https it is probably more secure

i m assuming using https without a ssl certificate is atleast more secure than doing the exact same connection over plain http since atleast it s encrypted and an evildoer would have to make a much larger effort to intercept en decrypt the information


mbunit	nunit---------------------------------------------------

data mstest etc
nunit is more widespread mbunit has the most features but mstest has more manpower behind it

mbunit has compatible syntax with nunit but has more features especially data driven tests

i ve read time and time again that tdd test first is more difficult with mstest than it is with other testing frameworks such as nunit mbunit etc.


popular feature-rich offers
from what i have read on here i here that nunit is more popular over mbunit

nunit is more popular because it was there first therefore more articles about it on the web and better tooling and because most programmers don t care about or need the advanced features that mbunit offers

even though nunit now includes the most popular mbunit advanced features mbunit is still more feature-rich for example


folder	directory---------------------------------------------------

git bin terminal
if you are comfortable with the terminal app you can switch to the project s folder directory and do ls -lf .git

unfortunately the directory also is a git repository and has a .git folder in it which is much bigger than the directory itself

what i thought is that if i can configure launchagent or daemons then i will provide path to mongod of bin directory of mongodb folder and provide --config and path for .conf file as argument and then i need to just launchd mongod using launchctl with name mongod and it will start

i did first try deleting the .svn folder from the bin directory but all that did was cause it to complain that the bin dir was no longer under source control and halt


files older days
remove the directory if the date contained in the folder name is older than 3 months

i wrote this function and it seemed okey but it fails if there are more than one folder in the current directory and no files

i have tested on mp3 files in different directory it takes less than one second with over 6000 files stored in different folder

all of the object files are dumped into the output directory and the executable is placed in a different folder that is kept cleaner

the above works deleting .bak files older than 7 days in those folder my question is how can i reverse that and delete .bak files in every other directory that s older than 3 days without deleting the ones kept from the first query

it might have been faster for listing whole directory but when filtering out files and only accepting folder it takes far more time

2.create a .txt file inside the raw directory folder you created earlier and give it any name eg.articles.txt...

file must be in the same or higher directory as target folder

i am using the bash ftp command to ftp files however i have a problem where i try to create a directory that is more than 2 folder deep

but is it at all possible to write one using an already made directory structure with files and folder that must remain as they are the web folder i described earlier

but in my include directory there is also a opencv2 folder which has more subfolders and in general more files

i need help in a vba macro that ll delete files in a directory that contains more than 2 _ and is older than 3 months old however there are some folder sub folder in the directory that must not be touched or modified

if directory folder atob has more than 1 item aaa.xyz let prune other folder file in same way

looking at the gulpfile i see no transfer of css files from source directory to target directory happening only less files from the src less folder are handled there

linux server how can i copy overlapping files from backup folder with subfolder directory with all subfolders and files to newer folder directory withhout touching newer pre-existing files

here s the directory structure for the application i m just listing the relevant files folder to make it more readable

i am running into an issue where for some of the folder there are too many subfolders and it spits out the directory name k really long path blah is too long not the actual dir- the actual dir is longer than 260 chars

i would recommend placing the common files in the same directory as the solution file or no more than 1 folder deep

unfortunately including .class only goes two directory deep and does not copy any files that are deeper than two directory inside of the bin folder

if you always show all the files i suspect the single folder may be faster since you will have to run through the whole directory listing doing multiple file listings

you can get a filtered list of files in a folder directory using file#listfiles filenamefilter

i have a folder named documents within that i have 3 000 text files and two sub directory which contains more thousands of text files

note that once the cache installer is done then it seems there is a service that is sweeping this directory and putting older files into the logsbackup x directory which is also in this folder

so currently i have two loops running within another i don t know if this is like taboo or something d but what i m aiming for is if the number of files in a directory pages are more than in another directory posts i want it to delete the corresponding files in the pages folder

it s faster to the operating system reach the file when you have 100 folder with 100 files inside i see a lot of improvement when i split one directory that had more than 20.000 files inside

i have login.jsp forgotpass.jsp files in webapps directory i have 2 more jsp file under web-inf jsp folder

there is another lib folder in home username directory which contains older version of pythons also

it removes files and folder from a server directory that are older than 8 days

i m trying to write a script that deletes all folder that are older than 60 days and create a logfile with the folder names in the directory where the folder have been deleted

i know that this command works for removing all folder in the directory that are older than n days

in 1 directory it removes folder older than 30 days and the other removes files older than 30 days

i m just writing a little batch script that is supposed to look in a specific directory for folder that were created more than x days ago

would need monitoring on below folder for respective directory sub directory to see if the files in the directory are greater than 100 files

in every profile directory there are more folder and files

rm -rf directory also works faster for billion of files in one folder

unfortunately this means i need to manually create each folder then import the two files then for both files set the build action to none and copy to output directory to copy if newer

how can i check the date of the folder in the directory and delete those older than a certain date

you risk filename collisions by putting your files directly in the static folder vs adding one more directory and putting them in there

what i would like to know is whether there is something in php that could check test in some simple way whether a folder directory contains file older than sometime or even how many of such files are there without any kind of manual go-through

so i m making a music management-type software that currently reads through the files in the directory you give it more specifically the files in that folder

if any of the folder in this directory are older than 14 days it will then delete them and their sub-directories

so my task is simple i have created the makefile new with makefiles and i want to keep my .o files in a different folder to have a cleaner directory and allow the usage of .o files by others

i ll then copy the file to that folder run my command against it provide a link to the file and i ll have some service that runs every now and then that deletes directory that are more than a day old

i am trying to write one script which scan logs directory and move logs older than 10 days to other folder

the better way is to actually drop the file into a tmp folder echo a link to that file and then delete all files in that directory that are older than x minutes

i m trying to create a script that deletes all files and folder that are older than 24 hours but it should not delete a directory until all the files in it are older than 24 hours

condition is i need to move all folder which are older than 30 days inside parent directory

and if your csv files are stored in more than one directory you will want to pass the folder name as a parameter too

my files are organized in many directory folder and inside each primary directory i have more folder and inside those folder i have other folder and so on

this folder has way more than 1 directory and has a bunch of files so apparently it snot reading something correctly

so my question is how do i determine what the last modified file is from more than one directory actually need it for four different folder

if i run ls folder | head in a directory with a lot of files the execution time is about 50 times faster than ls folder | tail

iterate over the directory and skip the folder which are in text file and remove other folder which are more than 30 days old

i created a php file which deals with file deleting and uploading but i this file is one directory lower than the folder for files

i need to create a simple program which goes through a user-given directory on sharepoint and finds all the folder which are older than 1 month and then it copies them to some local hard drive


earlier root virtual
and using visual studio online i can build and deploy the site into root folder but i couldn t figure it out how to deploy into a virtual directory i have created earlier

lets change the root directory of the repos to the repo folder we made earlier


level top ws
i am trying to have an easy way to update a program i am working on by being able to just place replacement .py files in a folder which i then put at the top of the sys.path list so all import statements will first check that folder and not my top level directory importing the newer .py files and not the ones used to build the program originally with pyinstaller

then go to var folder ws jfsjfe34094fsfk_qy4l505353fs t this directory is just one level higher from the staging directory that was created earlier

i need to make sure that each of these top mail directory sa44-3 is not larger then 8gb so the script should calculate the size of each top level folder and if its over 8gb create a new one called eg


images joulie several
ideally we would like to find the names of every image in a directory so users can just throw some images in the folder to add more logos

there are more than 1000 folder inside this directory which are mainly celebrity name like angelina joulie etc and inside that folder several images are there for that celebrity


new css file
i then placed my less file with the same name as my css file in a folder named less in the root directory of my project

in given new root folder create one more directory with the name of the directory which will be moved to this new root folder

the genisoimage man page suggests using -r or -r which has better defaults for ownership in addition since the rock ridge standard supports 255 byte file names and folder depths greater than 8 directory and is a real standard unlike joliet

when i moved the project folder to the new directory the file directory names became longer and some particular files names became longer than the character limit for the windows file naming system

actually adding a new resource folder does nothing more then adding it as a resource directory in build.gradle

you can either prepend a dot to your image address which means go to parent directory meaning get out of css and then look for images or you can move your images folder to your css folder whichever is more comfortable for you

another tip if you want to add more folder to ros more folder where it can look for packages just set ros_package_path ros_package_path new directory you want


user higher locations
if you are using the command prompt and are within the mydocuments folder of your pc you must back out of that folder to get closer to the higher directory c by typing the ..

unfortunately looks like it requires uninstaller and reinstall as the locations seems to have changed drastically from some subsubsub folder off of appdata to something higher up under user directory

go to your user directory c profiles youruser there should be a folder called .m2 may be hidden

simply i just kept only the latest .android folder in this directory c users user name removed the duplicated one and then emulator started working for me


file argument obj
if you need more information you can either calculate the value based on the mail folder or save some more on nsuserdefaults or even create a plist file on your document directory

value for -sym argument should be local directory on your disk for obj local armeabi folder that contains libndk_databases.so file


level structure root
but my directory structure is more organized its more like app lib mypackage folder

if the root folder will be more than one level above in the directory structure you can always do this

in future if they add more than one directory at the root level i will handle it but for now you can assume they will only put in one top level folder


war easier creation
i want to add my src main proto directory as an eclipse source folder to make editing easier

since a war folder necessarily precedes the creation of a .war archive since a .war archive is simply a zipped up war directory obtaining the war directory is provably easier than obtaining a .war file


user additional calls
but this was restrictive as all calls to the repairs folder were redirected to index.php so thought renaming the folder would be a better way forward as a user would be able to navigate to other files within the directory

since it is impossible to know for certain how many files or directory which themselves could contain additional directory containing still more files or folder will be selected and dropped by user the a single or recursive calls to traversefiletree require some mechanism to determine when all asynchronous operations have completed


use temporary createfromdirectory
if you are using a linux mac unix machine most of time i have had to either start from the root folder such as users .....to the source folder or when using a directory that is closer just use in front of it

due to this i create a temporary directory and use createfromdirectory but i don t want copy the same folder to other location in the disk almost the zipped already folder is better


sub images smaller
4132808 so it shows that under images directory there are more than 5 million sub folder.is it ok to keep that much folder under one directory

test code updated so you can see that both it works identically whether using varargs or not will fail if your home directory has less than 5 sub folder

as a result each folder may contains 4 images along with 4 sub directory that contain the smaller more detailed images


output newer copy
in the properties of those files you could set copy to output directory to copy if newer and so everytime you run the application they will be copied to the bin debug folder alongside with the executable and in your application you could access them as relative files file.readalltext myfile.txt

the idea is that if any files in the bin debug directory are newer than the corresponding .nuspec file found two folder above bin debug then the mainbuild target should execute

do i just add it under the resources folder in solution explorer and set the file properties buildaction to content and copy to output directory to copy if newer

so if you were to assign a variable to executenonquery and the results show a value higher than 0 then you will need to set copy to output directory to do not copy and then manually copy the database into the bin debug or bin release folder or set copy to output directory to copy if newer which means unlike copy always this value will only copy the database to the app folder if you make any changes to the database in the project folder

i set the property of copy to output directory to copy if newer for the node js file cmd.exe and the node modules files and they are being generated in the bin folder

to set it to copy to the output folder right click on the ssdl file in solution explorer and change copy to output directory to copy if newer

i moved that file in the content folder of my project and changed the copy to output directory to copy if newer

copy xml to output folder manually or automatically set kunden.xml build action to none but copy to output directory to copy if newer

move content folder to assets and for each resource file set the build action to androidasset and set copy to output directory to copy if newer


better modrewrite scripts
i had kept all my testng jar files in a separate folder to organize better in eclipse project s lib directory while the rest of my jar files were directly in the lib directory

my directory is applications mamp htdocs website - i have other projects in the folder htdocs but if the modrewrite works in all folder would be even better

instead i want those scripts to look in a custom directory let s say dependencies folder in the main project first so that i can directly put those externals in that folder which is much easier than putting them into the vc folder or manually setting the paths


current shortcut better
change your paths to relative paths which mean they just have the bit of the path from the current directory in this case the projecta source1 bit if you ve set your current directory to your dropbox folder or just source1 if you ve set your current directory to the projecta folder which is a better idea

if i m not mistaken when capistrano makes the current folder it is actually a shortcut for lack of a better term to the most recent release perhaps symlinked directory is better

directory.getcurrentdirectory will give you the current folder which is more of a context as you can create a shortcut and pass a completely different folder as your current directory than the one where your exe is present


specific base bower
i have the base directory mentioned for bower components in .bowerrc but need some one dependency in specific folder in the project

the problem is that i ve now accumulated a bunch of backup folder in each project directory which makes it harder to find the specific change i was looking for


orientdb	neo4j---------------------------------------------------

faster small slower
using orientdb that is supposed ti be faster than neo4j for depth i m seeing a slow performance

i found that orientdb is too slow at least much slower than neo4j even on relatively small 150k datasets when searching records by text pattern despite the presence of indices


strcpy	memset---------------------------------------------------

macro safer strings
your macro with memset and memcpy was not any safer than strcpy

you could use memcpy memset for strings too but strcpy is simpler


lxml	html5lib---------------------------------------------------

faster job html.parser
lxml parser is generally faster html5lib is the most lenient one - this kind of difference would be relevant if you have a broken or non-well-formed html to parse

html5lib parser does a better job than lxml or html.parser handling the debate element in this case


countif	sumifs---------------------------------------------------

explode	substr---------------------------------------------------

solutions regular str_replace
which should at least perform better than explode str_replace and substr solutions

you don t need regular expressions at all you could use explode substr is probably better but i want to show another alternative


width	border-box---------------------------------------------------

display-inline-block button screen
but the button in your example is less than 15px wide so even with box-sizing border-box the button s width is pushed larger than your percentage

there is one more solution besides setting box-sizing border-box and using a lower width value

if you need to have both fill the screen when the child is less than the width of the screen then both need min-width 100 and box-sizing border-box and you can remove the display-inline-block from the parent


hash-collision	key---------------------------------------------------

target different slower
but if your key space is vastly larger than the number of targets you ll have a sizable number of hash-collision where you ll have to check if the target stored there is really the key you re looking

it will only really matter if you have lots of hash-collision since then the get key call gets slower than o 1 - it gets o k with k being the number of entries in the same bucket the number of key with same hash code or a different hash code which gets still mapped to the same bucket - this depends on the capacity size and load factor of the map as well


worse possible concerns
if not md5 would also be suitable for this purpose since you are concatenating the bucket and path and using the hash to provide better key distribution not uniqueness so you have no hash-collision concerns

the more hash-collision you have the worse the performance of hash maps because much of the hash maps good performance relies on as few as possible key in the same hash buckets


javassist	cglib---------------------------------------------------

primes	modulus---------------------------------------------------

convincing argument large
someone else in this thread makes a somewhat convincing argument that modulus a primes is better for detecting bit-swapping

it would be better to use a large primes as the modulus and get much better collision resistance


p possible rsa
it is perfectly possible to use rsa with a modulus n that is composed of more than two primes factors p and q but two things have to be noted

some of the random values that you are encrypting are greater than the modulus of the key the modulus is the value of the 2 primes in the rsa key multiplied together which means values wrap-around if you set you will see that input and output always match


mp4	h.264---------------------------------------------------

alternative platforms free
it doesn t support avi at the moment but imho mp4 format is better suited for h.264 anyway

- you can also consider using webm which is a free alternative to h.264 and has better support on some platforms than fragmented mp4


haskell	scheme---------------------------------------------------

choices powerful declarative
if you want to learn functional programming on its own terms languages like haskell and scheme may be better choices

i think that functional declarative programming haskell scheme lisp etc is more powerful and more abstract than imperative programming and therefore is intrinsically harder to learn

i ve also read that scheme or haskell could be better languages to achieve this task


actualheight	actualwidth---------------------------------------------------

spaces	delimiter---------------------------------------------------

s preg_split
in this case i used one or more spaces as a delimiter s+

instead of explode use preg_split and then use s+ s spaces + 1 or more times as delimiter


file text method
it replaces all tags with spaces and str.split splits resulted text by one or more spaces as delimiter

a file with space-separated values is just a dialect of the classic comma-separated values csv file where the delimiter is a spaces followed by more spaces which can be ignored

i think spaces delimiter tags feel more like typing and you aren t syntactically bound to commas or pipes etc.

so by using s 3 i am telling the csv processor that the columns in a row are delimiter by more than 3 spaces

you are using the wrong delimiter since your text file may contain more than one spaces character between tokens

this method can handle more delimiter than spaces by the regex being used

since the file which has to read in have more than one spaces as the delimiter between some of the column the above method does not work

so i repeat and clarify my question from the heading how would i split the byear column into three or more columns with or spaces as delimiter

basically you split the string into an array using a spaces character as a delimiter so we can get an array of each word then reverse that array and join them back into a string with the spaces we removed earlier

but i think importing the text file into excel delimiter by spaces is quicker if this can be done


tab additional characters
if you want to allow for more delimiter than just spaces tab you can add additional separators when using split

besides the spaces there are more characters that are considered as delimiter by command prompt which are tab


punctuation words complex
the pattern in scanner is supposed to be a regular expression that describes all the characters you don t want included in a token repeated one or more times this last part is because the words may be delimiter by more than one spaces punctuation etc.

real life often involves more than merely spaces delimiter words

if you want to allow the integers to be delimiter by more than one spaces for indentation purposes or so and depending on the way you want to handle tabs and other non-newline whitespace you can use a more complex delimiter

by something fancier i m referring to more delimiter than spaces grammar punctuation etc

as you see i too mistrust whether the tab chars are real tabs and also use two or more spaces as delimiter

the alternative is to write slightly more complex c code which can split on either spaces or tabs note that you can pass strtok more than one delimiter


field comma regular
the code makes some reasonable assumptions but it may fail to detect an escaped field if its doublequote is followed or preceded by more than 3 spaces before after field delimiter

your actual delimiter looks more like comma followed by a spaces to me

when you call pandas.read_csv you can use a regular expression that matches zero or more spaces followed by a comma followed by zero or more spaces as the delimiter

it checks for one or more spaces as field delimiter and also tabs

to split the string with regular expression saying spaces one or more spaces one or more as delimiter

awk uses a comma surrounded by 0 or more spaces as field delimiter


better pipe stringjoiner
more than one spaces should be compressed to a delimiter pipe better

create new string which will collect edited versions of each word you can use stringbuilder or better stringjoiner with delimiter set as one spaces


webkit	gecko---------------------------------------------------

browser memory
which of these gecko or webkit uses less memory in general case

gecko is often considered to consume less memory than webkit but this depends a lot on how the browser is implemented


browsers individual operations
i m developing with canvas too and have found that webkit based browsers in general handle canvas operations quicker than gecko in most cases

fwiw i was able to solve my problem with greensock using tweenmax to animate individual paths inside and this worked in firefox gecko and webkit browsers safari google-chrome it does a better job of calculating the origin not exactly sure how but it worked for me


.htaccess	httpd.conf---------------------------------------------------

results root access
this goes in your root .htaccess but if you have access to httpd.conf that is better

instead of mucking with httpd.conf you might get better results with .htaccess


coalesce	isnull---------------------------------------------------

values first null
coalesce will go through the listed values and choose the first one that isn t null it s more portable code than isnull or ivnl etc

also you can make your code simpler by using isnull or coalesce to handle columns which contain nulls

you can also use isnull but coalesce allow more that two values you can use it for three or more columns like coalesce column1 column2 column3

i understand the difference between these functions but my question is when checking for a single null value would isnull be any quicker than using coalesce

i tend to use coalesce only when i need to get the first non-null value from a set of 3 or more values as isnull only supports two parameters


alternative standard
you could also use isnull but coalesce is more standard

coalesce is the more standard alternative of isnull


better faster ansi
in some circumstances isnull is faster than case or coalesce

isnull is faster than coalesce

this is pretty much the ifloop answer but isnull is slightly faster than coalesce

but depending on the answers to those questions i m guessing that coalesce might do the trick for you better than isnull

coalesce is the standard ansi way isnull gives slightly better performance although the difference is probably insignificant in most cases

isnull is better then coalesce because of how datatypes are handled

isnull is marginally faster than coalesce

in most cases it has reviled indexes that needed to be add and in most cases the indexes improved the queries the most but after thet have been added the isnull and dynamic still perform better than the coalesce

is the performance of coalesce field constant better than isnull

on the subject of performance on sql server isnull often performs better than coalesce but the latter is ansi compliant if that is important to you

isnull will be faster i think because it has lesser function code implementation for itself making it faster than coalesce

isnull can only have one input however it s been shown to be slightly faster than coalesce

you can use isnull also in place of coalesce as isnull is comparatively faster than coalesce

an example of why coalesce is better than isnull

you will find that coalesce works better than isnull here

note that i much much much prefer the ansi standard coalesce but sql server has done us the favor of documenting why isnull is better effort that imho could have been spent fixing the problem

note that in this case the isnull would do the same as coalesce but looks better for this application in case you add some new language

isnull performs better than the generic coalesce and better than having another and

i would see if i got better results with isnull instead of coalesce

edit based on the tests done by multiple people and by theory isnull seems to be a better option over coalesce


efficient statement query
the exact clause for your statements may be different - you may be able to replace the case statement with an isnull or coalesce to make it easier to manage

to prefer isnull over coalesce when given the choice is that isnull tends to produce query plans that are more efficient than coalesce

i saw a coalesce statement version but isnull is more efficient

hash	md5---------------------------------------------------

better authentication request
then when testing the password for correctness you hash it the same way and then compare the results -- sha1 is a common hash for this md5 is better than nothing

or you could employ a request signing scheme in which certain request fields are hash together with the password of the user basically sending the password without sending the password similar to digest authentication but you can use something better than md5


idea raw int
the idea is that an md5 hash of a string is normally shorter than the string itself and the index lookups on the hash are hence more efficient than those on the strings

even if you think an int hash isn t such a good idea using a 32 chars digest sha-1 md5 should be much faster for selects than the raw string right


smaller unsigned numeric
for a given instance in the dataset there is 50 chance that its md5 hash will be smaller than 2 127 assuming the hash are unsigned integers and a 25 chance that it will be smaller than 2 126 and a 12.5 chance that it will be smaller than 2 125

5 generate much larger random numbers and hash them using md5 to get a smaller numeric value we should rarely get collisions but i end up with larger than needed numbers again


sha1 larger stronger
finally sha1 hash are safer than md5 i tell you that because you used the md5 tag in your post

i think i understand the purpose of using sha1 as it s supposed to require more cycles than md5 to hash unhash and the salt is supposed to prevent the use of rainbow tables

according to moore s law computers are becoming exponentially faster hence computing hash functions becomes much cheaper in terms of time especially quick hash functions like md5 or sha1

then you run that string through a good hash algorithm--something like sha1 is fine even md5 is more than adequate despite reports to the contrary

however for security purposes it is highly recommended that you write a wrapped hasher that will hash the md5 hash using a stronger password hashing algorithm

the fact that bcrypt produces hash slower than md5 because of security reasons is also clear for me

as you see md2 is also much much shower than the other hash â the same outcome as with the php code but md5 is much faster than sha-1 and overall it took less time in delphi to do the same on the same machine as php

now personally i generally use a salt sha-256 hash on my passwords because i thought that md4 and md5 were no longer secure and that hashing a password multiple times would just put too much strain on a server for no practical benefit

if the hash function is more complex and cryptographically strong md5 or sha1 then it is theoretically not possible

hash ids are usually shorter than typical hash created by cryptographic hashing algorithms such as md5 or sha-256 and unlike these hash ids are usually reversible meaning we can decode the original value

also the hash algorithm itself is much slower than sha1 md5 sha1 md5 are made for speed - not a useful property when storing passwords

use hash and choose hashing algorithm that suits you well if possible something stronger than md5 but don t go all the way to sha512 either

you may want to use the rabin hash which is faster and more collision resilient than cryptographic hash such as md5 sha1 et al

also calculating md5 hash is significantly faster than sha-256 and should be favored for performance reasons for any application that doesn t rely on the hash for security purposes

any hash function like md5 sha1 sha256 etc obviously cannot be 100 unique - because they have a fixed length and due to the there must necessarily be non-unique results for input content that is larger than the hash

it doesn t even matter much what algorithm is used - one could even use md5 or md4 and the passwords would be just as safe there is a slight difference because computing a sha-1 hash is slower

the difference between crc32 and md5 is that md5 generates a larger hash that s harder to predict

murmur3 hash are faster then md5 but may not be suitable for cryptographic uses

valid choices for hashing include sha1 or md5 although sha1 is preferable because it produces a larger hash and is considered cryptographically stronger than md5


apache different passwords
actually you can insert the passwords as a simple md5 hash it will still work for letting the user login though it is recommended to then change the password through the front end system as the salt passwords are more secure

having looked at the existing accesses listed i can see that it doesn t appear to be using the salt md5 hash that s stated in the apache docs the hash password that s stored is different to what i m thinking i should expect the salt is significantly more than 2 characters and for security reasons i m reluctant to embed a particular password hashing algorithm in my code

you also need to make sure that your database does indeed have the right data for the username password that the password was indeed hash using md5 more about your use of md5 below and under passwords that they re of the correct type and their lengths long enough


proven shorter string
mac os x llvm gcc based crypt fuction is borked junk hardwired to only use des a proven breakable hash worse than md5

you should be generating a random string longer than an md5 hash not shorter

sha-256 uses 64 characters in the database but with an index on the column that isn t a problem and it is a proven hash and more reliable than md5 and sha-1

now whether you d be better off truncating the sha-1 hash or using a shorter hash such as md5 i don t know

the resulting page identifiers will also be shorter than md5 hash and will only contain digits so they will be easy to include in url query strings etc

because the two hash are calculated differently two files with the same md5 hash are no more likely to have the same sha-1 hash than two random files

however there exist large databases of md5 hash which are more likely to contain the password text than the md5 of it

joining in char 32 the character string of an md5 hash is more performant compared to joining on variable character fields


second 100kb higher
so if it takes 1 second to generate each hash it becomes a bigger time sink than it would have been had you used a fast hash such as md5 of a version of sha

it is likely that you could do an sha hash of 100kb in well less than 10 second though and though sha-1 is still theoretically flawed it is of higher strength than md5


better secure collisions
all hash functions have that problem but some are more robust than md5

to protect your user s passwords you need to do better than md5 hash the passwords

my sense is that encode and decode are probably good solutions when you want the data to be recoverable but that unrecoverable hash using crypt md5 is a better approach for stored passwords

with a salt md5 is much more secure than without but you re better off using one of the sha hash such as sha256managed

if you want the fastest encryption algorithm then there s no substitute for testing it yourself - somewhat strangely php s sha1 implementation is significantly faster than its md5 i know these are hash - this is to illustrate that performance depends on implementation as much as algorithm

the size of objectid is also smaller than the size of an md5 hash which is better for indexing

if you need a surrogate primary key using an auto_increment field is better than an md5 hash because it is fewer bytes of data and database backends optimize for integer primary keys

sha1 is better than md5 because it is a longer hash so can accept more values without collisions although collisions are still possible

as pointed out md5 is not a very secure hash there are much better ones to use sha256 is pretty good still i think bcrypt is even better for some definition of better .

however if you want to use the sha256 hash alogorithm which is better than the md5 then here s a code sample

using md5 would make it easier to crack a hash though

better hash functions md5 are slower

for security md5 is not the best method hash is much better

it s like complaining that a sha256 hash is bigger than an md5 hash - yep it is but only one of them might slow the attacker down for a while

other hash functions such as sha-1 also have hash collisions although it is much less likely than md5

using source control version numbers or an md5 hash would be better

this generally uses a hash algorithm that is much faster than md5

sha is better hash than md5

specifically if this input from untrusted users and they should not be able to trigger hash collisions use a more secure algorithm than md5

the hash idea should work minor note that sha-256 wouldn t present collisions md5 is no longer secure but it depends on the trade-off if the service involves something really really critical a client-side ssl certificate would be the best way to proceed

crypt with hash is simply more expensive than md5

you didn t elaborate on that point but if you were simply looking for a more secure algorithm than md5 take a look at hash coupled with an algorithm like sha512

using a non-reversible hash such as md5 is much more secure and you can store the hash value as clear text

thirdly use a better hash than md5 for passwords

if your php installation is too old even salt hash with md5 are better than two-encrypted password

if you are in a situation where it is possible that an adversary might decide to sit down and create a load of messages with specified crc32 hash to mimic other messages or just to make a hash table perform very badly because everything hash to the same value then md5 would be a better option

in the case of cryptographic hash functions like md5 it is even worse

md5 hash would be faster than comparison but slower than a normal crc-check

of course calculating a md5 or sha hash is much slower than calculating a crc32

the wrapper uses these in such a way that even the md5 implementation is significantly more secure than a simple hash

because sha256 hash are much longer than md5 hash you can detect the hash algorithm by looking at the length of the hash

however some of them like md5 have less possible hash and execute faster

yes sha1 is a better hash than md5

and instead of md5 you are better off using either sha256 or bcrypt hash

in that case some hash functions are somewhat faster than other md5 being one of the fast functions but md4 is faster and it is simple enough that its code can be included in any application without much hassle

some common examples are the crc checksums of which crc32 is very common but you can also relatively easily compute 64 or 128 bit or even larger crcs much much faster than an md5 hash

x86	64bit---------------------------------------------------

32-bit cpus amd
the x86_64 64bit platform is much more than twice the width of the x86 32-bit

some older 32-bit x86 cpus also worked internally with 32-bit integers and operations on 16-bit integers required more clock cycles due to translation to from 32-bit this is not true with more modern 32-bit or 64bit x86 processors as they allow copying 16-bit integers to from 32-bit registers and operating on them with fewer such penalties

operations on 64bit integers are faster on intel and amd 64bit x86 cpus than the same operations on 32-bit integers

amd64 64bit cpus have larger registers and more of them compared with x86 32 bit cpus

in fact for x86 64 processors performing 32-bit or 16-bit operations are less efficient than 64bit or 8-bit operations due to the operand prefix byte that has to be decoded

64bit amd and later intel machines run faster than 32-bit x86 machines because when amd designed the new instruction set they added more cpu registers and made sse math the default

for other types of programs though 64bit can be faster than 32-bit at least on x86 x64

newer primarily 64bit x86 cpus support a more advanced technique called page attribute tables that allow for per-table setting of these modes instead of having a limited number of low-granularity registers

no intel or amd x86 manuals ever guarantee atomicity of anything wider than 64bit except for lock cmpxchg16b so this talk of sse vector loads stores being atomic on some cpus isn t something that you can reliably take advantage of or detect when it s supported

however my tests have shown that on a 64bit system an anycpu prefer 32-bit application which i confirm runs 32-bit can allocate more memory than an x86 one


slower 32bit 32bits
assuming you are working with 32bit x86 64bit x64 is harder to deal with you would have to either

64bit code is not actually faster it is usually a bit slower than x86 code

faster than on x86 32bits but slower than x64 64bit


better performances specific
however if you don t have specific reasons to use anycpu then you could still use x86 because in some cases the performances are better than 64bit code

i had better luck with the x86 one than the 64bit version in win 7


memcmp	strcmp---------------------------------------------------

faster cleaner lengths
strcmp also works but memcmp is cleaner if you are comparing parts of two arrays together as my ip value had an octet stored in different indexes so i could easily just use the size 4 to cover 0 to 3 indexes

memcmp is simpler than strcmp and can be implemented even more efficiently in places where the strings are known to be properly aligned

if you always keep track of the lengths of your strings you can compare lengths and use memcmp which is faster than strcmp


ftp	telnet---------------------------------------------------

form complex html
it is optimized for downloading larger files where the setup overhead is amortized over the size and number of downloads http is very light-weight you can communicate to an http server using telnet much easier than ftp especially before passive ftp and is designed around html -- the concept that in the course of your navigation you will be visiting many different servers and grabbing only a couple of files at a time from each

ftp protocol is more complex than http or telnet form example


express	koa---------------------------------------------------

application faster restify
it shows that koa is faster then other framework but as this question is about express and restify express is faster than restify

it is very common to use a web application framework like express sails hapi or koa there are many more


des	aes---------------------------------------------------

method api least
according to this analysis aes rijndael-128 is more than twice as fast as des 3des with a bigger key size more secure

if you used aes then you might see a better speedup over the des 3des observations

i ve read that aes encryption is more secure than the triple des encryption ms is using in their example above

how ever if you insist to use some api in java i have to say that des is really old way to encrypted text 3des desede or aes will be better and safer both of them have already been supported since java6

triple des or aes are much better options

note that the effective key size of aes is larger than triple des

des is the least secure 3des is better but i d go for the aes

you re using des in your example which is a flawed and obsolete algorithm alternatively use 3des so i suggest moving to aes which provides better encryption

edit 3des is better than des in the sense that it s significantly more secure but still less secure than aes but its performance is of necessity significantly worse than aes des or twofish because you re essentially applying des three times

i know you said you don t care about how secure it is but if you chose des you might as well take aes it is the more up-to-date encryption method


modern timings slower
this shows that the timings are sensitive to buffering and that aes is faster than des

using des assuming it s a little faster than aes and requires a smaller key and

aes can be even much faster than des or 3des when the cpu supports aes-ni

des turned out to be even slower than aes but for my current requirements a much simpler algorythm rc4 is sufficient

des is usually substantially slower than aes on modern hardware and has keys that are far too short for modern use

aes will indeed yield a considerably faster result than des

if aes is negotiated it s faster than des and 3des used by default by older applications


ubuntu	linux---------------------------------------------------

faster slower system
i can understand windows 10 performing faster than linux on vm but why is the baremetal ubuntu so slow

while ruby and rails don t change as often as they did a few years ago the dev ecosystem still evolves faster than linux distributions like ubuntu can keep up with

i m testing some simple benchmarking calculations on win7 and linux ubuntu 16 to compare the timings and being wonder win appears to be much faster than linux

i m working with both ubuntu mac but i like staying with the linux system feels faster and more stable for me

i don t know why arch linux is slower than ubuntu on your machine

also symfony on windows with xampp will run much slower than on linux ubuntu system


precise packages small
i ve used python on windows and on ubuntu and linux is much cleaner

i used to code on linux ubuntu to be more precise but now i am using a windows machine 7 and 8.1

edit i am using a linux os ubuntu to be more precise

it has been now over one year i have trashed windows and moved to linux ubuntu to be more precise and i am using the ide zend studio combined with aptana studio for developing oo php5.3 websites

i am developing a small application in linux ubuntu to be more precise and at this point i have an executable a shared library .so a configuration file .conf with some settings to be read by the application at the beginning a data folder with images and other resources to be used during the application life-time resources that can be also modified deleted and of course i would need some file for logs and messages right now i am using syslog

i like ubuntu linux which has more than 27 000 packages in its universe repository. now you can run linux and windows at the same time


easier distro w
at home w ubuntu linux virtualbox is easier to maintain performs as well as i require and is free

although if you aren t interested in using adobe cs you can use ubuntu distro which is easier than other linux distro and quiet popular so you won t have any problem finding solution

under a gnu linux distribution like ubuntu everything is much more easier and you can just plug in your device without installing anything you just have to set the right permissions for the device once


codeigniter	yii---------------------------------------------------

curve smaller frameworks
yii has a higher learning curve than say codeigniter and cakephp

if you employ php frameworks like codeigniter yii maybe even cakephp which have comparatively smaller learning curves you will find your path wellpaved for you in php


jsf	wicket---------------------------------------------------

sorting	filtering---------------------------------------------------

objects data need
sorting all the objects before filtering is sure to take longer than filtering and then sorting a smaller data set

in the case of core data running with a local sqlite store your predicates and sort descriptors get turned into a sql query so there s no need to instantiate and work with objects â the sorting and filtering happens much more efficiently on the backend and constructing objects is necessary only for the results

the filtering on about 10 000 rows of data and sorting all happens in less than 50 milliseconds

in general the way to handle this issue with a managed bean is absolutely right but keep in mind that if you have to deal with big data it would be a performance problem because the programmatic way using java data objects including operations such as sorting filtering etc. is much more slower than to work with indexed data xp dominoview


longer step
but right now the sorting step is taking way longer than the filtering step so i would like to combine them in some way

for example filtering and sorting takes longer in java


paging round-trip server
i think the performance depends a lot on the data provider paging and sorting and filtering the data are easily the most expensive tasks when dealing with databases - so picking a renderer gridview listview repeater is more dependent on your comfort with that particular control

the reason of the choice local sorting paging and filtering will be typically more quickly as the round-trip to the server


faster range results
being queryable the data tables produce faster results with sorting and filtering with their defaultview dataview

you d still have to filtering to get a range though it ought to be faster than sorting at least

in terms of your speed query i d propose that your pseudomedian filtering is faster because it doesn t involve sorting

if almost all elements fail the filtering then it s considerably slower than just sorting everything since you ll end up selecting thousands of times

filtering indexing sorting all is simpler that way


efficient expensive index
this may be optimal indeed if the table access to retrieve the values missing in the index is more expensive than filtering and sorting

this is way more efficient than sorting and filtering in php

filtering is a lot less expensive than sorting

xml files have none - so sql databases are a lot more efficient with sorting and filtering


features header complicated
glazedlists sorting and filtering features are much more flexible than the one on jxtable

i have seen multiple options like ng-table ui-grid ag-grid kendo-grid.i need features like sorting filtering row styling header column splitting scrolls pagination and also it should be responsive too

you can filtering by adding pagination conditions but sorting is more complicated seeing as photos can have multiple categories

but if you want some header functions in header column like sorting or filtering that is more complicated and you have to implement by your own


tablet	hdpi---------------------------------------------------

folder whats smaller
in your case whats happening is that your galaxy tablet has a lower pixel density and android down-scales the image from a xxhdpi to whatever density the tablet has hdpi or xhdpi ....so it your image is a 512px image android would down-scale it to 341px for xhdpi or 256px for an hdpi device

owing to the fact that the screens density on the tablet is smaller android therefore uses the images in the mdpi folder for the tablet and the slightly bigger ones in the hdpi folder for the phone

each device has a density like hdpi ldpi and mdpi tablet have even more


exponent	addition---------------------------------------------------

mantissa result middle
in the default to-nearest rounding mode the mathematical result of the addition would have to be above the middle point between double.maxvalue and the next floating-point value that could be represented if the exponent range was wider for the floating-point result to round up to infinity

since fp addition shifts the smaller operand s mantissa until both operands have the same exponent you can add a certain magic number to force it

if the exponent are more different than the size of the mantissa then addition or subtraction you get the number with the larger exponent as the result all the bits of the smaller number have shifted off into the bit bucket n + 0 n - 0


mathematica largerexp-smallerexp coefficients
in addition since all my coefficients are positive and i only want the x qth one is there a way to get mathematica to discard all exponent that are larger than that and not do all the multiplication with those

for instance to achieve addition you would scale the larger value to have the same exponent as the smaller one by multiplying it by 10 largerexp-smallerexp then adding the two values and rescaling


powers dividion clearer
so ideally i want to have approximate relative times of elementary operations execution like multiplication typically takes 5 times more time than addition exponent is about 100 multiplication

it will be much slower i don t have benchmarks but i would guess at least an order of magnitude maybe more decimal will not benefit from any hardware acceleration and arithmetic on it will require relatively expensive multiplication division by powers of 10 which is far more expensive than multiplication and dividion by powers of 2 to match the exponent before addition subtraction and to bring the exponent back into range after multiplication division

in addition for doing powers of two bitshifting is usually a little clearer than doing exponent though choose whatever works for you


expression-blend	silverlight---------------------------------------------------

nsurlconnection	nsurlsession---------------------------------------------------

api methods custom
specifically nsurl nsurlrequest and either nsurlconnection or nsurlsession nsurlsession is a newer api and is suggested for use by apple

nsurlsession is newer than nsurlconnection if you are using swift language then you can use your own custom methods by using nsurlsession or you can use alamofire


jspm	npm---------------------------------------------------

strsplit	substr---------------------------------------------------

pull	push---------------------------------------------------

mechanism rebus method
a heartbeat mechanism pull model is definitely easier to implement but a push model is far more efficient

if in-order processing is required a much better design would be to use another message processing library that supports a pull model which i think would fit your scenario much better than rebus push model

using signalr is not a good idea because signalr using push mechanism to notify but it seems in your case some pull method is more suitable and also signalr doesn t support really permanent queue to keep messages in queue while consumers being ready


scalable starters
i have found that pull is more scalable than push

why do you think that push is far more scalable then pull for starters


subscriptions notification answers
as stated by other answers neither push nor pull is better but rather you should pick the one that best fits your design needs

the reason the pull model works better than the push model in this case is as follow

before do git pull and git push it s better to make sure that git status result is contain text working directory clean

if your goal is to eliminate certificate fingerprint warnings during push pull there s a better way to do this

is the performance of pull better than push in this scenario

i guess one of them is that the push model is less coupled then the pull model

pull subscriptions perform much better than push subscriptions in a wan scenario

how are push notification better than pull notification on iphones

bootstrap 4 has moved to a full flexbox model so the push pull utilities are no more


ubuntu	debian---------------------------------------------------

user packages likely
both use debian packages and ubuntu is based on debian but is more user friendly

your average debian or ubuntu user is more likely to be familiar with apt-get than with cpan


familiar commands ntp
anyway for the past year i ve been using fink and apt-get on leopard because i m more familiar with debian ubuntu

reference from here link for ntp commands as i am more familiar with ubuntu debian based commands


better common fedora
these are also kept up-to-date much better than the ubuntu debian repositories

if your default audio subsystem is pulseaudio common for fedora ubuntu debian it is better to properly recompile pyaudio and underlying c library portaudio with pulseaudio support only without jack and other subsystems

you need to control many logging configurations i think the logging agent on ubuntu debian is better choice


wheezy smaller recent
i believe ubuntu is smaller debian wheezy smaller still or even alpine for tiny start point

i m in debian wheezy which is much more recent than ubuntu 10.04


distro gnome xfce
on my debian should be more or less the same on any debian based distro like ubuntu

ubuntu debian with gnome or xfce need more than 50 alpha in its background the alpha value of 128 255 gets the event while 127 255 doesn t


server stable rare
but if your team has ubuntu experience maybe debian would be better choice for server infrastructure if you do not need the bleeding edge set of applications

as for debian being more stable than ubuntu for using as server it can be true in very rare occasions where the package is very obscure


wav	aiff---------------------------------------------------

os add-ons custom
its purpose is to provide developers with powerful and efficient sample stream mp3 mp2 mp1 ogg wav aiff custom generated and more via os codecs and add-ons mod music xm it s3m mod mtm umx mo3 music mp3 ogg compressed mods and recording functions

subtraction	modulo---------------------------------------------------

performance operations slower
i am a bit suspicious of the performance because modulo tends to use division which is slower than your subtraction operations

integer multiplication division and modulo are much slower than integer addition and subtraction


precedence equivalent negative
and keep in mind that the modulo has a higher precedence than addition and subtraction

multiplication division and modulo have the same precedence and they all have higher precedence than addition and subtraction

with regard to implementation it also takes advantage of a bit of a non-obvious property of r precedence rules actually this is true of other languages as well such as c c++ and java namely that unary negative is higher than modulo which is higher than binary subtraction thus the calculation for is equivalent to


perforce	svn---------------------------------------------------

great tools tortoise
make sure you re using a source control system that supports branching and merging i ve had experience with perforce and svn and while perforce is better svn is free

svn works much better when disconnected from the network - with perforce you have to tell the server when you ve done a checkout

the tortoise- svn git merge tools or that of perforce are way better here

while perforce is great svn git are more than ok free and widely supported


org.json	gson---------------------------------------------------

slower better jackson
org.json jackson and gson with gson being 10x slower

quick takeaway of the benchmark jackson performs 5 to 6 times better than org.json and more than twice better than gson

or switch from org.json to something that performs better such as gson or jackson


opencv	emgucv---------------------------------------------------

teamcity	jenkins---------------------------------------------------

subtraction	add---------------------------------------------------

tapestry	wicket---------------------------------------------------

background-color	transparency---------------------------------------------------

border-color border color
still if you don t want the elements background-color to span more 10px because of the transparency border and you do not want to set the border-color to match the background color you can use css content property like this

you just set the div with border-radius so that it is a circle and background-color is the more transparency color in the circle


updatepanel	scriptmanager---------------------------------------------------

gif	bmp---------------------------------------------------

vector map image
i haven t worked with any more than jpg png and gif so there might be some more image types out there that can fit into this function bmp

gif jpeg png bmp are more standard than any vector format where usually adobe has the market

jpg jpeg bmp png webp gif svg js map ico css less scss


x86	mips---------------------------------------------------

output complicated architecture
x86 have more complex instructions than mips

i have studied the x86 assembly and architecture and it appears to be a lot more complicated than mips

the wording in your question seems to suggest you don t care as much that the output is mips but rather you want the output to be less complex than x86


data b emulator
this could include a emulator for a 68000 or mips which are arguably nicer assembly instruction sets than the venerable cisc instruction set of the intel x86 16 32-bit

do any of the other common architectures like arm mips sparc etc have an easier than x86 instruction set

if you have not programmed assembly before i suggest you choose mips since it is easier than x86 and then b looking at how to transfer data with the serial port to begin with since this illustrates memory-mapped i o that is used


pylons	turbogears---------------------------------------------------

opera	safari---------------------------------------------------

ios penultimate esr
for comparison 0.68 usage means this outdated google-chrome release is more popular than the current and previous versions of opera the penultimate version of safari on ios and ie 9 or 10

the downside is that you cannot use it for browsers older than ie11 firefox 31 esr safari 7.1 ios 7 konqueror all versions and opera all versions


browsers newer webkit-based
all my other browsers safari google-chrome and opera have newer javascript versions

on all of the other browsers i ve tried safari opera ie google-chrome it looks much less nice because all of those browsers scroll half a screen at a time

all the webkit-based browsers safari google-chrome and opera should be closer in their rendering to each other than firefox or ie 9 separately

it s way faster on ie but other major browsers firefox google-chrome safari and opera perform better when using a container and then appending it fragment or div

according to w3counter ie6 is used by more people than opera safari and any version of google-chrome


css fireofx better
firefox google-chrome opera and safari all handle it better

fireofx google-chrome safari and opera has better css selectors support compare to ie


kerberos	ntlm---------------------------------------------------

better performance ways
in fact in some ways ntlm is better than kerberos

i understand that kerberos has better performance than ntlm

kerberos could be considered as a better option than ntlm


secure domain credentials
but as i understand it ntlm disallows the more secure kerberos domain credentials if they re available

but since ntlm is less secure than kerberos why isn t it the other way around


png	ico---------------------------------------------------

images gif css
jpg jpeg bmp png webp gif svg js map ico css less scss

because i m new in react and server-side rendering at all i want to know if there are any standard ways to fix this problem - not images only i use images png jpeg jpg ico svg sass less css


queue	fifo---------------------------------------------------

approach better
a fifo queue might be a better approach than recursion as suggested by the wikipedia article on breadth-first search

i have to develop a better queue that works more efficiently than the fifo queue


oncreate	onstart---------------------------------------------------

robocopy	xcopy---------------------------------------------------

better
also robocopy is better than xcopy

xcopy will not be better than robocopy at this


use faster half
at least use xcopy robocopy is even faster

that would theoretically cut the time in half but it seems that robocopy is much faster than xcopy at least for this use so it took way less time

use robocopy it s much more powerful than xcopy


windows tool system
btw this is not essential for this solution for windows 7 and 10 xcopy is superseded by robocopy which is much more performant and powerful

if your batch file only needs to run on windows vista or later you can use robocopy instead which is an even more powerful tool than xcopy and is now built into the operating system


migrate	upgrade---------------------------------------------------

cruisecontrol	teamcity---------------------------------------------------

min	median---------------------------------------------------

first heap array
to find the median and left right you probably want to call it to find the median and then just do the max of the components of the array to the left and the min of the components to the right because you know once the median selection phase is done that all elements to the left of the median will be less than it and to the right will be greater or equal

so after calculating median of first k elements delete the first element directly from heap min or max according to whether it is greater or less than median using pointers and then use heapify at that position


archetypes	dexterity---------------------------------------------------

lisp	scheme---------------------------------------------------

purpose smoother family
scheme is also a good language for that purpose and it is simpler smaller than lisp

racket is closer to scheme than to common lisp but you could dip your toes into the lisp family without the speed bump of the emacs style of development

common lisp has a separate namespace for functions which makes operation like this more verbose than with scheme

if you want to learn lisp paip is a better choice to start with because it will teach you a lot about common lisp and a smallish chunk of scheme

i noted that while in languages like c variable identifiers can only be alphanumberics and underscores common lisp allows many more characters to be used like and at least scheme does

overall common lisp is much more uniform than scheme and more radical language experiments if done at all are usually embedded as a portable library rather than defining a whole new language dialect

because they use a different non-scheme language scheme macros are less powerful than common lisp macros in the almost-formal sense you can do arbitrary compile-time computation with them but it s hairy and convoluted

i think that functional declarative programming haskell scheme lisp etc is more powerful and more abstract than imperative programming and therefore is intrinsically harder to learn

scheme is older than common lisp

in a functional style data and functions tend toward having more in common with each other as in lisp and scheme while offering more flexibility in terms of how functions are actually used

i personally believe that it is not worth the effort because basic is a nearly dead language and there are lots of languages better than basic ocaml haskell common lisp clojure scala scheme go d ...

i don t see why sbcl should be so fast - scheme is a far simpler language than common lisp

i suggest that you start with scheme and then move on to common lisp as scheme is simpler

common lisp of course scheme might be an easier introduction though and easier to get a stable simple common environment

none of this is intended to say that clojure is better than common lisp or scheme

i ve noticed that the common lisp approach is more conservative than the approach scheme has

here is a solution in scheme because i know that better than common lisp and have an interpreter for checking my work

however gambit scheme has smoother access to c c++ code libraries which far outnumber common lisp s libraries

that said it is a scheme which has fewer batteries included as compared to common lisp

this is of course subjective but i think learning common lisp or standard scheme is generally more useful just for the simple fact that you then will not be limited to one compiler

if you decide to use a language that s larger and messier than scheme try common lisp

scheme has fewer libraries than common lisp

on the side of using macros racket has always been more advanced than other scheme and lisp implementations

if you are even older and grew up with scheme or are younger and have read the common lisp hyperspec then you might want to write

if you want to understand lisp you re better off first learning either common lisp or scheme

it s popular it s actively developed it has many libraries offering the features of a modern programming environment and scheme is somewhat simpler not to say better just simpler than common lisp

common lisp is a weakly functional mixed-paradigm language and scheme is more strongly functional but still not pure

scheme is intentionally more compact than common lisp and you ll find that you can learn the language very quickly

do racket macros have more advanced functionality than those found in scheme or common lisp

for sure it s a complication that makes it harder to explain the language to whoever is learning it and that s why scheme is considered a better simpler language for teaching but many expert lispers think that it s a good choice that makes the lisp language a better tool for real problems


syntax-rules possible pattern
is it possible however to implement common lisp s macro system in scheme which is more powerful than syntax-rules using syntax-case

i suspect that the reason people write scheme style macro systems in common lisp is more for the pattern matching than for the hygiene


haskell	ocaml---------------------------------------------------

verbose efficient similar
a lot of people seem to say that writing compilers and other language tools in functional languages such as ocaml and haskell is much more efficient and easier then writing them in imperative languages

go is much more c++ like and low level oriented than c# and c# has only a few functional features while scala allows you to write typical functional code more verbose than ocaml or haskell but similar


ml alice standard
it loses points for being about standard ml when ocaml f# and haskell are seemingly more popular

haskell ml ocaml miranda alice oz erlang twelf coq prolog all demonstrate more rigorous applications of mathematics to programming


programming better functional
ocaml will be easier to learn if you coming from almost any other language this is because haskell is as function as functional languages get and working with mutable random access structures can be a little clunky in haskell

ocaml is closer to c++ because of it s imperative and oo features but i recommend you learn haskell as it is more functional more mindbending and has more resources

overminddl1 if you want to learn functional typed programming something like haskell will teach you better than almost any other language however ocaml will be the best if you want to write to get stuff done

for writing compiler the fore-front functional programming languages haskell ocaml etc... have much more rich library of used cases and examples you might want to explore that.also their community are full of programming language geek that are more than happy to share their experiences

i personally believe that it is not worth the effort because basic is a nearly dead language and there are lots of languages better than basic ocaml haskell common lisp clojure scala scheme go d ...

i would just use ocaml but haskell s syntax is so much better than ocaml s and haskell is pure and has cool features such as type classes


type system holes
keith pointed out that haskell has a more powerful type system but it can also be said that ocaml has a more powerful module system than haskell

i ve heard people complaining about haskell s type system having holes and that agda and ocaml coq are better


knitr	latex---------------------------------------------------

scikit-learn	nltk---------------------------------------------------

thin	unicorn---------------------------------------------------

celadon cedar requests
i m running unicorn which is about 40 faster than thin on celadon cedar

thin and unicorn are significantly faster at servicing requests


width	text-align---------------------------------------------------

greater longest visibility
margin-auto works for elements with a width that is less than the page width in this case the ul is taking the entire width so there is nothing to center text-align center for the ul and display inline-block are the solution in this case

to text-align center the text inside a floated div the width of the width should be greater than the containing element

when i specify text-align center for an element with a width that is greater than the width of the text the text is centered within the content box of the element as expected

but i don t need a perfect width even if the width is wider than the longest word it is ok as i will text-align center to enhance visibility

you just need to use text-align right on the labels with a width that is slightly greater than the label text as the text will be lined up at the extreme right end


line box boxes
if the total width of the inline boxes is less than the width of the line box the direction and text-align properties control how the boxes are distributed inside the line box

when the total width of the inline-level boxes on a line is less than the width of the line box containing them their horizontal distribution within the line box is determined by the text-align property


size element text
when i specify text-align center for an element with a width that is less than the width of the text the text is aligned to the left edge of the content box and overflows the right edge of the content box

the has text-align center so the will be centred if the size of the is less than the width of the


vaadin	wicket---------------------------------------------------

button	checkbox---------------------------------------------------

table visible column
i have a table and it has checkbox what i want is when more than two checkbox are selected my button should be visible and vice versa

the table contains a checkbox column and a button column button column may contains more than 1 button


next value image
initially the value of button is disable because value of button is true so the button is disabled.after selecting the checkbox now the button should be able to click

as image shows below i want to make next button enabled only if more than one checkbox get checked

i can verify that by unchecking the checkbox it does flip the value because i enable disable the next button depending on the myproperty value - i have more than one checkbox btw


select alert box
i have an asp page where the status of a list is approved by selecting checkbox and then pressing approve button however when i select more than one checkbox it throws the error index was out of range

on a button click javascript validation should be if a user select one checkbox it should allow to process further to any script but when user selects more than one checkbox it should prompt that you can select only one check box

here i am retriving data from database and i am doing insert update and delete of data using checkbox.my problem is when i click more than two checkbox than also i am moving to update.php page but what i actually want is that when i click on update button first it will check that only one checkbox is selected from list if not than alert message should display like select only one checkbox

how to restrict user to select not more than 10 asp.net checkbox on button click event if user select more than 10 checkbox then alert box will pop up that you can not select more than 10 checkbox

then you can see a few checkbox and at the bottom there are two button you can also use hyperlinks but button are easier to work with

i have put a button for each row which i want to create on click event for it to get the id of that row and be able to send user to second page to edit that row info but i have problem with checking this multiple button if it were checkbox it was easier

the new project has two job numbers so instead of using the job number text box at the top i need to add option button or checkbox whichever is easier to choose between the two different job numbers for the four groups of information


row need exact
currently i am able to generate checkbox in column what i need is one more column with button same as checkbox in each row

in my project on click of checkbox and add more button i am trying to add one row and on click of remove button remove exact row

if i ticked more than one checkbox only one row is deleted each time i clicked delete button


larger small images
what i d like to do is make the button images slightly larger than the checkbox and have the text checkbox and both button on the same line

in both cases plus minus same except in case where is the small checkbox the button is bigger on width maybe it is related with space for checkbox

now on touch devices the sizes of button and checkbox are much larger whereas you are trying to constrain them to smaller sizes


radio better select
using checkbox to check uncheck is better than radio button

when i did this for a project i found that setting the value of select fields radio button and checkbox necessitated more complex code something along the lines of

when there is more than 1 checkbox s they do not work as a group like radio button such that only one 1 radio button can be selected when there is more than 1

as such creating a radio button rather than checkbox is a better solution

checkbox and radio button were working well earlier

everything is better than a checkbox or a button with autopostback set to true nowadays in year 2011 2012 soon

note that onclick is better supported with checkbox and radio button than is onchange

if you only want one to be checked at a time then radio button would seem a better choice although if you want one or zero at a time then checkbox are fine

actually i found out why using two radio button with same names and different values true and false is better than checkbox

note there may be a way to do this with checkbox but radio button were easier to toggle between

if it s only one colour you want selecting you can use a radio button instead which would be a better idea than a checkbox

i think select elements are even harder than radio button and checkbox i don t think there is a reliable html css only for this

checkbox may be a better fit than button here

side note if you only have one radio button on the page maybe a checkbox would be more appropriate

while the differences may seem insignificant at first the correct usage of radio button and checkbox creates a better user experience because the site behaves in a way they expect

edit since you say you can t add a none option and want to use a checkbox even though i strongly disagree on checkbox where a radio button is more appropriate - a common ui error .

for radio button and checkbox it is better to use change events using .on event handler attachment

anyway as stated by other a radio button would be better you can style it as a checkbox if that s what you need

i would suggest adding some validation to make sure at least one of your checkbox is checked or better still change them to radio button with your default pre-selected

if you want the users to select only one option perhaps a dropdown or radio button list is more suitable rather than checkbox

radio button and checkbox have more than its input area grayed since the background for them consists of more than an input area

essentially radio button are a more semantically correct way of styling a toggle and they can be styling to look like a toggle just like checkbox could too

perhaps checkbox would be better but by using the button and a an extra checked class

well actually you would be better off with checkbox control and you can make it look just like regular button

unlike radio button the user can select more than one checkbox at once or select none of them at all

you want your toggle button to behave more like radio rather than checkbox so why not just convert them all to radio

i have noticed that in your form you are using checkbox where radio button would fit better like for field mobile

i am using icheck plugin to make my checkbox and radio button looks better

i intend to add dynamically fields like text boxes radio button checkbox select boxes on a click of button like add more

one more thing i also want select only one radio button when i have selected more than 2 checkbox


checks implicit active
what i want to do is if a user checks the more than 1 checkbox all radio button must turn into checkbox and users must be able to check more options

i agree that checkbox have more of an implicit true false meaning another point is that for radio button you can force the user to make an active choice by having neither option selected


property values custom
so the values can be mapped with each list now by the property of checkbox you can select more than one checkbox unlike radio button so when such case comes the dropdownlistfor that is being populated on the basis of each checkbox selection now comes in a merged format like on selecting option 1 and option 2 both the list contains all the elements mapped to both further on de-selecting it comes back to unmerged state

so i think a custom checkbox is the better choice here but if you really want to use a button i would use a hidden checkbox field and apply onclick functions to the button to change the value of a hidden checkbox field

you ll want to have multiple radio button each with it s own value to set some property to although this is weird for a yes no you are better off with a checkbox but if you had multiple values this is how radio button work

create a universal analytics tag click the enable overriding settings in this tag checkbox go to more settings custom dimensions click the add custom dimension button enter in the left field the numeric index as obtained via the ga property settings and in the right field your value variable


better exclusion ui
side note the checkbox you have there imply that the user should only be choosing one of them something can t simultaneously be on time and late for instance - radio button would be a better ui choice here

my initial idea was to use radio button for the options because of its exclusion functionality but maybe using checkbox provides a better solution


sse	avx---------------------------------------------------

faster slower routine
i have code that does the same thing but the avx version is considerably slower than the sse version

for small buffers hot in l1d cache avx can copy significantly faster than sse on cpus like haswell where 256b loads stores really do use a 256b data path to l1d cache instead of splitting into two 128b operations

single threaded sse operations are faster than single threaded avx operations

before the avx routine runs all the tests are around 80-130 faster then fpu math as can be seen here after the avx routine runs the sse routines are much slower

as expected the performance got better with both and avx 2 faster than sse 4.2 but when i profiled the code with papi i found out that the total number of misses mainly l1 and l2 increased a lot

so the avx version does indeed appear to faster than the sse version both for the original implementations and the optimised implementations

the question is avx scalar is 2.7x faster than sse when i vectorized it the speed up is 3x matrix size is 128x128 for this question

so congratulations - you can pat yourself on the back your avx routine is indeed about a third faster than the sse routine tested on haswell i7 here

now for sse is clearly faster and for the smaller values it s nearlly as fast as avx

they re good for code-size but often slower than sse avx loops


copy loop multithreading
as one example they utilize floating point extensions sse avx and do better loop unrolling

ironically ancient x86 instruction rep stosq performs much better than sse and avx in terms of memory copy

perhaps a highly optimized and tuned implementation with sse avx multithreading is better for me

microbenchmarks can make sse avx copy-loops look better than they are because doing a copy with the same size and alignment every time avoids branch mispredicts in the startup cleanup code


compiler simd newer
if you have a newer processor with sse or avx extensions then ensure that the compiler is compiling to use these features usually this is done automatically when you set optimizations

and simd math libraries for sse and avx however they seem to be more sse than avx2

sse has precision more comparable to gpu you need float4 or float8 in your kernel such that compiler can produce sse avx which has closer precision to gpu

simd registers like avx and sse could be wider than the processor-l1 interface

when i can use sse3 or avx are then older sse versions as sse2 or mmx available -


matplotlib	chaco---------------------------------------------------

umbraco	dotnetnuke---------------------------------------------------

tinyint	varchar---------------------------------------------------

haskell	sml---------------------------------------------------

tripledes	aes---------------------------------------------------

lzo	snappy---------------------------------------------------

big decompression files
snappy also consistently decompresses 20 + faster than lzo which is a pretty big win if you want it for files you re reading a lot over hadoop

snappy is also significantly faster than lzo for decompression


subtraction	multiplication---------------------------------------------------

sum cheaper scientific
it is also possible to manipulate the inputs so that various parts of the calculation return 0 for addition or subtraction or 1 for multiplication or division to make testing easier but this only gets me so far

multiplication division and modulo have the same precedence and they all have higher precedence than addition and subtraction

indicates that multiplication and division have more precedence than sum and subtraction

multiplication and division operators have higher precedence than addition and subtraction in c++ same as in scientific notation

remember multiplication division and remainder operators are all higher precedence than subtraction

the addition and subtraction are much more than multiplication and division

the term is apparently not an exact measurement as it is clear that a double-precision floating-point operation is going to take longer than a single-precision one and multiplication and division are going to take longer than addition and subtraction

i found it fairly easy to generate addition subtraction and multiplication questions at random however division is more tricky

the intuition would say addition subtraction are faster than multiplication division but is that really correct

in general you ll have more variation with multiplication and division than with addition and subtraction

apart from that multiplication is addition done more than once and division is subtraction done more than once

i don t think they have a natural precedence unlike say multiplication and division being of greater precedence than subtraction and addition because they can be built from subtraction and addition

for floating point operations addition and subtraction are harder than multiplication and division so they may be slower or not again it depends on how much transistor real estate there is dedicated to the fpu

i don t understand why the division multiplication in c++ is so much slower than addition subtraction where the managed c# version is more reasonable to my expectations

multiplication has higher precedence than addition subtraction

integer multiplication division and modulo are much slower than integer addition and subtraction

the operations are always algebraically simple never involving anything more than addition multiplication subtraction division and taking powers

multiplication and division have higher priority than addition and subtraction

to start with i need multiplication and division to take higher precedence than addition and subtraction

multiplication is more expensive than addition subtraction and division is more expensive still

finally we all know that multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction so we can remove the extraneous parentheses so this turns into

subtraction operations and usually significantly faster than multiplication and division

either way your example with the numeric expression would multiplying by 3 first because multiplication has higher precedence than addition or subtraction

i know the basics division and multiplication higher than addition and subtraction but i would have to look up something more esoteric

multiplication and division have a higher precedence than addition and subtraction

typically operations like addition and subtraction are much faster in integer -- multiplication and division less so

division multiplication has higher precedence than addition subtraction and parentheses is required to do addition subtraction before multiplication division

nothing follows the rule of multiplication and division having more precedence over addition and subtraction

this is happening because the concatenation operator has a higher precedence than the addition or subtraction operators but multiplication and division have a higher precedence then concatenation

addition subtraction for the rectangular bound calculation is cheaper than multiplication


ecj	javac---------------------------------------------------

popover	tooltip---------------------------------------------------

installation	upgrade---------------------------------------------------

different new versioning
when you install a msi with abovementioned settings msi will check if any other product installed with same upgrade code if it finds a product then it will check if the new installation has a higher versioning

upgrade code must be the same product code must be different and installation versioning must be larger in either first second or third number


flask	django---------------------------------------------------

task apparent current
current task looks like flask is ok for it since it is smaller and simplier than django

it became apparent that options like flask django would be better suited for the task due to the frameworks


bottle preference faster
either will do the trick but bottle or in my preference flask will be faster as it is much more lightweight than django

i m building an application in both bottle and flask to see which i am more comfortable with as django is too much batteries included

i can think of two relatively straightforward things you can do without ditching php though i have to mention that php doesn t have much to recommend it and you would likely be better off with python django python flask or ruby rails

if you re looking for something less heavy than django perhaps try flask or bottle

in this approach you won t get much from django you are better of with bottle flask


integration first place
now you can get all those same features with flask if you re prepared to do some integration work but the argument can just as easily be made that django is better for beginners precisely because it does come with all those things built-in

but if the use of mongodb is a must then i suggest that you reconsider using django in the first place because mongodb has a better integration with flask through mongoengine


framework smaller great
i would suggest furthering your knowledge of python it s an amazing language so it s gonna be fun and then go back to django or maybe start with a smaller framework like flask which does less magic

flask has a really great albeit smaller than django community and there are a lot of extensions available for common web-app extensions in the extensions directory

if you are looking for a web framework simpler than django look at flask flask uses jinja2 as the default template engine

if you are looking for the latter then flask is a micro framework that is considerably smaller than django


fast-forward	merge---------------------------------------------------

i2c	spi---------------------------------------------------

control data research
on top of that the i2c bus is slower than spi because there are control data exchanged

i have done some research about them and it seems to be that spi is faster than i2c but the last one ensures more control and error detection over the first one


better temperatures error
how is spi better than i2c at these temperatures

might be better off with i2c or spi like people have suggested here

spi or i2c might have better error correction than your customer serial protocol


uart complex slow
i know i2c is more complex slow than spi uart etc. but it s a constrain

communication via i2c is more complex that with uart or spi solution


post faster
post explaining why spi is faster than i2c

i wanted to know that what makes spi faster than i2c


persistent	transient---------------------------------------------------

tablet	mdpi---------------------------------------------------

android images folder
the reason those two really high resolutions exist in mdpi is because they are only used on tablet which have a larger screens size...so the dpi rating works out to still be in the midrange

owing to the fact that the screens density on the tablet is smaller android therefore uses the images in the mdpi folder for the tablet and the slightly bigger ones in the hdpi folder for the phone


portrait	landscape---------------------------------------------------

space lesser fitting
as landscape has lesser space than portrait you are able to view only top scrollview so only that portion would be scrollable

i guess you are able to see the complete layout in portrait just because portrait layout is having more space and your complete layout is fitting well but landscape is having lesser space


mode fine switch
when i draw a 3d cube in opengl es for android it seems to look fine as long as i m in portrait mode but when i switch to landscape it looks more like a diamond

if you switch between portrait and landscape when viewing this on an ipad3 you ll need to refresh the browser window between switches you can see that portrait mode is choppier than landscape

my problem with this is that the calculation works fine in the portrait mode but as soon as i switch to landscape mode the distance between bottom and button is bigger than in portrait mode


width height mode
the following works perfectly with my phone in portrait the width fits but when i flip to landscape the width still fits perfectly but the images are longer than the height

if window height is bigger then window width the we have a portrait or in any other case we have a landscape orientation

the third url works fine when the image width is larger than the height landscape but when the height is the largest dimension portrait it resizes the height correctly but the width dimension does not get padded to fill the 600px width but instead becomes whatever size is calculated to maintain the aspect ratio

or continuously check the stage width height in onenterframe update and if height is bigger than width portrait else landscape

however if you want to redesign your layout or make adjustments based on wether the screen is in landscape width is larger than height or portrait height is larger than width mode you can definitely use css media queries

also your css for .character has the width 170 narrower than the height 245 which would be a portrait view but your example shows a landscape view

then you can write separate css for width less than 650px portrait more than 650 landscape

i have report with width size is bigger than height size like landscape but set to portrait in format - page format ireport

take screenshot of rotated screen and while uploading turn the dimension to portrait if their dimension is landscape i.e width is greater than height

if the height is longer than the width the screen is in portrait mode otherwise it is landscape

such that a landscape image would have an ideal height of 300 or slightly larger with a width 400 and a portrait image would have an ideal width of 400 or slightly larger with a height 300

some images are portrait orientation some are landscape all are larger than the desired render size

you have this issue because height in landscape mode is lower then in portrait

it will adapt the video frame height to landscape mode and it will play the video in the landscape mode whether or not a portrait mode is more suitable

if the height is higher than the width then you can say it s portrait or else landscape

if you resize your browser window to still have a viewport with a with equal or less than 1024px but have an height greater than your width the viewport is no longer considered to be in landscape mode but switch to portrait mode

but the screen always gets rotated to landscape instead of being set to portrait when the width is smaller than the height

in crystal report if i set a user defined size as 4ã 6 it sets the page landscape as height is less than width due to this printer prints page on landscape mode i want it in portrait

this is a conflict on tablet ipad portrait width 768 and mobile phone landscape width 768 but height is smaller around 400 only in which cutting the height of images co z i need to keep the images width 100

it s a bold meaning that its width is greater than its height which makes its portrait view a landscape

one page is a page of which the width is smaller than the height sounds like it s a page in portrait but as there s a rotate value of 90 added to the page dictionary it is shown in landscape

you are using the screen size to generate your placeholder image and the width of the screen in landscape is bigger than portrait

it works as as desired for landscape image width greater than height however for portrait it automatically rotates image and interchange width and height without any flag to get if any rotation has been done

if you think about a moment this is exactly what you want - to know if width is smaller than height portrait the opposite landscape or if they are the same square

its because the height of the screen in portrait mode is more when compared to height of the screen in landscape mode

this gave the uiimageview a portrait size greater height than width even though the app is locked in landscape mode

the program s label changes dynamically so when the width is greater landscape mode it s label has a different text then when the height is greater portrait mode

if you set the width to lower than the portrait width and set the min-width to 100 then you sill get width 100 but this time a version that actually works and now the iframe takes the actual container width and not the landscape width

topbar portrait height is bigger than topbar landscape height everywhere except iphone 6 plus

because in landscape your height is smaller than in portrait you need to have a value smaller than 1.0

so in the case if i upload 2 images i want to check if the images are portrait height is greater the width or landscape and need to show the images accordingly

the bug occurs if the input has a width that makes it wider than the portrait width when in landscape mode

in order to do so you need to find out if the svg is portrait or landscape - meaning if the width is smaller than height former or not latter

to determine whether the image has landscape or portrait format simply check to see if width height is larger or equal to 1

and i want to show the video in the landscape mode if the height is greater then the width of the phone otherwise to show the video in the portrait mode


ones taller nothing
as you can see the bottom two photos landscape so have been rotated are narrower than the portrait ones at the top

i am trying to make all a row of 4 images all have the same height size i already tried to play around with the width and height using css but nothing seems to work the portrait images always end up taller than the landscape ones here s the code


order webview cells
i would recommend to check which of width or height is bigger in order to know if you are in portrait or in landscape and adapt your math to this parameter

you may try to listen to uideviceorientationdidchangenotification within your subclass cell to rotate the webview and within your view controller with the table view and run a -reloaddata on your table view in order to properly resize the cells assuming the landscape webview is way higher than the portrait webview


change orientation view
this demo illustrate the change from landscape to portrait using css orientation when the window height is higher than its width

or the tableview is covering it up because the landscape view has less vertical room than the portrait view

it is quite interesting since you are in portrait view but when keyobard is shown width of the available screen is higher than height and that change orientation to landscape

i have this doubt i have a menu in which i run a javascript code or another depending on whether its width is greater or less than its height works me well the first time the screen resolution is detected but if there is a change of resolution or a change of orientation does not detect it and despite for example of having changed to portrait orientation still executing the landscape orientation code


different matter design
if all you need is a different layout for portrait and landscape there s an easier way to do this

so as stated in the title i have an issue with the different designes between landscape and portrait i have been trying to make landscape look better more like the portrait design but no matter what i do it turns out ugly small imageview and smaller movie details field here is the picture of the looks and the xml code if there is anything that can be done id love to hear you re advice


padrino	ruby-on-rails---------------------------------------------------

faster speed better
sinatra and padrino are not automatically faster than ruby-on-rails

but i don t know anything about sinatra and padrino is the footprint and speed really that better than ruby-on-rails

as wuliwong said sinatra and padrino are way less complex than ruby-on-rails


mouseover	mouseleave---------------------------------------------------

reliable
also you might want to use mouseenter and mouseleave which are sanitized by jquery and are a little more reliable than mouseover and mouseout

imho mouseenter and mouseleave are much more reliable than mouseover and mouseout which tend to flicker


better behaviour work
it should also be noted that mouseenter and mouseleave work somewhat differently and usually much better than mouseover and mouseout

in this case mouseenter mouseleave has better behaviour and prevents bubbling compared to mouseover mouseout


csv	tsv---------------------------------------------------

lxml	beautifulsoup---------------------------------------------------

robust experienced powerful
lxml is significantly more powerful and robust than beautifulsoup in my experienced opinion

i found lxml to be more efficient consistent to use and even robust than beautifulsoup


broken html better
it s much much faster than beautifulsoup and it even handles broken html better than beautifulsoup their claim to fame - lxml just isn t as vocal about it

i would recommend lxml for html parsing it s simple and considerably faster than beautifulsoup can be as much as two orders of magnitude

note that lxml is probably a better option than beautifulsoup for this kind of task nowadays for the reasons given by beautifulsoup s author

beautifulsoup is more suitable for html parsing than lxml

the reason for using lxml for such a task is that it cleans html files better than beautifulsoup do

regarding beautifulsoup lxml is more efficient and in my experience can handle broken html better than beautifulsoup

beautifulsoup is a python package that parses broken html while lxml does so faster but with high quality html xml

i prefer the beautifulsoup syntax as i find it more natural but i find that lxml is better when i m trying to parse unknown quantities on the fly based on variables-- generating xpath strings that include variable values which i will then use to extract specific elements from varying pages


easier xpath pleasant
i think beautifulsoup or even bare lxml would be easier

lxml will let you use xpath here which i think will be less painful than beautifulsoup s interface

lxml enables you to search for elements using xpath which i think is easier than using beautifulsoup s api

i found a solution to this problem using beautifulsoup at beautifulsoup-where-are-you-putting-my-html because i think it is easier than lxml

so if you are just starting out beautifulsoup may be easier to use instantly but in the end i believe lxml is more pleasant to work with


faster parser better
speed isn t important here but in other applications it is good to know that regexes are very fast 100 times faster than lxml and 1000 faster than beautifulsoup

according to some benchmark tests lxml is nearly 100 times faster than beautifulsoup

according to the above posts and my own experience lxml is definitely faster than beautifulsoup

lxml is faster than beautifulsoup i think and has much better functionality while remaining relatively easy to use

how can i find all div and span tags with order preserved.with beautifulsoup it is very simple but i switched recently to lxml since it is much faster than beautifulsoup

one of the things that makes lxml better than beautifulsoup is support for proper css-like class selection or even supports full css selectors if you want to use them

i prefer to use beautifulsoup better than lxml

since you re using lxml why not use it in a more direct manner lxml is believed to be faster than beautifulsoup

it provides similar css selector syntax as jquery does and it s much faster than beautifulsoup because it relies on lxml to do the parsing work

note that using the beautifulsoup parser is a lot slower than lxml s default parser

lxml is also much much faster than beautifulsoup

lxml is supposed to be much faster and efficient and can do much more than beautifulsoup

i ve been trying to do this with beautifulsoup though it looks like lxml might work better

pyquery is based on lxml so it s also much faster than beautifulsoup

it uses lxml underneath and is much faster than beautifulsoup

i ve found that even if lxml is faster than beautifulsoup for documents that size it s usually best to try to reduce the size to a few kb via regex or direct stripping and load that into bs as you are doing now

you ll probably find that lxml runs faster than beautifulsoup but in my uses beautifulsoup was very easy to learn and use and handled typical crappy html as found in the wild well enough that i don t have need for anything else

alternatively you can use lxml module which is lot faster than beautifulsoup

edit don t use this for html work use the lxml library it s python based and much faster than beautifulsoup

from reading this website it seems lxml is the most commonly used and fastest while beautifulsoup is slower but accounts for more errors and variation

sgmlparser has convert_entityref method but instead of deprecated sgmlparser i would recommend using lxml or beautifulsoup which have better parser api

i prefere lxml it s a harder to understand but much faster than beautifulsoup

it s generally accepted that lxml is faster than beautifulsoup ref

lxml is much faster than beautifulsoup and probably the fastest parser available for python


sqoop	hadoop---------------------------------------------------

nginx	lighttpd---------------------------------------------------

faster cherrypy memcached
if you aren t using any of the other features of apache consider using something lighter and faster like lighttpd or nginx

according to these benchmarks it also uses less memory and cpu resources than nginx or lighttpd while running faster

question 1 you can use just one server but for serving static media a solution like lighttpd or nginx will be much faster

nginx seems to be the webserver getting the majority of the buzz lately it may be able to serve faster than lighttpd maybe not

shortly put running some benchmarks on a page doing some database operations and serving static dynamic content has shown that plain cherrypy was twice as fast than nginx and memcached and about half faster than lighttpd


fastcgi perception better
i was also going to recommend nginx + fastcgi as i prefer nginx to lighttpd it s better mantained or at least that s been my perception the last few years

nginx or lighttpd in fastcgi mode use less ram than apache and they can handle more concurrent connections


apache small comfortable
letâ s encrypt provides great scripts for apache 2 and nginx but not lighttpd which is much more comfortable for small systems like raspberry pi or old boxes

using a different server such as one apache and one nginx or one apache and one lighttpd will be much easier because their configuration files don t conflict with each other

just one tip if only job for the http server will be just proxying the play apps consider using some lighter option than apache for an example nginx or lighttpd you ll find sample configurations for all of them in play s documentation


maven	cobertura---------------------------------------------------

job checking ant
also forgot to mention junit testing framework and a great eclipse plugin eclemma for code coverage much better than cobertura ecobertura and easier to use and of course you can try maven as the other post mentionned or try ant as build tool

if you re going to stick with maven and want a plugin for maven that will do the code-coverage job i think cobertura is a better choice as emma stable last build is from 2005

i find cobertura and emma to be largely interchangeable in terms of coverage checking just that cobertura has a better maven plugin and emma has a better eclipse plugin in my opinion


phpunit	simpletest---------------------------------------------------

best opinion easier
i found simpletest was even easier than phpunit to set up

simpletest is slightly easier to grasp but phpunit is the best in my opinion at least so if you want to start learning and using a framework start with the one you re going to use when you ll be a master in tdd

i ve used both phpunit simpletest and i found simpletest to be easier to use


strcpy	malloc---------------------------------------------------

faster strlen cleaner
because of the above replace strdup with strlen malloc memcpy memcpy is slightly faster than strcpy

or indeed if your system has strdup or you re willing to write an implementation then strdup is much cleaner than malloc + strcpy


sortedlist	sorteddictionary---------------------------------------------------

better purpose performance
sorteddictionary offers same advantages than sortedlist but performs better if values to insert are not already sorted

if retrieval by index doesn t happen too often a sortedlist or sorteddictionary will have much better performance characteristics access by index can be achieved through the elementat extension method

for your purpose you would probably be better off with a sorteddictionary class or perhaps sortedlist


removal insertion operations
note after doing some benchmarks i found that sorteddictionary is faster for removal but sortedlist is faster for adding and indexing by key

as zmbq mentioned in his comment to marc s question the sortedlist is implemented as an array so if faster insertion removal times are needed then the sorteddictionary would be a better choice

sorteddictionary has faster insertion and removal operations for unsorted data o logn as opposed to o n for sortedlist

sorteddictionary has faster insertion and removal operations for unsorted data o log n as opposed to o n for sortedlist


faster middle
sortedlist is faster when you want to enumerate the elements and you can access the elements by index and sorteddictionary is faster if there are a lot of elements and you want to insert a new element in the middle of the collection

if the list is populated all at once from sorted data sortedlist is faster than sorteddictionary

sortedlist is faster than sorteddictionary

if the sortedlist is populated all at once from sorted data it s faster than sorteddictionary


memory
sortedlist tkey tvalue uses less memory than sorteddictionary tkey

â sortedlist uses less memory than sorteddictionary

sortedlist uses less memory than sorteddictionary


directx	gdi---------------------------------------------------

faster gdi-based full
to say directx is faster than gdi is also something of a simplification - wpf and gdi-based rendering technologies just have different performance characteristics

speed is usually faster than gdi and slower than directx and depends greatly on how you do things seen something to work 60 times faster after rewriting in a sensible way

directx should be faster than gdi except when you are reading from the frontbuffer which is very slow

directx is in general much faster than gdi due to the fact that it has full acceleration on most video cards

i need to capture screen as fast as it is possible i used to use gdi but it s too slow then i read that using directx will be faster but the time of capturing screen and converting surface to bitmap is approximately same

directx is way faster than gdi


better method getfrontbufferdata
using getfrontbufferdata in directx method is slower than gdi itself

...but i am not sure which method is better such as gdi or directx nor how i would implement said methods


submit	submission---------------------------------------------------

pre-processing function yes
you should treat submit as what happens after you ve done any pre-processing so binding to click events then conditionally raising the submit is better than always submission but conditionally stopping the submit

i think it can be better to do form submission through javascript so on submit function can be controlled more wisely to kill popup on more than one submit click....am i right if yes plz guide this way


data form button
also note that for form submission it is typically better to use the onsubmit event as opposed to the onclick event since forms can technically be submitted by hitting the enter key as well as clicking the submit button

the captcha is generated on load and it s checked by another server script which you can call on clicking the submit button but before actually submission explore more events of form submission

in that case binding to the form submit may be better to prevent other means of submission the form which cricumvent the button click

i suspect this will submit the right form data but may not be acceptable if your button is calling js and is doing more than submission form data


hide	show---------------------------------------------------

div scrolltop simple
when scrolltop is less than 300 show the div otherwise hide it

what i want to do is to make my hide show div have more simple script


logic operation complicated
this allows me to show or hide or do more complex operation with what s on each tab simply by calling the array of shapes

while widget logic can help you do much more than hide or show a widget to logged in logged out users

if your hide show logic becomes more complicated you can move it into a method on your controller


content tabs script
js for tabs generally does no more than show hide maybe load content

then let us create a script that when see more is clicked it will hide this see more and would show the content inside


reliable solid hand
on the other hand show hide is more reliable

just using jquery show and hide will provide a more solid reliable result


better easier button
more importantly i think show and hide will be simpler and the fight against complexity is paramount

but for the record using detach and attach instead of hide and show would be slightly better memory-wise because those two methods allow for the view hierarchy of unused fragments to be destroyed

after some additional thought here s how i solved the problem but i d like to know if there s a better way than toggling show hide w different status messages at certain points in my code

so if it s greater than 0 show the button otherwise hide it

by the way the code with show hide is also more readable

to achieve this you can consider instead of storing the state in an array to make use of .data to store the state show or hide is much easier to maintain and understand

as a note and for a shorter code using the css display none and jquery show milliseconds and hide milliseconds is quicker you can even animate it by using time like this

since you want more of a show hide button i think a better experience is to have a checkbox that indicates what state you re going to set it to instead of relying on the first item

in my opinion using jquery show hide is a better solution at this point in time

since we are dealing with images and changing them on change of select i would prefer changing the src of image rather than using show hide method.it is more simpler

also as mentioned elsewhere show is a better option to css visibility as hide sets display none and not visibility

because you can created very targeted css show hide could be easier round corners and adding text for accessibility will be easier etc

purpose of having individual svg for each bullet chart is to make their management show hide remove easier

i think having each permutation in their own container that you hide show is the better solution

better than hide and show

now what i have to do is to hide discover more button when there are no more images to show

it can be even shorter with show and hide

for a simple image toggle you might have an easier time with a hide show style instead

show less will be hide and load more button will be show .thanks

in my experience hide and show is a better approach because it doesn t mess with the dom

ok guys i cant find better solution with show hide or something so i added snippet to be more easy if someone find solution why when back to top opacity still 0 i need when back to top opacity to be 1

how can i show and hide button read more with jquery

using show and hide should prove more robust and simpler too

my thought is javascript show hide option is better for usability and the customers journey especially on mobiles

is there a better way than show hide that would be easier on the memory performance

but i don t know how to align the imageview and the textview to be easier to hide show just the imageview when needed

use hide and show will be better for you

show hide gives the better results but the selected thumbnail remains the previous displayed panel.

i would use addclass removeclass instead of show hide to get better control

if you just want to hide the options and then selectivly show them hide and show are better options

not show from start is better than show and then hide

this method is more general than show hide as it can be extended to any style rule

also the show and hide functions are easier than animating the opacity

is there a better function than show hide which looks as nice as the accordion does


faster icons progress
problem is that although both datagridview filling and updating a progressbar goes from same loop in steps by 100 filling of datagridview ends much faster than progressbar show a progress and hide it on about 50

i was wondering if creating the icons prior to the click and using show hide would be faster

take into account than show hide operatoins are much faster than add delete

i d bet show and hide will be faster

the hide show variant is much faster

it would be great if someone can point me to a document for some javascript guide for better performance use hide show is faster than insert delete a dom

i suppose it is because you hide them faster than you show them so for a slight second the overal page height is shorter than it should


element event button
then you can use the itemcheckedchanged event which will get triggered when an item is checked and here you can see how many items are currently checked and if more than one show the element with the text and hide the tokens

you can of course improve it for instance using a proper callback rather than an inline event and do more with it show hide the play button but this is it in its simplest form

i had a situation where i needed to do more than just show or hide the one element

my question is how to show hide read more button properly when 8 items texts already fill 250px div but i actually have 9 items so it should show read more button but since it only has 9 items the read more button won t show.

simply call .slideup to hide element and .sidedown to show element read more on the jquery effect


bar higher action
to hide action bar invoke hide method using getsupportactionbar getactionbar in case of minsdkversion is 11 or higher as show below

you can hide show the status bar on android 4.1 api level 16 and higher by using hide show functionality


imagemagick	graphicsmagick---------------------------------------------------

conversion file years
after trying both and finding that imagemagick was better but in the end i choose neither and went with graphicsmagick instead

i do know imagemagick better than graphicsmagick

also changing your imagemagick install from a 16bit one to a 8bit may improve speed as i belive that is one reason graphicsmagick is faster

the origin server would get the images from s3 process them using graphicsmagick since it s much faster than imagemagick then serve them

graphicsmagick also seems to be faster than imagemagick using better multitasking

using imagemagick or graphicsmagick would be better idea but if you really want to use sips you could try to remove transparency by converting image to bmp and then back to png again

for me graphicsmagick is performing far better than imagemagick

graphicsmagick is not that much faster -- and the outputted file sizes are significantly higher than imagemagick

graphicsmagick is a fork of imagemagick that is faster and has fewer bugs this is what flickr uses internally so it should be good enough for you

i keep hearing from some people that graphicsmagick a fork from quite a few years back that branched off from imagemagick is significantly faster than imagemagick

graphicsmagick converted much faster than imagemagick although i did not test conversion with cuda processing


multiplying	division---------------------------------------------------

performance dshin jit
i presume that you know that using a division is a lot slower than multiplying by decimal number 5 is always slower than 0.2

note that i ve incorporated dshin s comment that multiplying is faster than division however the performance improvement is about 90 removing the binary search 10 multiplication vs

i believe that division would be faster than multiplying by the inverse since the inverse has to be calculated first then multiplication performed

sure that s probably compiled or jit d away but you should avoid division in performance critical code it s far slower than multiplying


b left-shift operator
according to agner s instruction tables a single fp division is slower than a single reciprocal op and a single multiplying op

these can be compared to multiplying by 2 x left-shift or divinding by 2 x right-shift but it should be noted that a binary shift is much faster than a division operation

division of quaternion a by quaternion b is nothing more than multiplying a by the multiplicative inverse of b

my question i would rather not use the multiplying operator as multiplicative division operators are slower to execute on my target


mergesort	timsort---------------------------------------------------

mp3	ogg---------------------------------------------------

wav stream mp2
its purpose is to provide developers with powerful and efficient sample stream mp3 mp2 mp1 ogg wav aiff custom generated and more via os codecs and add-ons mod music xm it s3m mod mtm umx mo3 music mp3 ogg compressed mods and recording functions

bass is an audio library to provide developers with powerful and efficient sample stream mp3 mp2 mp1 ogg wav aiff custom generated and more via add-ons mod music xm it s3m mod mtm umx mo3 music mp3 ogg compressed mods and recording functions

its purpose is to provide developers with powerful and efficient sample stream mp3 mp2 mp1 ogg wav aiff custom generated and more via add-ons mod music xm it s3m mod mtm umx mo3 music mp3 ogg compressed mods and recording functions

it is a high level 2d and 3d cross platform windows mac os x linux sound engine and audio library which plays wav mp3 ogg flac mod xm it s3m and more file formats and is usable in c++ and all .net languages c# visualbasic.net etc


things icecast broadcast
in general ogg achieves better compression than mp3 which is a plus for things like download size bandwidth resource usage etc

first of all i recommend you to use ogg instead of mp3 has better performance

if mp3 ogg is better try different compression ratios and sample rates to see which goes faster

if you want to cover the largest audience possible set up a streaming server like icecast and broadcast over mp3 and or ogg both is better

moreover ogg vorbis is better then mp3 at all bitrates

firefox doesn t support mp3 on html5 they support ogg which is better anyway


quality files bitrate
mp3 files were of higher bitrate and when converted to ogg ended up in the loss of quality which resulted in the noise

ogg vorbis is better quality per meg than mp3 plus no licensing legal issues


gson	jackson---------------------------------------------------

faster json slower
personally i prefer jackson as according to test benchmarks it s faster than gson

according to the performance results at for serialization with databind with strings gson.tojson myobject gson is over 10x slower than jackson

all in all jackson is considered to be faster but i ve also read that gson gives better performance when working with large objects

under some conditions gson has proven to be a lot faster than jackson there also exists jsonp and json.simple

i looked at gson metrics and it seems slower than jackson

i heard about jackson and gson they are better than json.simple

gson and jackson are better to use

very small object google gson performs faster than jackson and simple json

actually genson is faster and has more features than gson and has performances close to jackson but its a lot more lightweight see

gson is very easy to use while jackson has better performance

also please suggest me an open source json binder better than gson could be jackson json genson or if any other which could help me to develop fully fledged application in which application continuously hit to restful services and receives the response from the same

quick takeaway of the benchmark jackson performs 5 to 6 times better than org.json and more than twice better than gson

i ve seen questions like this come up before and the general consensus is that jackson is much faster than gson

aside if milliseconds make a big difference look at the stream parses that both jackson and gson provide for faster raw acess but you will be in charge of parsing logic and rebuilding your objects which may be a net loss

or switch from org.json to something that performs better such as gson or jackson

take a look at the jackson json parser it s faster than the one in android and faster than gson and supports streaming

in my case i found jackson little faster than gson i used default serialization because so far i don t have a need to customize serialization

note that other libraries like gson and jackson have much better abstractions for json arrays and objects jsonarray arraynode

jackson type safety is way better than gson

i found jackson better than gson performance project activity better docs ...

further more gson really seems to be faster than jackson json

jackson is more suitable if you have a complex deep json tree because gson creates a lot of temporary objects which leads to stop the world gcs

jackson is faster but the api is 37x more complex than the gson api

we plan to use gson extensively in the application as it seems safer and better than jackson

large objects google gson performs faster than jackson and simple json

deserialization performance is similar with gson over 9x slower than jackson and fastjson about 0.5 faster than jackson

you can parse it like what you are using or you can do the same with more less code and more performance by using gson as described in this answer or you can use jackson as described here

gson 1.6 now includes a low-level streaming api and a new parser which is actually faster than jackson

i m using gson for the parsing and i know jackson might give me better results

gson is simpler jackson is faster

org.json jackson and gson with gson being 10x slower

also it seems jackson lib has better performance than other packages such as gson which i haven t tried personally

gson is faster with smaller documents and jackson is faster with large documents

code looks correct and even at its worst jackson should be no slower than gson

also i want to know if google gson is better than jackson for json parsing

performance of jackson is better than gson


internet diffrent neighborhood
after searched in google found that jackson has better performance than gson i plan to replace gson with jackson in my project but i got a diffrent result when run test code

multiple posts on the internet point toward jackson as having better parsing performance than gson granting somewhere in the neighborhood of 20-30 speed improvement


popular alternative likely
choose a json parser to use in your application most likely it would be gson or jackson others are much less popular

gson is a popular choice for solving this problem however we find jackson to be more performant since it supports alternative ways of processing json streaming in-memory tree model and traditional json-pojo data binding


fgetc	fread---------------------------------------------------

requirement loop things
doing things like 1000 successive fgetc is much slower than doing one single fread of 1000 bytes

there is no requirement that fgetc be any slower at retrieving a block of bytes than fread

the fgetc loop variant was consistently 45x slower than the fread loop


realloc	calloc---------------------------------------------------

doc	rtf---------------------------------------------------

files docx format
i can help you for docx files rtf files are easier and doc files are quite the same as docx but less well organised

if the latter is what you want you could use rtf which is somewhat easier than the doc format


inherited	subclassing---------------------------------------------------

method data useful
inherited is more useful when a new subclassing wants to change the way a method works if you just need to change the data the class uses to work probably an approach like this would do the trick

the tostring method is inherited from object but can be overridden in a subclassing to get more meaningful output


behavior stock functions
i generally use interfaces are too enforce a common behavior that a group of classes share whereas subclassing is more appropriately used in cases where you can achieve serious code re-use through inherited functions properties

usually i subclassing the stock cocoa classes customize to my needs and if i need custom methods in more than one subclassing i will declare a category on the superclass rather than relying on inherited to provide my custom behavior


visibility order wider
it not subclassing because subclassing inherited properties of superclass and add some more

i don t see any straight way to restrict subclassing from choosing a wider visibility for inherited members

similarly as the subclassing gains more methods it inherited the list of superclass in the order in which they were named that precede it

still you cannot inherited from a as superclass cannot have a lower visibility than subclassing

on the contrary since a subclassing inherited all public methods of its superclass the subclassing are definitely bigger


class better base
if a subclassing needs more information than the standard parameters which came up for us you have the option of a second parameters class type that you use as a second parameter but then you have two types of constructors in the tree or using inherited in the parameters class hierarchy

if i have a bunch of fields in a parent class that all need to be inherited by subclassing is it better to have the subclassing nested in the superclass make the fields protected rather than private or use protected accessor

since ireadwrite implements ireadonly ireadwrite is said to be a subclassing of ireadonly although subclassing is more accurately used to describe a class which inherited a base class rather then implements an interface--for the sake of simplicity they are very nearly the same concept

creating the views with code only i think one is better off with subclassing if it comes to more than one level of inherited or many ancestor classes for just one base view

perhaps the class should be decomposed in other classes or subclassing if in your case inherited is more valuable than composition so every class has a well defined responsibility in the system

with subclassing is trickier because any private members of a class are not inherited by the subclassing but protected and public are

depending on how your application is structured this means you may want to have your own base class implementing iresource which creates your custom not found resource for all of its subclassing or better make a wrapper since composition is better than inherited


mayavi	matplotlib---------------------------------------------------

past performance patches
anyway if you re willing to do advanced 3d stuff mayavi is way better than matplotlib

you could do this in matplotlib probably using patch objects to build up a cube and colour the patches as needed however for 3d plotting mayavi is generally easier better

personally i ve used mayavi in the past and found the performance much better than matplotlib for 3d scatter plotting though the python bindings are somewhat in question moving forward i think


nullpointerexception	runtimeexception---------------------------------------------------

nerdtree	netrw---------------------------------------------------

easy default help
in the netrw plugin it would be easy but this one is not used any more as nerdtree just replaced it

however vim comes by default with another plugin which does a lot more than nerdtree called netrw help netrw


django	web2py---------------------------------------------------

conveniences newer environment
i prefer web2py because there are more conveniences built into the environment than offered by django but web2py is much newer than django and hindsight always makes it easier make new implementations better

plus moving from a php mvc framework to web2py or even django would make things easier


purpose turbo gears
as i understand it web2py supports gae better out of the box than django

we thought of django but we think that is very big for our purpose and we decided that webpy or web2py is a better option

django turbo gears web2py which is better for what

to avoid misunderstandings my question is not whether web2py or django is better

django is also a wonderful framework but web2py is just better in my limited experience opinion

anything django does web2py does better

django s admin is better and more customizable than web2py s appadmin

django s is better web2py s appadmin is for administrators only

i think you ll find that web2py is even easier to learn and use than rails and django


fgets	getline---------------------------------------------------

latter things former
you should use getline instead of fgets to make things easier

your code is trying to do the former but you probably meant to do the latter in which case getline may be easier to use than mucking about with fgets


read example line
since i provided a getline example above your read loop can be much better written with fgets as follows

while this is fine in some cases where flexibility is needed reading a line at a time with getline of fgets is the better choice


mouseup	mousedown---------------------------------------------------

event reliable page
more over it is better to track buttons on event itself see this question for more details as mouseup mousedown event might be triggered outside of the page effectively getting you cached state out of sync

edit rereading that page it d been a while it looks like mousedown and mouseup are even more reliable than contextmenu although all major browsers trigger contextmenu


faster better
is there any reason mousedown should be inherently faster better than mouseup

first off consider whether you really want to override mousedown or whether overriding mouseup might be a better option


cvs	svn---------------------------------------------------

aspects enviroment project
svn was supposed to be better than cvs but in some areas that didn t work well

if you use svn then it still okay because svn handles binary files much better than cvs

i can only guess at the reasons and i don t worry much about the occasional downvote but perhaps some readers think i m advocating cvs as a better system than svn or git

that being said i think svn is better in every other respect and you probably shouldn t start a new project with cvs

git and mercurial both handle this more easily that you re imagining and easier than say svn or cvs do

for all the reasons linked in the comment and elsewhere svn tends to be a much better enviroment than cvs or vss unless you have some weird requirements - so if you can successfully import your history and save the company money i wouldn t see why the bosses wouldn t go for it

svn is much better then cvs and git or mercurial are even better again

i need to prove that git is better than cvs and svn to my team.the only thing git lack is a standard server

so what is with svn that your company dislikes so much and cvs does better

svn is better than cvs because it was designed to be - it s roughly the same thing with some simplications and new features

svn in much better than cvs and have lot of mature tools for every platform

many say that svn was build to be a better cvs and in almost all aspects svn is better and is widely used

i donâ t like using git itself though itâ s far better than svn or cvs but github is such an awesome site that iâ ve considered switching just to use it

svn is better than cvs


part use branches
managing changes that need to be made across these branches is a lot easier with svn than it was with cvs but it s by no means pain-free

part of the point of svn was to make the use of branches and merging much easier than in cvs


jython	pypy---------------------------------------------------

unpredictableâ faster benchmark
here is a recent benchmark of jython 2.5.2 running on jvm 7 where jython is slower than pypy but faster than cpython

jython is more unpredictableâ sometimes almost as fast as pypy sometimes much slower than cpython


outputstream	inputstream---------------------------------------------------

nsmutablestring	nsstring---------------------------------------------------

build.gradle	gradlew---------------------------------------------------

background-image	background-position---------------------------------------------------

move	drag---------------------------------------------------

table smaller order
it ends up in a state of confusion...you basically cannot release the drag of the table it keeps getting bigger and smaller as you move your mouse - but you can never let go and release it to get the size you want

but if he move the mouse cursor away from the slider while he is still dragging the slider s thumb the drag speed is lower

i reimplemented the mouse move press and release events for the inner widget in order to be able to move it inside its bigger parent with drag drop


cpu	affinity---------------------------------------------------

single performance time
but i found if i do not set their cpu affinity that is they run on same core 0 the time performance get better than setting cpu affinity 8.76s vs 14.66s

cpu affinity it s better for the cpu to have a load average of 1.0 and processes to have affinity to a single core


filewriter	bufferedwriter---------------------------------------------------

onchange	onkeyup---------------------------------------------------

quicksort	radix-sort---------------------------------------------------

content-length	content-type---------------------------------------------------

lxml	libxml2---------------------------------------------------

nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception---------------------------------------------------

disclaimer idiomatic
disclaimer all this would be needed just to throw an illegalargumentexception which is less idiomatic than a nullpointerexception

arguably throwing a nullpointerexception would be more idiomatic than throwing an illegalargumentexception though


gif	png---------------------------------------------------

jpeg size data
this properly means if the file is an image of gif or jpeg or png and is less than that size

i used gif because its file size 2.1kb was considerably less than png or jpeg in this case

gif jpeg png bmp are more standard than any vector format where usually adobe has the market

gif jpeg and png are more complex - the data is compressed


larger good limitations
it will always be a web format which basically comes down to jpg png and gif with gif being very unlikely because of its limitations gif can contain 256 colors at most and is generally larger than png

just press save and give it a name and that photoshop image will be saved into a transparent background png file which presents more colors and it s smaller than a gif file and is as good as a jpg

if you find png files are larger than the equivalent gif files then you re saving the png in 24 bit color and the gif in palette mode because a gif is always in palette mode


use faster alos
use png or gif it s faster types of images

also if i change all to png is not bigger and alos i am using prawn pdf outputting these images so cant use gif


smaller larger files
if your png files are coming out larger than equivalent gif files it is almost certainly because your source image has more than 256 colors

now i want to show an error message when the image isn t a png jpg or gif or is larger than 250k

gif is smaller because it s based on an colour palette of 256 colours rather than the separate rgb values for each pixel or group of pixels in jpg and png

convert it to png 10-30 smaller than gif on average

reduce image resolutions to the bare minimum and experiment with file formats gif or png might be significantly smaller than jpeg for some images cartoons logos icons but much larger for others photos gradients

but keep in mind that the gif color palette is way smaller than png

if png isn t smaller than gif then your software may be saving it poorly - look for png optimisation progams like pngout and pngnq

after pressing it about twice there is a smaller and smaller delay between the gif being set and the png being set

png has a wider color pallete than gif and gif is properitary while png is not

jpg and png work well for most applications but the files will be larger than gif for very simple graphics

since that appears to generate index-color gif files which are smaller than the png files that doxygen generates

icon size indexed png is often smaller than the same gif

i m not sure if this matters but the gif is significantly larger than the png files

png files have a larger default pallet however you can shrink their color pallet so that when you do they result in a smaller file size than gif

one thing to note is that gif supports a smaller palette than png - only up to 256 colors

it might help to reduce your gif file sizes smaller oh and i believe -depth 8 can only be used for png images

indexed png less than 256 colors is actually always smaller than gif so i use that most of the time


imagepng opaque regard
but in that regard it is replaced by png which is generally smaller supports alpha transparency where gif pixels are either fully transparent or fully opaque and most importantly gif images are limited to 256 colors

you can then use imagecopy to insert each gif image including the background and imagepng to generate png output which is better for line art than jpeg offers better compression than gif and can support more than 256 colors


base64 likely strings
but in my search i found that png images return shorter base64 strings than gif images

note that if you convert your png files to gif images they are likely to look uglier as gif files can only have 256 colors and do not support alpha-transparency


better choices size
png is a newer format and often better than either jpeg of gif - especially for screenshots

choose the correct type of image extension sometimes gif or png delivers better results then jpg s

png does everything except animations unless enhanced with apng that gif does and better

compared to gif png offers better compression larger pallette and more features including transparency

png and gif are better at compressing certain types of images basically blocky graphics while jpeg are better for photo-like images

for example png has better support for transparency than gif or jpeg

so looks like gif and png are better choices although jpg still gets you under the 300 bytes mark

for example given gif may be deprecated in a system because png has proven better for the system s users - perhaps because it supports better colour depth preserving the colours more accurately or svg might be deprecated because some clients have been found to be using web browsers that won t display them jpeg might be deprecated because it s known the images in the system aren t natural photographic images and the format gives visually poor results despite larger compressed files slower processing speed and higher memory usage - lots of possible motivations for making things deprecated

png gif works much better

for storing line drawings text and iconic graphics at a smaller file size png or even gif are better choices because they are lossless

jpeg is bad at that kind of thing and you ll probably find png to compress better probably better than gif too

png and gif are better than jpeg gif probably better than png

i wasn t aware that png should be any worse in terms of file size than gif

while png is definitely better that gif occasionally there is a use case for needing to stay in gif format

there might be some edge cases where gif is slightly better because the png format may have a slightly larger overhead from metadata but it s really not worth the worry

for storing line drawings text and iconic graphics at a smaller file size gif or png are better choices because they are lossless

since you don t need animation and want to stay with loss-less compression you would get somewhat better compression with png instead of gif and png is patent-free

animated png is better than gif if we re focused on file size â achieving a smaller file size was one of the reasons the apng format was designed

png images are always compressed lossless but their compression algorithm works better than competition gif

png gives you better alpha result than gif

according to wikipedia the png format provides better compression than gif

in your implementation of the converter i would use the imagetools library to convert between gif and png png will be better quality than jpeg

many people don t know about 8-bit png which is usually better than gif in size.

png compresses much better than gif and allows more colors at the same time


compression better animation
png is capable of every image mode of gif apart from animation and when using the same image mode png will have better compression due to its superior deflate algorithm compared to lzw

as a general rule png is never worse and often better than gif because of superior compression


format lighter capable
the gif format is substantially less capable than png

is jpeg format lighter than png or gif


width lower script
so this script will take a jpg gif of png image resize it to 110px width if width is greater of 110px height if height is greater

i haven t worked with any more than jpg png and gif so there might be some more image types out there that can fit into this function bmp

the image is outputted correctly but both the gif and png are considerably lower quality


uiview	cashapelayer---------------------------------------------------

vim	gedit---------------------------------------------------

uiview	calayer---------------------------------------------------

better worse performance
i noticed calayer had worse performance than uiview

is calayer better than uiview in terms of performance


filesystems	ntfs---------------------------------------------------

not-so-well complicated performance
generally the performance of hard filesystems like ntfs is better than that of traditional unix filesystems

it s not too hard for the fat filesystems as it s quite simple and well documented but it s more difficult for ntfs as the filesystems is much more complicated and not-so-well documented

quicksort	insertion-sort---------------------------------------------------

time-efficient faster linkedlist
it seems that when sorting insertion-sort would be more time-efficient then quicksort when sorting a linkedlist

i think that insertion-sort would be much faster then quicksort when sorting a linkedlist


laravel	yii---------------------------------------------------

profiling	benchmarking---------------------------------------------------

jqgrid	datatables---------------------------------------------------

customisation someone better
it turns out jquery datatables is better suited for customisation and we have adopted this instead of using jqgrid

if you don t have someone around to help with jqgrid you are better off with datatables


jscrollpane	jinternalframe---------------------------------------------------

height jlabel bigger
specifically jscrollpane have height bigger than jinternalframe

my problem is this i don t want the jlabel or the jscrollpane to stretch to the size of the jinternalframe if the jlabel is smaller than the jinternalframe


ffmpeg	libav---------------------------------------------------

union	distinct---------------------------------------------------

first different set
so union is much better than the union all with distinct in performance-wise

union all will perform better than union when you re not concerned about eliminating duplicate records because you re avoiding an expensive distinct sort operation

the union can result in better performing subqueries which makes up for the increased computation for removing distinct values

i don t think you can do much better than 3 union maybe the last 2 can be combined with count distinct

the union all with a distinct gives better performance though i believe..

union all performs better than union union works like distinct first order by then remove duplicates

union all is better than union because it avoids a sort you know you ll get a distinct set because you re joining on two different tables


check faster slower
that s one reason why omitting distinct and replacing union by union all is much faster

union all is faster than union distinct

i have experienced situations where union s made a query much slower than union all with a distinct afterwards

using union all is quicker than using union since a distinct check does not need to be done

union is a shorter way to write union distinct

the union distinct would be faster if each clause can use the index and there are relatively few rows returned

union all is generally faster than using distinct or grouping

the union might be slower due to it attempting to get the distinct values

i am currently using union all and a distinct in the outer query as this proved much faster than using union s for the uniqueness of data

you can avoid duplicates and still run much faster than union distinct which is actually same as union by running query like this

union distinct is slower than union all but you may need it for de-dupping.

a side note since you want all rows using union all is faster since it does not need to perform a distinct to eliminate duplicates

the difference is that union all is faster than union due to the fact that union eliminates duplicates from the resultset by using select distinct

in most cases union all is slightly faster than union distinct

union forces a distinct to occur and there s little slower than distinct

you can avoid duplicates using union all and still run much faster than union distinct which is actually same as union by running a query like this

however the tables are huge and the union all i read its faster than distinct takes forever to execute even with just two tables let alone 6

keep in mind that union will return a distinct list - duplicates will be removed but it will perform slower than using union all which will not remove duplicates


sproutcore	cappuccino---------------------------------------------------

data use api
sproutcore makes use of bindings better than cappuccino currently does

sproutcore has a better data store api than the one cappuccino has


qlist	qvector---------------------------------------------------

heap faster pointers
if it stores it as pointers on the heap won t qlist be much worse off than qvector

operations like prepend and insert are usually faster than with qvector because of the way qlist stores its items in memory see algorithmic complexity for details and its index-based api is more convenient than qlinkedlist s iterator-based api

qvector will usually give better performance than qlist because qvector always stores its items sequentially in memory where qlist will allocate its items on the heap unless sizeof t sizeof void and t has been declared to be either a q_movable_type or a q_primitive_type using q_declare_typeinfo


pointer efficient words
size qlist performs better than qvector because it doesn t store the

which brings me to the point - if transaction ids are per savings account they would be sequential in other words you will be better off with the qlist or even better a qvector because it will be a little more efficient since you will only be appending transactions

if the size of the qlist s element type is greater than the pointer s size qlist performs better than qvector because it doesn t store the objects sequentially but stores sequentially pointers to heap copies

give better performance than qlist because qvector always

qvector is better than qlist in this case because it s easy to resize it

most often qvector is not the best container to use usually qlist is much better


selenium	appium---------------------------------------------------

debian	centos---------------------------------------------------

silex	slim---------------------------------------------------

bokeh	matplotlib---------------------------------------------------

jruby	rubinius---------------------------------------------------

anemone slower extent
you can try using anemone with rubinius or jruby which are much faster with but i m not sure the extent of compatibility

again we see the pattern of it getting faster during the first two runs after which it settles somewhere in between slightly faster than yarv and the other jruby and slightly slower than rubinius


application efficiency choices
for longer-running applications like a web application rubinius or jruby will generally perform better than mri

works on some rubies better than others jruby and rubinius are recommended efficiency on mri is decreased due to gvl global vm lock

in practice this means that deploying a rails app to jruby is a good idea as is running your integration tests but for developer unit tests and scripts mri yarv or rubinius are better choices


base	fractions---------------------------------------------------

put	get---------------------------------------------------

file command large
as i am benchmarking my cluster i discover that for large file my get command is actually slower than put command

if you need to do anything more complex than put file or get file take a look at edtftpj free


loop small counter
as long as the dataframe is small your assumption that the put process is faster than the get seems true we can fetch all 5 items within one loop of while not q.empty

when i put my loop counter variable pagessent in the watch window it gets optmized when i declare as volatile it still gets optimized but when the max value is set to 4 the loop exits properly but if max value is higher than 4 get stuck..


number series highter
if you are uncertain you can always put an if statement and check if the number you get back is highter then int.maxvalue

from the count you will get the number of sequence and those which have more than 2 put those in a different series and then add that series in the dataframe


better map folder
you need to put all of your code in your get do block or better in a helper file module

if you will only use put remove get it s better to choose map

right now i would have to say the put method is better since it works and i could not get the webservice to work

is that better than just get the .js already compiled and put it on vendor folder


likely lower itâ
if you put -c lower than 80 itâ s going to make it less likely that you get

with get and put it is more likely that the media-types are symmetric however that is not a hard rule


data post form
how can i get rid of the post put data getting exponentially bigger

data should be in post or get.if you dont put your data in your form then you will have to use get which is less secure than post

since most data-storage mechanisms in-ram in a database etc. get a lot slower as you put more data in them you should ensure you re only timing your http access and not looking at overall crawler throughput including storage


time entries precis
i m currently in school and usually spend my time here on stackoverflow looking for answers to homework this time i d thought that perhaps i ll put my code here and maybe i ll get help more precis and quicker

first thing that came to mind was that it was caused of too many entries in the hashmap which caused every put and every get to be slower every time


height width element
to put this in perspective the current project i am working on involves comparing the width and height of an image to get a number to determine if the width is longer than the height or the same

and i m just having trouble saying if the image original file s width is greater than the height then we need the height to expand to the height of the surrounding element and put the width at auto so it doesn t get squished but keeping in mind that the client can upload any image size they want with no restrictions of must be 350x350


greater argument vc
but i get compiler warning c4309 truncation of constant value in vc++ 2010 whenever the argument to put is greater than 0x7f

the reason why you get the exception mentioned is because when you call byte.parse but the string that you put in is greater than 255


faster calls quicker
as i understand hazelcast put and get may work much faster if it was not inside actor

you ll get it done much faster by just looking at the sample project i put together

that it would perform quicker with get put calls

for some years now i ve just stuck to the thought that since directbytebuffer s are a direct memory mapping at os level that it would perform quicker with get put calls than heapbytebuffer s

on the one hand we can say let s put 20 threads and get it done faster

at times the get rate is slower than the put rate and we see messages backing up

this could mean that put is now slower than get and we have to wait


requests second bucket
i m not sure if this is the answer but states that if you expect a rapid increase in the request rate for a bucket to more than 300 put list delete requests per second or more than 800 get requests per second we recommend that you open a support case to prepare for the workload and avoid any temporary limits on your request rate

if you expect a rapid increase in the request rate for a bucket to more than 300 put list delete requests per second or more than 800 get requests per second we recommend that you open a support case to prepare for the workload and avoid any temporary limits on your request rate

at very high speeds amazon s3 does have some recommended request rate and performance considerations but this is only when making more than 300 put list delete requests per second or more than 800 get requests per second for a particular bucket


smaller view upper
put the string in strings.xml set it to a text view inside a scroll view so that it doesn t get hidden on smaller screens set autolink to make the links clickable

i need to form a layout in which i want to put an image in the upper 50 of the screen two edittext two button in the lower 50 of the screen and also it should be device independent so that the view doesn t get disturbed on smaller or bigger screens it works fine on minimum 3.2 hvga device but everything goes overlapped if run on a even smaller device


post methods url
you have mentioned that we can t use actions more than get post put delete which is not true

you could manage more than get or post like put delete...

so since it is only semantic you can do whatever you want in the controller once you get the request and i suppose your rest-api does not include complex updates of say a part of a list or specific fields in nested objects - i believe put would be the better choice

type book why do we need anything more than http get put post

from an interface design standpoint you want user-agents to make post and put and delete more difficult than get or at least distinctly different so that users can rely on that difference to hint when their actions might cause a change in the resource state because they are responsible for those changes

where 404 may be suitable for get and put update but less suitable for post inserts

i was digging through the flask pluggable views documentation and while i find the methodview to be very helpful for making restful crud endpoints usually i end up wanting more than just get post put delete methods under a base route with common decorators and so forth

q1.i know that post is better than put for name-value pair parameters as the get exposes it in url and post doesn t

you can change the http verb near the url parameter to get post put delete or more

given http supports various methods like get put post delete and more like patch head options etc

restful services does not implement an exact way to transfer the info you can use path query string form string or even multipart data so you can do it as you want but in your case instead of using get method with all the data in the query a post or put is more appropiate and you will not hit the query string limit

both get post user can put any thing in it and you must filter any input that user make it in your form example the value in textfiled sent to server by post method and that don t make it safer than get method the difference between them that the textfiled value doesn t visible in url


frequent getrandom table
hash table if get put are much more frequent than getrandom

sorted vector resizable array if getrandom is much more frequent than get put

you got at least put and delete although they are used much less frequent than get and post as in hardly ever


activemq	rabbitmq---------------------------------------------------

easy worse sense
what does rabbitmq do better or worse than activemq

it seems activemq is better than rabbitmq in the sense that it is easy to set up and maintenance for cluster


sctp	tcp---------------------------------------------------

network different packets
sctp is not better than tcp in any way but it does something different

how sctp is better then tcp

so if you want a entire file of 93mb to be reassembled by transferring fragmented packets over the network such that no packets are dropped then tcp sctp is a better choice


uicollectionview	uitableview---------------------------------------------------

repetitive performance possible
i also read somewhere that uicollectionview has much better performance in displaying variable-sized content would it be worthwhile possible to try configuring a uicollectionview to display the messages and somehow make it look like a uitableview

you might have better luck with a uicollectionview instead of a uitableview

if the layout is repetitive a uitableview uicollectionview is a better choice

first i thought to use uitableview but i have read that uicollectionview would be better

if you don t want to use it in either a uitableview or a uicollectionview you re probably better of without it

as abhishekkharwar said there are many other ways to do this better as using uicollectionview or uitableview but you have to decide what fits better on your app needs

2 uitableview and uicollectionview both are better than others when you want to manage complex views

i am not sure what you are trying to do but i think a simple uitableview or uicollectionview may be better for you because they have datasource method that will automatically called when a view will show up in the screen


passenger	unicorn---------------------------------------------------

tools fit better
unicorn and passenger are way better tools than mongrel clusters

the better question to ask might be which one of passenger unicorn is a better fit for containerised rails apps


folder	dir---------------------------------------------------

bin svn name
there are no guarantees that dir which is the name of a folder within your source dir will be longer in number of chars than the number returned by the randrange

i did first try deleting the .svn folder from the bin directory but all that did was cause it to complain that the bin dir was no longer under source control and halt


wav	ogg---------------------------------------------------

mod likely codec
it is likely that wav is using a more compressive codec such as mp3 or ogg internally

it is a high level 2d and 3d cross platform windows mac os x linux sound engine and audio library which plays wav mp3 ogg flac mod xm it s3m and more file formats and is usable in c++ and all .net languages c# visualbasic.net etc

better flac
regearding your comment i also know that it can deal with flac better than wav and ogg that is not really the case

i also know that it can deal with flac better than wav and ogg


vbscript	vba---------------------------------------------------

onclicklistener	onitemclicklistener---------------------------------------------------

n-gram	words---------------------------------------------------

tcplistener	tcpclient---------------------------------------------------

difference easy class
the difference between socket and tcplistener tcpclient is that tcplistener tcpclient is easier to use than socket

what i suggest that you use sockets for you needs you can use the framework socket class but tcplistener class and tcpclient class are much more easy to use


cifs	smb---------------------------------------------------

maven	m2e---------------------------------------------------

likely plugins wtp
moreover i m using m2e the maven plugin for eclipse so it seems that the compatibility of any maven plugins that might work by themselves is even less likely with m2e

as far as i remember the support of wtp was removed from the plugin since the maven eclipse m2e plugin got more advanced


wordpress	joomla---------------------------------------------------

great faster powerful
bigger better than wordpress you re typically looking at joomla or drupal there are others these are just the most common ones

i speak of great experience in this area as i have developed my own cms over a cumulation of years and selling the cms becomes even much tougher as joomla wordpress and drupal have a price point that you cannot complete with

looking into cms s like wordpress drupal or joomla would be a better option as compared to have it on file system although i would like to point out that those cms s are capable for more than just serving static pages

i am good at wordpress and have far more knowledge then i have regarding drupal or joomla

i mean it came as a surprise to me that drupal is so much faster than wordpress and joomla

but drupal i believe is more powerful than wordpress and joomla

while wordpress is great the simplicity of it gets the better of it joomla is far more flexible and has a huge support network and extensions library


points menu better
is this is the case wordpress or joomla might be better starting points

if that will solved later than wordpress menu is better than joomla

imho wordpress is better do work and customize than joomla


cassini	iis---------------------------------------------------

faster slower
i thought iis should be faster than or at least as fast as cassini

what could be the reason that makes iis slower than cassini


purpose use full
you are on vista iis got better 7 cassini stayed crappy

from this question i found out that iis server is better than cassini for my purpose but i don t know how to check the default server of my website

cassini was much better than iis express but doesn t properly support the integrated pipeline

iis express is a web server albeit better than cassini iis express is not your problem

granted iisexpress is much better than cassini but if there is no reason to not use full iis then i conitnue to advocate it s use

cassini or iis express are much better alternatives and are directly integrated into visual studio

while iis does give us better performance than cassini we would still like to be able to hit f5 to run our application from within visual studio


printf	strcpy---------------------------------------------------

wan	lan---------------------------------------------------

vb6	vba---------------------------------------------------

elasticsearch	kibana---------------------------------------------------

context level better
as kibana is the webui for elasticsearch it is better make it high availability

this is too high level to implement this on kibana lets make it more in elasticsearch context


pylons	pyramid---------------------------------------------------

rspec	capybara---------------------------------------------------

solution tutorial better
using capybara instead of rspec is a better solution for request intergration tests

is there any tutorial for capybara and rspec to understand better about those


theano	lasagne---------------------------------------------------

matlabpool	parfor---------------------------------------------------

yslow	pagespeed---------------------------------------------------

tool better
imho pagespeed is better than yslow

when using yslow or pagespeed which is a better tool try and use control+f5 to refresh your page so the site is forced reloaded without any offline files


velocity	rythm---------------------------------------------------

pure strong high
rythm is a strong typed java template engine using razor like syntax with high performance 2 to 3 times faster than velocity and fm

rythm is a high performance 2 to 3 times faster than velocity pure java template which use razor like syntax

the benchmark shows rythm is 2 to 3 times faster than velocity on a normal page


webchromeclient	webviewclient---------------------------------------------------

floyd-warshall	dijkstra---------------------------------------------------

v time complexity
the floyd-warshall algorithm has a worst case performance of o |v| 3 where as dijkstra s has a worse case performance of o |e| + |v|log |v|

indeed floyd-warshall s algorithm is better than dijkstra s in this case the complexity for dijkstra is o m n 2 and in this problem m is much much higher than n so the o n 3 time complexity of floyd-warshall is better

the floyd-warshall algorithm has a worst case performance of o |v|3 where as dijkstra s has a worse case performance of o |e| + |v|log |v|


cpu	irq---------------------------------------------------

consistency	acid---------------------------------------------------

strncmp	strcmp---------------------------------------------------

comparisons slower note
note strncmp is safer than strcmp

in few words strncmp is safer then strcmp but it is slower too

strncmp is a little bit safer than strcmp because you specify how many comparisons will be made at most

you should use strncmp to compare your strings it s safer than strcmp

but even in that approach i always prefer to use the safer strncmp than strcmp

also have a look at strncmp which is safer version of strcmp


opera	firefox---------------------------------------------------

browser webkit internet
answers in opera was checking browser support for my page and wanted to search some stuff up. i don t get this message in my default browser google-chrome nor in internet explorer or firefox

look every browser like mozilla firefox google-chrome opera have thier own design for modal window

usually you want to avoid solutions from browser-vendor as they ll cater toward that specific browser but opera webkit google-chrome safari firefox devs are usually more knowledgeable in terms of cross-browser solutions and compliance with the standards than m ones

in fact i ran some tests at dhtml kitchen and found that in firefox opera and google-chrome document.write was actually faster on the first load and comparable in speed of standard html on subsequent refreshes

using any other browser google-chrome firefox and opera it s much quicker

the results varied from a browser to another firefox 4.0b12 is faster using but google-chrome webkit and opera is faster when using


smaller browsers div
now this works fine in google-chrome and safari and i have had to use assitional css settings for firefox but ie and opera both display my ribbon div about 25px higher than in google-chrome or safari

but on all of the mobile browsers i ve tried firefox google-chrome opera it s much smaller around 25 of the size specified

why in firefox text smaller left than in google-chrome and opera right

i d support both ie still has a big chunk of the user space with firefox and others opera safari etc.. occupying a smaller percentage of the browser market

on your screenshot div width in opera is bigger than in firefox and google-chrome

all the webkit-based browsers safari google-chrome and opera should be closer in their rendering to each other than firefox or ie 9 separately

it s way faster on ie but other major browsers firefox google-chrome safari and opera perform better when using a container and then appending it fragment or div


slower worse lower
in safari it is several pixels higher up than in firefox and google-chrome and significantly lower in opera

much better than opera firefox and google-chrome

incidentally the scrolling on the windows version of safari is fine albeit a little slower than ie opera and firefox

on linux google-chrome displays text about one pixel higher than firefox and opera

the problem with this code is that it doesn t quite work on firefox and works even worse on opera

for example i ve read that opera and ie will fix framerates slower than firefox

only firefox and opera seem to have this issue opera even worse than firefox but i don t care that much about opera

apparently opera ie and firefox works better with

it seems to be slower in google-chrome and firefox but is significantly faster in opera

in opera it goes little bit lower than in firefox

worse than opera and firefox on the desktop as well

firefox google-chrome opera and safari all handle it better

conclusion diff1 is faster in firefox opera and safari diff2 is faster in ie and google-chrome

in ie opera and firefox it looks much better because aa is used which is still clearly visible but not that bad


integer	unsigned---------------------------------------------------

larger 32-bit fit
it won t fit in a 32-bit unsigned integer you need something larger

one advantage of this approach over using a larger than 32-bit unsigned integer for the calculation is that it can be extended to work with bigger integersâ â â with 64-bit integers and uintmax_t integers â â by changing the constant from uint32_max to uint64_max or uintmax_max

the problem is that the input integer is larger than what would fit in an unsigned long long

however a long can represent a larger value than an unsigned integer

a 64 bit unsigned integer can be larger than that


bigger data k
a number bigger than 64bit can never occur in a multiplication because c is an unsigned integer of 32 bits and k is a unsigned short of 16-bit

i do have the guarentee that the signed integer is always bigger or equal than the unsigned integer in bytes so no data should be lost due to lack of space


conversion routine warning
as far as the compiler is concerned the conversion from integer 0 to unsigned int is no better than the conversion from integer 0 to pointer

the integer to unsigned conversion routine to_unsigned can produce a warning if the input integer value is greater than can be expressed in the number of bits specified 6 so the result is clamped to 6 bits with the mod operator


operand type rank

size bigger int
if the native integer size was smaller than 64-bit you could use the same theory but you d have to loop over the array sizeof cachedarr sizeof unsigned int times

both of following types are semantically equivalent minimum 64bit integer without sign and with equal or bigger size than unsigned long int

it might even be bigger than any integer type but if there is some integer type which is the right size and you that integer type will be typedef d to intptr_t and its unsigned version probably more useful will be uintptr_t


nothing place address
at the end of the day a pointer is nothing more than an unsigned integer whose value normally points to some place in memory

to return an object from a function you return a memory address 32 or 64 bit unsigned integer which implies nothing more than pushing a single integer onto the stack


types division narrower
integer types both signed and unsigned which are strictly narrower than an int are converted to a signed int

furthermore signed integer types just tend to be more useful than unsigned types

in case of unsigned integer division this problem does not arise which is why generally integer division works much faster for unsigned types than for signed types


use texture natural
and by the way are you sure you need a signed integer texture as unsigned would be much more natural for your use case

the idea here is threefold readability using operator functions with compatible left and right arguments as well as return value and the use of integer multiplying operators being faster than unsigned operators


better pn uintptr_t
often an unsigned integer is a better choice then you can use uintptr_t

note you will need 2 bytes the represent any port number so pn 16 integer or pn 16 unsigned will be better

an unsigned integer is a better choice for a value being treated as a set of bits anyway.


easier top arbitrary
i was also wondering if there is a way of storing an integer unsigned it s easier on an arbitrary number of bytes

so having an unsigned integer is easier because nulling the top bits is enough.


range like-sized platforms
as we move to 64-bit platforms the unsigned range of a signed integer should be more than enough for most purposes

regarding promoting a like-sized signed integer to an unsigned integer where the signed integer is not in range of the unsigned integer it is less than zero 0


passenger	puma---------------------------------------------------

powerpc	i386---------------------------------------------------

coalesce	nvl---------------------------------------------------

first portable ifnull
the coalesce function is used here because it is more portable than nvl or ifnull

you could also use nvl but that is a legacy function and coalesce is quicker since it stops at the first non-null

the ansi standard function coalesce is simpler than using nvl and decode which should be obsoleted anyway


requestfactory	gwt---------------------------------------------------

slower design json
gwt requestfactory by design is slower than gwt rpc and gwt json etc

from gwt 2.1 requestfactory is better counterpart than gwt rpc when you use db4o together


scatter	graphing---------------------------------------------------

filesystems	xfs---------------------------------------------------

rss	feed---------------------------------------------------

faster rsssyndication fwiw
i ve been working with rss quite a bit and have found that atom feed are typically easier to parse using the rsssyndication class

the atom feed option seems to load faster than the rss one fwiw


xml html things
if your service already has an rss feed things are even easier with the rss reader integrated in the buzzbox api

if i am parsing an rss feed with php and xml how can i parse more than one feed using one fopen statement

those are well-known formats and extracting informations from such xml feed would be much easier than getting it from an html page with rss atom you ll just have to parse the xml feed and extract the tags that contain informations that interest you

writing an xml parser to parse rss feed will be much easier than parsing the html using jsoup

have a look at this rss feed it replaced the greater html sign to gt

that will result in your feed looking even more garbled than it already does because the php will be double-encoded once for the rss xml and again for the html contained in the rss xml


better net blog
and as an aside if you re trying to get the list of articles on your blog reading the rss or atom feed might be easier though i suppose it might not have all the info you need

better than twitter feed is engator - rss to twitter and facebook

when browsing news sites with firefox it will display a rss icon in the addressbar if the site has rss feed which makes it easier to discover feed

if you just need to read articles from the website and display them in your android app maybe using the built in rss feed would be better for you www.example.com feed you can parse that feed into your app in a very simple way

google s services that generate feed generally do a better job at producing atom rather than rss

is there any way of better dealing with large rss feed

edit .net servicemodel.syndication - changing encoding on rss feed this is a better way


complex business world
from experience i ve found real world feed are often more complex than the rss parser can handle

wikipedia defines web services as a software system designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network. as implementation they are more complex than rss feed and are usually used to integrate business applications like connecting an erp with a crm system


api search ideal
if necessary i am willing to use the twitter api directly to do the search instead of using rss but for my purposes using a feed is more ideal

google does this because their feed api can parse more than rss


atoi	atof---------------------------------------------------

min	rank---------------------------------------------------

memcpy	strncpy---------------------------------------------------

world byte slower
memcpy will always be faster than strncpy for any real world situation even in the corner case i spoke before look page_copy_fwd_maybe

strncpy - memcpy is faster but you need to know the size of the input string

memcpy is rarely slower than strcpy or strncpy and often significantly faster

memcpy can be faster than strcpy and strncpy because it does not have to compare each copied byte with 0 and because it already knows the length of the copied object


lemmatization	stemming---------------------------------------------------

user version consider
you can also user a stemming which is a simpler version of lemmatization

2- consider stemming instead of lemmatization stemmers are much simpler smaller and usually faster than lemmatizers and for many applications their results are good enough


vmware	virtualbox---------------------------------------------------

better alternatives performance
from my experience vmware 5 is faster than virtualbox 4.2 rc3 and has better smp performance

i am not sure if vmware server will be much better than virtualbox

fwiw i have never gotten freebsd to work properly under virtualbox perhaps if you need that you would be better off with vmware which does

between hyperv vmware and virtualbox there are much better alternatives available

virtualbox is slower than vmware

in my experience i ve found that vmware seems to be faster than virtualbox although i don t have any hard data to back it up

i have tried both vmware and virtualbox and found virtualbox to be better for my setup


free good powerfull
virtualbox free but less powerfull than vmware

even though vmware has been faster for me i still use virtualbox because it s good enough and is free and im cheap


virtual machine feature
using a virtual machine such as vmware or virtualbox makes this easier

the vm mentioned in here is not like in vmware or virtualbox it is more like java virtual machine jvm as well as python and ruby

and in fact modern processors often have a built-in virtualization feature which even allows virtualization software such as virtualbox or vmware to run the instructions natively while the virtual part is done by the cpu itself allowing much faster execution speed of virtual machines.


daemons	systemd---------------------------------------------------

entity-relationship	diagram---------------------------------------------------

class humans difficult
oo class diagram is more abstract and has more features than entity-relationship diagram

usually relationships found in entity-relationship diagram are more difficult to understand for humans than relationships in class diagram

class diagram are more likely to map in to real-world objects while entity-relationship diagram most often map in to the tables in the database

i have found the uml class diagram to be much more helpful for doing a logical data model or domain model than an entity-relationship diagram

found in entity-relationship diagram are more difficult to understand for humans than

uml s suitability for analysis is one reason why you tend to see uml class diagram that look more like entity-relationship diagram

yes class diagram can be used in a similar way but entity-relationship diagram offer a better visualization and support specific presentation options

would diagramming mongodb schema in a class diagram uml format be feasible as entity-relationship diagram relate more to sql


ddl nothing synchrnoization
it s the only conceptual modeling tool available for relational data the others - erwin and its ilk - being at best logical modeling tools with nothing much better than entity-relationship diagram and ddl synchrnoization which are also provided by object role modeling tools

entity-relationship diagram always seem to better describe a database


simpler easier uml
entity-relationship diagram may be easier for you to learn

entity-relationship diagram are simpler than uml diagram


eventlet	gevent---------------------------------------------------

goto	break---------------------------------------------------

harder worse
branching around whether it is with goto or break just makes it harder

but break is no better or worse than goto


better purpose c-like
basically continue and break are better but often just disguised goto statements.

labeled break like in java would be better than goto for this purpose

in the previous example break is better than goto

but goto is better than break when you have nested loops like that

nevertheless in my opinion break is not much better than goto its both not a good programming style

to any seasoned developer of a c-like language break will both read better as well as provide a cleaner solution than goto


older languages equivalent
it is the equivalent of a goto but is more restrictive in that labels may be used only in break or continue statements

those break statements are being used in the same way that goto is used in older languages


loop faster bad
there s not really a graceful way to break out of for l although it is much faster than a goto loop

the bad we use a break that is little more than a tamed goto something like goto the end of the loop


loop nested structural
if you re in a nested loop and need to break out of all loops a goto can make this much cleaner and simpler than break statements and if-checks

the idea of saying break out of the nth nested loop is worse than a goto from a structural perspective


implements	extends---------------------------------------------------

note mouseadapter listview
second in order to add or update the value of listview in general extends arrayadapter is much easier than implements baseadapter because of arrayadapter support add remove insert method by itself

note extends mouseadapter is easier since you only need to implements the methods you want to handle


orthogonal class reference
i switched a thread from extends thread to implements runnable implements runnable is better practice right

i have read that implements runnable is better than extends thread but i have no idea of how

but whether or not your use an anonymous class is orthogonal to the question of whether implements runnable or extends thread is the better mechanism to define your thread task

if your goal is education and not ease of implementation you would probably be better served by extends the uicomponent class and using the treeitemrenderer code as a reference to create a class that implements the same interfaces

when you extends you incorporate the code of the superclass into yours sometimes there is no code to incorporate so implements is better suited

public class mealhistoryactivity extends activity implements connectioncallbacks onconnectionfailedlistener locationlistener ..

we can either extends thread which will implicitly implements runnable but then we can t extends any other class so implements runnable is better approch

however rather than extends actionlistener as in your second example you ll probably find that putting the listener implementation into a different class even an inner class which implements actionlistener provides better logical logical separation of your code

i have not found a lot of times when implements an interface would be a better system than extends a superclass

i also know implements runable is better than extends thread

implements runnable is better because you can extends other classes

which i think makes sense because extends from a class should take higher priority than implements from an interface

why is implements runnable a better option than extends from thread class

they say that implements runnable is more preferrable than extends thread


pbkdf2	salt---------------------------------------------------

random hash iteration
in django for example passwords are hash with pbkdf2 or bcrypt but session hash use a less complex hmac and no random salt

just use pbkdf2 to make your hash directly make a 64 bit 8 byte random salt use a higher iteration count 4000-10000


longer purpose faster
why do people suggest using key stretching algorithms like bcrypt pbkdf2 which take longer to calculate on purpose rather than using faster algorithms which are also secure like salt sha-256 or sha-512 and using a throttling mechanism to limit brute-force attacks

it should be in my opinion more strongly noted that password hashing with salt is no longer secure and should not be used as others noted use pbkdf2 or bcrypt


better good ideal
an hmac is a better way of adding your salt and pbkdf2 is based on hmac - see below for more detail on pbkdf2 - there s a good discussion at when is it safe to use a broken hash function

a randomly salt one way hashing algorithm would be ideal and sha1 and above should be fine though pbkdf2 would be better


ilist	icollection---------------------------------------------------

idictionary specialized interface
idictionary and ilist are more specialized interfaces that extend icollection

ilist is a more specialized interface that extend icollection


large collection better
compared to ienumerable and icollection ilist performs much better for large or dynamic lists because it provides an indexer allowing us quick random access

for list explicitly yes it should be private depending on what the functionality you re exposing is supposed to do interfaces such as ienuemerable icollection or ilist would be a better choice or if you re exposing a collection see slaks reply


config	ini---------------------------------------------------

faster script options
being php parseing it is nearly eg the file needs to be opened closed etc as fast as having the code at the top of each script and much faster than ini and xml config solutions

ini is really a much simpler format than xml if you have less than fifty config options and they are not nested


srt	subtitle---------------------------------------------------

features options formatting
srt subtitle are much simpler than ass and don t support rotation but you can manually add it with the filter

srt is simpler than ass but lacks features so you may need to use the force_style option in the subtitle filter

ass supports more formatting options but srt is a simpler format and can be modified with the force_style option in the subtitle filter


decltype	auto---------------------------------------------------

uicontrol	uibutton---------------------------------------------------

opencart	magento---------------------------------------------------

floating-point	integer---------------------------------------------------

types uint8 numbers
because integer types like uint8 have saturated arithmetic in matlab plus floating-point types have more precision when doing certain operations

nsdecimalnumber and the floating-point types may be able to store bigger numbers than the integer types though with decreasing precision


largest root smallest
i know c++ have functions that return largest or smallest integer that is greater or lower than a like ceil or floor.is there a function that implement digit limitation of floating-point variable

note that your program may report some numbers as prime if their largest prime factor is very close to their square root if the number is the square of a prime because the conversion of number to a floating-point value may round it down so trsq may end up being less than the square root even less than the largest integer that is smaller than the square root


faster slower division
if you need more than integer accuracy but want to avoid floating-point consider using fixed-point arithmetic instead

which uses all integer arithmetic is usually faster than its floating-point equivalent likely significantly faster in the case of a floating-point type equivalent to t-sql s decimal type

note that it is usually advisable to use an unsigned integer rather than an int to access the bits of floating-point encodings because unsigned integers are less prone to certain issues such as sign issues with bit shifts

integer math is often much faster than floating-point so such a function could be a major performance win

but another added benefit of this approach is that it could make your program run faster since fixed-point integer arithmetic is much faster than floating-point arithmetic

generally integer math is faster than floating-point math

as a rule of thumb floating-point is about 2x slower than integer on

depending on context floating-point code may be as fast as or faster than integer code or it may be four times slower

if all the values vary each time then it seems unlikely that the floating-point division to compute the 1.25 followed by floating-point multiplication is going to be any faster than the integer multiplication followed by integer division

you re performing integer division which is coarser than floating-point division

historically floating-point could be much slower than integer

floating-point arithmetics is by far more complicated than integer arithmetics

it s even possible that you could implement pong using only integer arithmetic which is likely to be faster than floating-point -- but the difference is unlikely to be critical

floating-point divide is faster than integer fewer bits to divide assuming your cpu has floating-point unit

historically floating-point could be much slower than integer arithmetic

today s floating-point units are pretty fast and may actually divide faster than an integer unit

floating-point may be somewhat slower than integer but it s generally

an individual floating-point division instruction will take longer than an integer one

i was wondering about some of the math or theory of whether a signed integer or signed floating-point representation in n bits encodes more granularity between its min and max values or if the two encode the same granularity

but integer arithmetic arguably is inherently simpler than floating-point

floating-point division is typically faster than integer division on the cpu

there are lots of cpu gpu combinations where a 32b integer multiply is faster than a 32b floating-point multiply on cpu and vice-versa on gpu

my question is why do both integer and floating-point multiplication execute faster than their addition counterparts

they take up more space and floating-point math is slower than integer math


larger format n+1
therefore ieee 754 single precision floating-point format has 23-bits fractions and int type has 32 bits so if the integer is larger than 2 24-1 the float type can t represent it exactly

floating-point solves the more general problem of representing some real numbers that aren t integers and some real numbers that are larger than the maximum integer up to which all integers are representable here 16777216 all with a nearly uniform relative accuracy at least 1 2 precision

a floating-point format with a n-bit fractions can t represent the integer which is larger than 2 n+1 -1 because it will lose the precision


redmine	trac---------------------------------------------------

open box projects
redmine handles multiple projects and sub-projects right out of the box and overall seems nicer than trac

redmine is an open source ruby on rails application that supports multiple projects much better than trac and seems to be much easier to administer


authors opinion wound
i haven t tried coded or retrospectiva but i ve used both redmine and trac and in my opinion redmine is better because

redmine was written to be a better trac than trac

we found redmine to be a better than trac simply because it is easier to use

the authors of redmine are trying to create a better trac than trac

i wound up going with redmine and it s way better than trac


libsvm	liblinear---------------------------------------------------

bash	tcsh---------------------------------------------------

jpql	hql---------------------------------------------------

works jqpl superset
because hql is more or less superset of jpql it of course works also in hql

one way to query those is following jqpl hql being more or less superset of jpql


division	addition---------------------------------------------------

precedence random logic
it is also possible to manipulate the inputs so that various parts of the calculation return 0 for addition or subtraction or 1 for multiplication or division to make testing easier but this only gets me so far

multiplication division and modulo have the same precedence and they all have higher precedence than addition and subtraction

multiplication and division operators have higher precedence than addition and subtraction in c++ same as in scientific notation

it will be much slower i don t have benchmarks but i would guess at least an order of magnitude maybe more decimal will not benefit from any hardware acceleration and arithmetic on it will require relatively expensive multiplication division by powers of 10 which is far more expensive than multiplication and dividion by powers of 2 to match the exponent before addition subtraction and to bring the exponent back into range after multiplication division

the addition and subtraction are much more than multiplication and division

the term is apparently not an exact measurement as it is clear that a double-precision floating-point operation is going to take longer than a single-precision one and multiplication and division are going to take longer than addition and subtraction

i found it fairly easy to generate addition subtraction and multiplication questions at random however division is more tricky

the intuition would say addition subtraction are faster than multiplication division but is that really correct

in general you ll have more variation with multiplication and division than with addition and subtraction

division is performed by repeated subtraction therefore needs more level of subtract logic making division slower than addition

apart from that multiplication is addition done more than once and division is subtraction done more than once

i don t think they have a natural precedence unlike say multiplication and division being of greater precedence than subtraction and addition because they can be built from subtraction and addition

i don t understand why the division multiplication in c++ is so much slower than addition subtraction where the managed c# version is more reasonable to my expectations

integer multiplication division and modulo are much slower than integer addition and subtraction

multiplication and division have higher priority than addition and subtraction

the operations are always algebraically simple never involving anything more than addition multiplication subtraction division and taking powers

to start with i need multiplication and division to take higher precedence than addition and subtraction

multiplication is more expensive than addition subtraction and division is more expensive still

finally we all know that multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction so we can remove the extraneous parentheses so this turns into

i know the basics division and multiplication higher than addition and subtraction but i would have to look up something more esoteric

multiplication and division have a higher precedence than addition and subtraction

typically operations like addition and subtraction are much faster in integer -- multiplication and division less so

division multiplication has higher precedence than addition subtraction and parentheses is required to do addition subtraction before multiplication division

implementing multiplication and division might be more costly than you would like but at least addition is easy modulo protecting against over underflow and you claim to not need any operations so even better

nothing follows the rule of multiplication and division having more precedence over addition and subtraction

this is happening because the concatenation operator has a higher precedence than the addition or subtraction operators but multiplication and division have a higher precedence then concatenation


example time loop
for e.g if i do an addition vs division in a loop will the calculation time for addition be less than that for division

best example the division it an an addition are both o 1 but usually the division takes far more cycles time to execute than the addition


rodbc	rjdbc---------------------------------------------------

dom4j	xom---------------------------------------------------

dom apis world
there are many tree representations of xml available in the java world jdom xom dom4j that are vastly more usable than dom

there are libraries that build on the xml apis jdom dom4j or xom which are easier to use than the raw apis

you might find that other tree apis like jdom xom and dom4j are more to your liking


free	realloc---------------------------------------------------

new-memcpy-delete results pointer
a realloc can occur significantly faster than a malloc memcpy and free

if nfa- numstates is greater than arraysize free previous memory and realloc arrays of size nfa- numstates

as you can see from the above tests realloc is consistently faster compared to memalloc memcpy and free

generally new delete and malloc realloc free arrange for more memory from the os using sbrk or os-specific-equivalent and divide the pages up however they like to satisfy the program s allocation requests

i m not saying that realloc is worse than implementing realloc using a malloc free

if you don t mind the libc allocation functions realloc is even more efficient it wont copy the data on a shrink just mark the extra memory as free and if you grow the memory and there is memory free after it will mark the needed memory as used and not copy either

that s why realloc can temporarily require more memory than a malloc free pair

if i try to use realloc to allocate less memory for a pointer than it initially had allocated will the redundant memory be free or will the reallocation result in a memory leak

i ve already tried using realloc to reallocate more memory to my array after using free but when i try to do it my results are either a unexpected shut of the execution or a lot of crazy plots..

if you work with data that doesn t need construction destruction and requires reallocations a large array of ints then i believe malloc free is a good choice as it gives you realloc which is way faster than new-memcpy-delete it is on my linux box but i guess this may be platform dependent

in c you would use malloc to get memory realloc to get more memory and free to release memory

malloc free is harder because thereâ s also calloc and realloc

dynamic memory management on an small embedded system is tricky to begin with but realloc is no more complicated than a free and malloc of course that s not what it does


data internal costs
you could have some initial guess for maxsize 8 and grow when needed your data perhaps by using realloc or just by malloc -ing a bigger new chunk copying the older chunk inside then free -ing that older chunk

a malloc free pair can be better than a realloc if you don t need to keep around the original memory

in the case of overflow a free malloc pair costs less than realloc because of its internal hidden memcpy


addclass	removeclass---------------------------------------------------

toggleclass explicit appropriate
consider if toggleclass is more appropriate than addclass removeclass

of course instead of using toggleclass you could also use addclass and removeclass to be more explicit


broad hover class
i would use addclass removeclass instead of show hide to get better control

that s pretty broad though depending on what you re doing you may be better off with removeclass and addclass

then for class i ve used the addclass and removeclass is better then change it attributes

better approach with addclass and removeclass using hover


range	minimum---------------------------------------------------

maximum values max
but my problem is that the maximum and minimum salary are not known or if the range are smaller then i had to write alot of codes to get the result

basically the result is to find a criteria in row and then in other range find minimum higher than 0 and maximum value

the above statement reads if pay is greater than minimum range or less than maximum range then do things

i want to validate a number as decimal up to two decimal and minimum range is greater than 0.00 and max range is up to 99.99

figuring out the necessary exponent range is much more straightforward if you can describe the max and min possible absolute values of your input you can easily find suitable corresponding binary minimum and maximum exponent

you may initialize both scores to an value lower than the minimum for instance if scores range from 0 to 10 you may initialize them in -1

now you can see in the product.rb i want to fetch the product based on the price so that in the with_min_range the result will be the products whose variants minimum price range will be greater than the value of min

n s e w nw sw ne se. you keep going until the distance to the buckets and therefore all the points in them is greater than your minimum range

the maximum length is only one more than the minimum length abc de fgh i jkl mn opq has seven sub-lists as well but the range of lengths is two here

i have hinted at my analysis of the problem finding the common range of depth values across all datasets and you should be able to track through how i have implemented this in excel to cater for cases where some datasets might contain depth values which are less than the minimum of the common range or which are greater than its maximum or possibly both

to date is greater than the minimum date lesser than the larger date but not in range

what i can t seem to wrap my head around is how to determine the minimum value for the second argument to range that can guarantee the last value in the range is greater than max_val

the reductive point here is the expression can actually be simplified to just the range that has the greater minimum value and the lesser maximum value

if the 32-bit float range is larger than -1..1 then you need to find the minimum and maximum values and calculate a scale factor that gets the samples within the int16 range

for each low end of the range find the minimum high end of a range that is greater than or equal to the low end or in sql

if there is a run for a particular serialnum earlier than the minimum date of the range it won t be excluded

to get the same difference with two different numbers one of them has to be either less than the minimum or more than the maximum of the initial range which is contradictory

a range is contiguous when there is no value one smaller than the minimum and no value one bigger than the maximum and there is no gap within the range

for any particular set of hyperparameters this range is much closer to the minimum response than to the maximum

the smallest most negative value that does not cause a range error is the one greater than the minimum exponent minus the number of bits of mantissa

the objective function is guaranteed to be finite and contionuous in the interpolation range along with its first and second derivatives and has no more than one minimum in this range if it has no minimum it is monotonic

how about for integer values you specify a range and a predicate that specifies the value must be greater than minimum less than maximum instead

the cause for an integer overflow is when an arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value that is outside of the range that can be represented with a given number of bits either larger than the maximum or lower than the minimum representable value

for this reason you need to either try and be smarter than just setting a limit or set you limit a bit higher than the minimum operating range of the sensor


requirements short modern
for example the language standard only mandates minimum range for types like short int and long but they may be wider than the minimum requirements

even though the minimum range requirements for int and short are the same in a typical modern implementation the range of int is usually greater than the range of short


half numberlowexception circle
the -7 argument is less than the minimum allowed range of 0

if the value is less than the minimum value of the range it should throw a numberlowexception

the unfortunate side effect is that half your circle will be cut off as it extends into the range that is less than your minimum value


onclick	onsubmit---------------------------------------------------

submission forms onsuccess
also note that for form submission it is typically better to use the onsubmit event as opposed to the onclick event since forms can technically be submitted by hitting the enter key as well as clicking the submit button

it s just a supposition but try recreating the form widget onsuccess or even hide the form onsubmit actually onclick is better and show another form to the user


first user button
edit to answer your question in comment bellow at first i thought i will bind it to button onclick event but to keep validation that is handy in this case when some questions aren t answered it notices the user about it i think form s onsubmit will be better

you can indeed execute scripts on almost any page using content scripts that can manipulate the dom allowing you to add an onsubmit event listener to a form more reliable than onclick on a button as it is fired however the form is submitted - hitting enter


xlib	xcb---------------------------------------------------

tiff	png---------------------------------------------------

approach smaller bit
the resulting file from this png approach is smaller in size than a tiff file and i guess may rescale better

tiff â any bit depth any compression lossy or lossless everything including the kitchen sink â and no better than png


compression larger jpeg
a 1 x 1 image in the other common formats jpeg png tiff are larger

the resulting png compression may produce a file size larger than your tiff compression


tabcontrol	tabitem---------------------------------------------------

disk	ram---------------------------------------------------

faster slower memory
for the stand of file operations writing to memory ram is always faster than writing to the file on the disk directly

no trivial support for cache accessing ram is faster than accessing disk

the initial read has to access the disk which is a lot slower than accessing ram

or if there is too much intermediate output to be shuffled your job will become slow as you will need disk based shuffle in such a case which will be slower than ram based shuffle

1 yes there is a obvious benefit reading from ram is faster than reading from disk

disk access is much slower than ram

disk even ssd are orders of magnitude slower than ram

disk drives and ram are getting cheaper much faster than your time is

remember the tuples are saved into the disk which is vastly slower to access than things in ram

ram is a lot faster than disk so reads and writes are temporarily stored until the data is requested by the code or the disk is able to receive it

it won t do anything to change the fact that disk io is orders of magnitude slower than ram

saving information to a variable and therefore to ram is always faster than direct to disk

all of rsfalcon7 s suggestions can be combined into a super rule do as much as possible in unshared resources l1 l2 caches - implying economizing on code and data requirements - and if you need to go to shared resources do as much as possible in l3 before going to ram before using synchronization the cpu cycles required to synchronize is variable but is slower - or much slower - than accessing ram before going to disk

as you run queries it has to fetch data from disk which is much slower than ram

the idea is to get the library and application loaded from ram into ram which is much faster than loading from disk

the other ram disk questions like ramdisk slower than disk

disk is bigger than ram

ram is much faster than disk

caching and buffering are quite important since disk are just so much slower than ram and ram is much slower than the cpu

if so just throw in some more ram or get a faster disk array.

only one disk read - since the disk is much slower then ram -

obviously reading a block from cache is much more efficient than reading it off the disk since ram is much faster than disk

using multiprocessing is probably not going to speed up reading data from disk since disk access is much slower than ram access or calculations

if the worker processes do other things than just calulations read from or write to disk they will have to wait a lot since a disk is a lot slower than ram

run the following to sort the data on disk this is slower than pulling it into ram sorting and then writing to disk

query speed is mainly limited by disk i o speed which is at least 1000 times slower than cpu ram speed

which will lead to performance issue all programs will be work slower because read info from disk is slower than from ram

buy as much memory as you can afford ram is alway faster than io from disk

i think it is because the disk is slower than ram

ram is much faster then disk io

this is relatively slow since reading from the hard disk is slower than reading from ram

a solid state drive may even be faster than a ram disk which surprised me

memory is thousands of times faster than disk so if something gets read often having it in ram is drastically faster

disk i o is about 100 000 times slower than ram

but you should consider that disk io is way slower than ram

the ram is much faster than the hard disk

there are two reasons that i can think of as to why a ram disk is slower

as disk is 1000s of times slower than ram as the memory usage increases your machine grinds more and more closer to a halt

ssd disk are good but they are still much slower than ram

ram is a lot faster than disk

a ram disk might seem faster but that s because you aren t factoring in the copy to ramdisk and copy from ramdisk times

as disk is 1000s of times slower than ram this problem can grind the machine down to a practical halt

ram is 100 thousand times faster than disk for database access from

ram is always faster than disk

we all know that the access to ram memory is faster than access to hard disk

just wanted to weigh in my two cents what serialworm and thephpdeveloper said share the fact that memory ram is much faster than any disk io bound operation you come up with

because disk access is orders of magnitude slower than ram access

changing it will require a reboot. that will slow things down a bit as the swap file on disk is much slower than ram

when the data is in memory - you can do anything much faster on it since disk io is extremely slower then ram so sorting it and reading it multiple times is expected to be much slower then manipulating the data on memory

that means that without caching a hit against disk will be 200 times slower than accessing ram

disk io - even ssd - is many orders of magnitude slower than the ram that the hashing is going though

i understand that ram is typically thousands of times faster than disk but i o speed is not the only code running

so even ignoring practical considerations like disk is slower than ram it will be slower

when disk get faster then so does ram and processors and the demand on devices

disk io will be slower than ram

anyway you will have a huge performance loss due to the fact that your disk is way slower than your ram

disk is 100x slower than ram

get more ram themore ram you have the more data can live in cache which is 1000 times faster than reading from disk

loosely speaking ram is 1000 or more times faster than disk and cpu is faster still

for this reason it seemed natural to me to initially load the file into memory and interpret it later at my leisure since reading from ram is supposed to be much faster than from disk

my assumption in the question above is that disk is as fast as ram or faster than ram

but ram and disk are getting cheaper and cheaper so scaling up and having a couple hot hot replicas is actually not all that bad these are props to the the second approach you described

remember disk is 1000s of times slower than ram

if too much memory is consumed it might swap to disk which is slower than ram


efficient location directory
moving the obj directory to a ram disk can be more efficient without having to buy new hardware if i o really is a problem - but it usually isn t

location of the input sorting algorithms on disk are different from algorithms on ram because disk reads are much less efficient when not sequential


system packages ultra-fast
this is slow because your hard disk is significantly slower than ram and at 7gb there will be a lot of data being read from your hard disk put into ram then moved back to your page file the file on disk your operating system uses to store data that has been copied out of ram

there exist battery-backed packages of ram modules which can act as an ultra-fast hdd substitute but if they attach via sata scsi or other typical disk interface the still are slower than system ram


ssd slower need
the first load involves reading alot from the hard disk which is slow even ssd is slower than ram subsequent loads should be faster though 3 seconds on the ssd seem to be odd

a system with a lot of ram will have advantages when switching between different instances of visual studio because their state won t need to be written away to slower than ram disk be it ssd or not

another option is to spend a bit of cash on a 15000 rpm disk or a ssd solid state disk although that ll be slower than a ram disk


machine data low
reloading pages data or program code from disk which is much slower does not usually happen very often as long as the program is actually running and as long as the machine is not desperately low on ram

if the hot data won t fit in ram on either machine then disk i o performance becomes more important than ram mostly random read i o and the fsync flush rate

but ram is volatile the data in ram is erased when the computer loses power and ram is far more expensive than disk per unit of storage


available larger memory
modern operating systems usually get in the way especially if the file is larger than ram you will end up swapping code since the system will treat your already stored on disk data as swappable

alternatively you can use an ssd with file storage in varnish to reduce disk io bottlenecks when using an object cache larger than available ram

the workspace limit is on non-free hosted workspaces any workspace that s private or larger than 1gb disk space and 512mb ram ssh workspaces are unlimited

in the past the redis developers experimented with virtual memory and other systems in order to allow larger than ram datasets but after all we are very happy if we can do one thing well data served from memory disk used for storage

it is needed for a lookup of repetitions in disk files much larger than available ram

in future these lists may be read from disk and larger than available ram

the os heap uses the cpu s virtual memory hardware and is free from fragmentation issues and can even effectively use the disk s swap space allowing you to allocate more memory than available ram

if for any node total resource allocation makes more than all ram cores disk available you are at risk most often at risk of spark task or yarn child being unable to start

i ve written my own protocol since i need it to be lightweight and i m sending files that may be bigger than the ram available on the device â â therefore the files are being streamed straight from the network to disk

if you use map_shared | map_noreserve you can use a memory map much larger than available ram + swap -- but if you run out of disk space or quota your process will receive and die from a sigbus signal.

if your working data set is larger than available ram your server may spend a lot of time shuffling files from disk to memory

just because you have data that is larger than your ram amount doesn t mean the node should go down it just means that not all documents will be available in ram and the node will sometimes have to fetch from disk slower

if your working set is larger than your ram the operating system will be constantly swapping pages out to disk to make room to swap in pages that an application wants to access

edit true the file on disk is not larger than ram but the in-memory representation can easily become much larger than available ram


enough 4gb enterprise
this particular jboss runs in a vm with 4gb of ram and 2 cpu s and more than enough disk space it has never has less than 5gb free at any time

for this reason i deployed a 2 cores 4gb ram and more than enough disk to run through the getting started example of the enterprise integrator


data expensive life
a cache miss at the cpu cache will load more data from ram a cache miss in ram will load more data from disk all this translates into reduced throughput

though writing and reading in the same block of code makes little sense in real life as you should still have the data you ve written and because i o to disk are much more expensive than the ram you were using to keep the data so you may just do

data in ram can take a lot more space than on disk

however they may be cheaper to operate depending on how much data you are expecting to store with each session key holding large quantities of data in ram is typically more expensive than storing on disk

a larger cache reduces the number of reads but up to a certain limit also increases the amount of unsaved data that rethinkdb can accumulate in ram to make disk writes more efficient

note when the data is much bigger than ram performance degenerates into counting the disk hits .

so even if your ram is much smaller than your disk you could assume you can read data that s already in ram 90 of the time or more


usage files ssds
i want to cut large csv files file size more than ram size and use them or save each in disk for later usage

it can be improved via usage of ram disk or adding more ssds to increase iops number routing requests to reduce ping changing modifying os to reduce kernel overhead etc

since the files are all bigger than ram this translates to actual disk usage


speed arithmetic scale
this means that once you can t scale vertically any more by adding ram disk speed etc to a single server you will have to be careful about how you choose to shard

the difference between disk speed and ram speed is more or less an arithmetic factor


larger random amount
when your working set exceeds the amount of ram then it will carry on working but with noticeably degraded performance as things will then be constantly having to go to disk which is far less performant

at some point if you re doing randomish queries and your working set is sufficiently larger than ram then you ll be limited by the small number of random iops a disk can do

if your data size is larger than the amount of ram you can afford you can try to compensate with faster disk and using more smaller disk 8 x 74gb instead of 4x 136gb

so while the writes my be sequential on disk for datasets larger than ram these random reads will quickly become the bottle neck


space cheaper storage
the amount of data in stream is bigger than machine ram or its disk space so it needs to relatively efficient

so everything here should require no work on your part not consume more ram not consume more disk space impose no other overheads never freeze and give you a nice speedup

this is well within disk space but far larger than ram

it is important to give additional space to the ram disk that is 10 bigger than the size of the jvm

basically ram is more expensive than the disk storage

number of cores cpus in slurm disk space and ram are more tricky to get as it might be different on different nodes

so bandwidth was probably viewed as cheaper than server ram and disk storage

disk space and ram are far cheaper than your labor and they are cheaper than a delay getting your project completed and into the hands of users

always favor disk persistence disk storage is cheaper than ram

disk space is probably always going to be cheaper than ram

ram and disk space is more than enough

i m not sure if or how some other limits are imposed if available disk space or available ram are less than the software limits

ram and disk have gotten cheaper but engineering time has not and sharing of source is arguably more portable than sharing of binaries

this approach will radically reduce heap space usage - disk space is cheaper then ram too

it uses swap space on disk to allow for processes much larger than ram


access
more ram means less disk access

and ram access is much more fast than disk access


larger table smaller
writing to a local database or handling a data structure larger than ram will impact the disk making network calls will impact the network hardware cpu bound calculations will impact there

that 1st code takes virtually no ram as it creates from the disk making it smaller by simply skipping pixels from the image

it sounds like the table is a lot larger than ram so this means something like 5555 disk reads -- likely to be the slowest part

i should also mention that this happens once the data is larger than ram and it s increasing size on the disk

a virtual memory is a concept to work for files bigger than ram by using the pages and swapping with disk and ram

the table on disk is bigger than your ram

and the whole purpose of maglev is to have a ruby implementation which can deal with heaps that are orders of magnitude larger than ram by storing them in a distributed cluster on disk

if the working set is smaller than your ram it should not be disk bound


xfce	gnome---------------------------------------------------

redhat	fedora---------------------------------------------------

vim	emacs---------------------------------------------------

slower faster out-of-the-box
i realized that emacs would load slower than vim but this seems ridiculous for a fresh install

emacs and vim have a bigger learning curve but they re also very powerful especially if you re already using them for something else

worse than that i m wondering if learning vim or emacs could make me slower with visual studio as i d confusing short cut keys

and i tend to think that after a moderate amount of customisation of either one vim will still start up faster than emacs

i m saying that on any machine out-of-the-box installs of vim will start up faster than out-of-the-box installs of emacs

emacs and vim are generally smaller faster and optimized for text editing and navigation


better editors certain
like are vim emacs better suited for more advanced users than for beginners

vim was always faster to start up than emacs

it is worth learning both because emacs is better than vim at editing certain languages and doing certain tasks and vice versa

there are definitely some advantages using external editors however emacs is ten million times better than vim

emacs or vim is not significantly better than vim or emacs

i now think the combination of emacs and vim is better than either alternative


polished heavyweight time
it is also usable from emacs and vim but this time the emacs interface seems more polished

i m just looking for something a little more polished than vim or emacs but not quite as heavyweight as netbeans or eclipse


powerful easier respects
i am starting to understand that even though emacs is more powerful than vim vim is at least 10 times easier to use less keystrokes and requires way less modifications

edit going into why vim or emacs is far more powerful in many respects than your typical ide could get quite lengthy and there are already several questions on so which cover that

but it s a lot less powerful than vim emacs

personally i m using emacs right now which i find easier than vim for searching and navigating the code but everyone has their taste


crypt	hash---------------------------------------------------

addition password_hash unrecoverable
my sense is that encode and decode are probably good solutions when you want the data to be recoverable but that unrecoverable hash using crypt md5 is a better approach for stored passwords

in addition using crypt to hash password is better

if you are using it to hash passwords to store them password_hash or crypt are better suited


cpython	pypy---------------------------------------------------

faster slower time
pypy s jit can make python code execute much faster than cpython

i haven t tried comparing the two but this pypy bug seems to suggest that multiprocessing in pypy is slower than in cpython

i finally ran it through pypy and was delighted to discover that when the lists got really deep pypy was running significantly faster than cpython

here is a recent benchmark of jython 2.5.2 running on jvm 7 where jython is slower than pypy but faster than cpython

you could try running it in pypy - for some cases it can be significantly faster than cpython

so at this point in time pypy is just over 9 times faster than cpython in this micro benchmark

the answer is simple here - pickle on pypy is slower because it s implemeneted in pure python as opposed to c in cpython

unfortunately as martijn pieters noted there are no accepted solution for python 3.x and only one for python 2.x and according to the amount of memory spent for solving it numerix could have used psyco the library on which pypy is based much faster than cpython

some people may argue with me on this one but i find pypy to be faster than cpython

this is why pypy may be slower than cpython sometimes it needs a warm-up phase in which it can actually optimize repeated operations

i saw that pypy is generally faster than cpython

as gnibbler pointed out cpython is slower in the simple implementation but pypy is jit compiled for much faster code when you need it

one of the reasons why pypy can be faster than cpython is because pypy is compiled to a completely separate native executable and does not depend on nor execute in cpython

pypy is supposedly faster than cpython while gevent is based on co-routines and greenlets which supposedly makes for a faster web server

judging from the benchmarks posted on the pypy speed center it appears as if pypy is faster than cpython for all but two of the tests presented

however consider that pypy might do the linear search 100 times faster than cpython then a few times might be dozens

the most straight-forward c implementation is 100 times faster than cpython pypy is 10-30 times faster and passes the challenge

the pypy jit for python is also much more complex than cpython but also typically much faster â increased complexity is a fairly typical cost for speed. the four levels of disassembly for julia code give you access to the representation of a julia method implementation for particular argument types at different stages of the transformation from source code to machine code

in the competing programming a lot of problems are never meant to be solved with cpython but with pypy which has a faster integer-arithmetic and a git-compiler but otherwise a python interpreter just as cpython

jython is more unpredictableâ sometimes almost as fast as pypy sometimes much slower than cpython

cpython is faster than pypy on the two tests slowspitfire and waf

for python there is a pypy project which it includes jit making possible the code to run faster than in cpython in many cases

pypy is faster than cpython s sum intrinsic because it can figure out that all the elements of the array are numeric and slice out a bunch of per-element overhead

you might want to try running your trainer under pypy if you aren t already -- it s significantly faster than cpython for some workloads

note that there are plenty of python implementations other than cpython out there - for loopy code pypy tends to be much faster than cpython

i presume it s why is pypy faster than cpython some of the time

if that isn t sufficient a lot of standard python code can be run on the pypy implementation which generally faster than the cpython implementation

just keep in mind most of the time c is faster than python but then again most of the time pypy is faster than cpython

under cpython tests run 4 times faster than under pypy

pypy is now faster than cpython in most cases

so how is it possible for pypy to be faster than cpython also becomes fairly obvious

pypy is currently more than 5x faster than cpython on average

can someone please help to how use that script using the pypy as i heard it is much faster than cpython

pypy which in general is much faster than cpython is considerably slower for this use case

that site does not claim pypy is 6.3 times faster than cpython

part of the compiler toolchain includes an experimental jit generator now in its fifth incarnation and starting to work really well - the goal is for a jited pypy to run much faster than cpython

i ve tried using pypy because i ve heard its faster than the cpython interpreter but still no good

pypy compiled with jit is almost always faster than cpython frequently by a large margin


first better place
the waf benchmark has less of a pronounced difference in performance and i d guess that the answer would be more complicated some factors pypy does better some factors cpython does better and overall cpython comes out slightly ahead

as you can see the program is much quicker under pypy than cpython which is why i moved to it in the first place but at the cost of a 10-fold increase in memory

pypy particularly benefit more from the second approach while cpython fared better on the first approach


data part structures
if the dominant memory usage is program data structures then i wouldn t be at all surprised to find pypy using significantly less memory than cpython whether or not the jit was enabled

when people talk about pypy using less memory than cpython this is a major part of what they re talking about


background-image	background-size---------------------------------------------------

gridbaglayout	grouplayout---------------------------------------------------

simplier hard easier
i recommend you not to use grouplayout is really hard instead of you can try to use gridbaglayout it s simplier

so maybe a gridbaglayout will be easier to use than the grouplayout


calloc	malloc---------------------------------------------------

function strdup able
how does free know how much memory to be free d which was earlier allocated by malloc or calloc

secondly i notice that when i run my program i m seeing the free function call more often than the malloc calloc calls 98 to 16

he cried. will save the string on the static storage and you will not be able to do most of the function on them you better work with strdup in your function or malloc and calloc to be able to use all the function


memset faster memory
it would be better to use malloc over calloc unless we want the zero-initialization because malloc is faster than calloc

calloc is faster than malloc + memset because calloc knows that the mmap d pages are pre-zeroed and memset forces the allocation of physical ram

my question is why is malloc + memset so much slower than calloc

as written malloc would be better than calloc but the question used calloc and it would not be hard to make it sensible for use with this code too for example a conditional assignment in set_matrix such as

assuming the total amount of memory being initialized in your two examples is the same allocating the memory with calloc might be faster than allocating the memory with malloc and then zeroing them out in a separate step especially if in the malloc case you zero the elements individually by iterating over them in a loop

calloc does take longer than malloc because it has to zero out all the memory you asked for before giving it to you

actually calling memset after malloc is closer to calling calloc than the option you suggest

and is as far as i know faster than the combination of malloc and memset on the other hand malloc alone is faster than calloc

see also why malloc + memset is slower than calloc

if end up using the memory anyway calloc is still faster than malloc and memset but the difference is not quite so ridiculous

it s conceivable that calloc could return address of memory location that is already pre-initialized with zeros thus it may be faster than malloc + memset combo

the first calloc subsequently malloc has a longer execution time then

if you re worried about the performance of calloc malloc might be faster simply due to the fact that it does not initialize the allocated buffer as calloc do

this means calloc can potentially be faster than calling malloc followed by memset since it can skip the memset if it knows it will already by zeroed

in fact using calloc instead of malloc would be even better

malloc might be faster than calloc on some implementations

i remember somewhere i have read that calloc is slower than malloc because calloc performs initialization to zero after performing memory allocation

also calloc is slower than malloc from operating system memory allocation perspective

malloc is faster since calloc initializes the allocated memory to contain all zeros

malloc + memset is slower than calloc under certain conditions

in terms of speed calloc is likely to be faster than malloc + memset if memory needs to be zeroed out

calloc itself is slower than malloc because you have to spend some time to clear the contents of allocated memory

calloc does the same thing as malloc but initializes all bytes to zero -- useful when you want to insure all memory is initialized and only slightly slower than malloc

one reason to use calloc over malloc plus memset is that calloc may be more efficient

memory allocation in java is 5x to 10x faster than malloc calloc etc

it takes a page off of the free_page_list updates mem_map zeroes the page and returns the physical address of the page. here s another post that explains it well and also explains why using calloc is better than malloc + memset

this is an enormous amount of extra work and explains why calloc is faster than malloc and memset


realloc heap huge
in this context free store is different and incompatible with heap because the new delete free store library is simpler and quicker than the malloc free realloc calloc heap library and thus provides huge memory usage gains to the c++ embedded programmer in a context where you have only 512 bytes of ram

malloc free is harder because thereâ s also calloc and realloc


printf	strncpy---------------------------------------------------

daemon	cron---------------------------------------------------

hash	salt---------------------------------------------------

better randomness md5
putting the salt at the beginning is better than putting it at the end as more randomness at the beginning of hash is better than randomness at the end

liferay is responsible for storing passwords with encryption or better as salt hash in the database

as you have already mentioned salt hash are much better

in storing hash passwords is a common practice to add a nonce or a salt and is marginally true that this salt is better kept secret

the time to hash the salt you spend better in doing more iterations on the password hashing

with a salt md5 is much more secure than without but you re better off using one of the sha hash such as sha256managed

even though they re hash salt it s still better that attackers do not see them

from an architectural point of view storing the passwords in the db like this isn t a really good idea it would be best to at least store a salt hash or use a better algorithm see

hash password + salt is better but still not good enough.

if your php installation is too old even salt hash with md5 are better than two-encrypted password

the more randomness and more characters your salt has the better for the hash but anything that s several characters long and random works

anyway transmit a salt and hash password is always better than transmit the plain password


plain secure security
the hash can be more secure you can have random salt for every user which makes it computationally expensive for someone to brute force attack the passwords should the database be compromised

hash password by using security salt is more secure than plain text password

if hash are used for more than consistency checks licensing one could use salt and encryption to increase security

as a side note from what i ve read key derivation functions pbkdf2 scrypt bcrypt are considered better more secure #1 #2 than plain salt sha-1 sha-2 hash by crypto people

you should use a strong cryptographic hash function and a salt to make it more secure

in this situation storing password hash and the salt is more secure than storing the credentials encrypted or not because an attacker would have no way of getting the password back even if he manages to get his hands on both the hash and the salt

i get the impression that most people think that hashing salt passwords is the more secure way of handling passwords but i can t figure out a way to comply with current company operations when using hash passwords


harder attacker hacker
never store passwords instead store password hash and random salt read more

you use a salt to make it more difficult for the attacker to get at your passwords because then he would need to know the salt so that he can use it in computing the hash for your passwords

i ve been reading about password hash functions and it s said use a salt to make harder the hacker s work use a height cost algorithm etc

i don t know how safe could it be and how difficult is for the hacker to determinate the technique i use the thing is that the result has the same length as the hash and is harder to determinate a salt so if for any reason in the history hacker uses a rainbow table and catches a probable result it will be the wrong

hash passwords with salt are much harder for an attacker to use than a plaintext password which they can use with the right username

passwords should be hash and salt never encrypted much less encoded

instead use stronger passwords with salt hash which are harder to break using brute force and are not susceptible to rainbow table attacks if the choice is between pin and password

now personally i generally use a salt sha-256 hash on my passwords because i thought that md4 and md5 were no longer secure and that hashing a password multiple times would just put too much strain on a server for no practical benefit

using a hash or similar to detect if the transmission was decrypted having a salt hash makes it harder not impossible to change or forge message contents

that way the hash salt is more random and your data a bit more secure

yes storing the password even reversibly encrypted is worse than a salt hash of some sort due to password reuse

first you probably need to do more than just salt and hash your password

salt just make it harder by forcing an attacker to hash the dictionary on a per-user effectively per-salt basis

most attacks involve generating hash for common passwords so for reasonably complicated passwords it becomes harder especially with salt some people use usernames as salt others use randomly generated numbers

the lack of salt is harder to expoit here than with password hash since the hash is not directly known


rainbow tables sha-512
there are lists available on the internet with millions of already hash values to make hash cracking easier those are known as rainbow tables and they can be easily countered with the use of salt

salt sha-512 offers a higher level of security and implementing a scheme where you stretch the hash is even better do some high number of iterations of sha-512 - starting with the password+salt of course

personally i use sha-512 with a salt because a bigger number in the hash name means a better hash

if the salt is hard-coded into a popular product lookup tables and rainbow tables can be built for that salt to make it easier to crack hash generated by the product


secure different simple
would salt and hash be somehow more secure

i read somewhere that adding a different salt to each hash makes it more secure

pbkdf2 is more secure than a simple hash or even a salt hash


harder life level
salt is used to add an extra level of complexity to the hash to make it harder to brute-force crack

it is supposed i think that the algorithm cost and salt is used to make the life harder to hackers and if i use that my hash will be safer


secure user passwords
so when i see that the salt is stored in the hash password and that you use that hash password as salt i think crypt + salt is not more secure against a brute force on output hackers who managed to steal hash passwords

in django for example passwords are hash with pbkdf2 or bcrypt but session hash use a less complex hmac and no random salt

actually you can insert the passwords as a simple md5 hash it will still work for letting the user login though it is recommended to then change the password through the front end system as the salt passwords are more secure

by using a salt value typically you want this to be a random number the hash won t match the dictionary the chance of them pre-calculating all passwords with all possible salt values is exponentially more difficult

adding a dynamic salt to each user would mean that you will have to hit a datastore to retrieve the dynamic salt and the hash version of the user s password then you will have to perform the cpu intensive hash function in your code twice -- you are hashing a hash which is less secure and more likely to have collisions

as others have mentioned you want to be careful with your hash since it s easy to do something that s not really secure h salt password is far weaker than h password salt but at the same time you want to balance the effort put into this with the value of the site content


longer unique trimmed
you ll probably need to get data anyway so the unique salt is probably faster too because you won t need to calculate the hash over username

this salt is nothing more than a random arbitrary string that you concatenate to the passwords and it will make your hash password unique

example the salt field might only allow a 64 characters while the generated salt might be longer therefore when you save the salt it gets trimmed which ultimately changes the hash password

if we are talking about passwords where you only need to know if the user entered the correct password or not then you could hash the passwords with a salt and compare with the database hash read more about that here link

using the hash value with a salt is much safer if someone breaks into your db no password is there

since the hash is generated using the original long salt using a trimmed salt later would just yield an invalid hash when specifying the original password - it doesn t make it any easier to find a hash collision

you can safely store the salt in the db because working out a string from its hash is just as hard when you know some of the string as it is when you know none of it provided the password itself is longer than the salt and long enough and strong enough to take a long time to crack by brute force at least 6 chars with at least one case change and a number or non-alphanumeric i d say

likely not as cheap as xor against n values but seems like there s possibility for better quality results at a minimal extra cost especially if the data being hash is much larger than the salt value

it is true that randomly generated salt produce a greater amount of security but it is also true that anyone who gets access to a list of your password hash in order to crack them probably has access to your database in which case they have access to your salt

if their original password was longer than the salt + hash you may have just reduced the security of their password assuming a good password and ignoring hash collisions


someone harder purpose
keep in mind the purpose of the salt to make it harder for someone to precalculate hash codes and therefore be able to look up passwords in the case of the database being compromised

the salt shall make it harder to find the original password with a rainbow-table in case someone could steal your database with the hash


splinter	selenium---------------------------------------------------

simpler easier
splinter simpler than selenium

splinter makes it easier to use selenium plus


strtol	atoi---------------------------------------------------

better
you can also use strtol which is obviously better than atoi

strtol can be a better atoi specifically w.r.t


check reporting function
you can also look into strtol which is better than using atoi in terms of error checking

the c function strtol is much better make it a habit to prefer that one to atoi

to convert to integer a string passed as argument to your program use atoi or strtol which does better error checking

strtol is better than atoi with better error handling

if you want to accept a number rather than a digit and only a number strtol works much better than atoi as it allows you to check for failures

for instance strtol is better than atoi and you should be checking each time whether strtok returns null

instead of atoi using a better function like strtol which allows error checking

all have more or less cumbersome and non-obvious error checking involving errno strtol is way much better than atoi in any case so avoid using atoi

once you ve done that you can use strcmp to see if the string is equal to stop and if not then call atoi or better yet strtol which has better error checking to get the numerical value

i would recommend strtol which provides better error handling than atoi or sscanf

you need to error check strtol and ensure there are as many passed before using them -- strtol is better than atoi as helps detect errors

use strtol it does better error reporting than atoi

besides strtol is a better option than atoi as strtol can handle failures better


cocoapods	carthage---------------------------------------------------

swift documentation better
after doing more research i now feel that using a dependency manager like the documentation recommended cocoapods or carthage is a better option than manually adding the framework to the project

i m currently using carthage as a dependency manager and i know cocoapods is more popular and maybe swift package manager will be something in the near future - so i d like to be able to publish the extensions so people using any of these package managers can easily add them to their projects


loops	while-loop---------------------------------------------------

d3.js	protovis---------------------------------------------------

java.util.calendar	java.util.date---------------------------------------------------

api options better
alternatively use the java.time classes if you re using java 8 or joda time otherwise - both are much better options than java.util.date and java.util.calendar

there are some rough edges in terms of the api but it s generally much better than java.util.date and java.util.calendar

its better than java.util.date java.util.date and java.util.calendar combined


free	strdup---------------------------------------------------

things pointer impossible
in c memory most other things are managed by the programmer so strdup is no worse than forgetting to free malloc ed memory failing to null terminate a string using incorrect format string in scanf and invoking undefined behaviour accessing dangling pointer etc

you should know that strdup allocates more memory and returns its pointer which you then overwrite the original pointer returned by malloc so it will be impossible to free that memory since you no longer have the pointers

additionally if you have strdup then it is much more convenient than strlen + malloc + strcpy with identical result including the same obligation to free the allocated storage when you no longer need it


metaclass	subclassing---------------------------------------------------

qtreewidget	qtreeview---------------------------------------------------

suggestion issue use
and one more suggestion instead of using qtreewidget i think qtreeview is a better choice if you can explain the issue a bit more maybe i can provide some sample code

or isn t qtreewidget purposed for this use and a qtreeview would serve better


gdi	direct2d---------------------------------------------------

variables performance shot
disable antialiasing and the performance of direct2d will be on par or faster than gdi

i ve read that direct2d is much faster than gdi so i figured i would give it a shot for dealing with constantly updated variables


memcpy	memset---------------------------------------------------

macro safer strings
your macro with memset and memcpy was not any safer than strcpy

you could use memcpy memset for strings too but strcpy is simpler


ember.js	backbone.js---------------------------------------------------

setinterval	clearinterval---------------------------------------------------

better method cleaner
this is perhaps a bit cleaner with a setinterval instead of a clearinterval

i find this method simpler than using clearinterval to pause and setinterval again to restart

but for your purposes i think setinterval and clearinterval would work better


translation	localization---------------------------------------------------

jsf	seam---------------------------------------------------

uploads damo plain
well for that you ll need jsf that is better integrated with seam and jsf does not handle file uploads that actually everyone use so you have to put also icefaces that actually are better managed by maven that you currenty are not using... neverending story

seam certainly is far better than using plain jsf refer the link posted by damo a couple of answers above


memset	malloc---------------------------------------------------

likely allocation difference
if end up using the memory anyway calloc is still faster than malloc and memset but the difference is not quite so ridiculous

it s conceivable that calloc could return address of memory location that is already pre-initialized with zeros thus it may be faster than malloc + memset combo

one reason to use calloc over malloc plus memset is that calloc may be more efficient

calloc is faster than malloc + memset because calloc knows that the mmap d pages are pre-zeroed and memset forces the allocation of physical ram

my question is why is malloc + memset so much slower than calloc

this means calloc can potentially be faster than calling malloc followed by memset since it can skip the memset if it knows it will already by zeroed

actually calling memset after malloc is closer to calling calloc than the option you suggest

malloc + memset is slower than calloc under certain conditions

it takes a page off of the free_page_list updates mem_map zeroes the page and returns the physical address of the page. here s another post that explains it well and also explains why using calloc is better than malloc + memset

and is as far as i know faster than the combination of malloc and memset on the other hand malloc alone is faster than calloc

see also why malloc + memset is slower than calloc

in terms of speed calloc is likely to be faster than malloc + memset if memory needs to be zeroed out

this is an enormous amount of extra work and explains why calloc is faster than malloc and memset


awt	swing---------------------------------------------------

level lower bindings
for swing typically use key bindings over the awt based lower level keylistener

as a general tip for swing typically use key bindings over the awt based lower level keylistener


useful
as far as when awt may be more useful than swing -

are there any cases where awt is more useful advised to use than swing or vice-versa


better newer components
the only problem is that we don t know what to use our very own engine with awt or if we could use swing to make it easier

these two are completely different logically speaking and you should choose only one of them to go further with note that swt is more customizable and tries to combine the best from awt and swing while swing is more limited and uses the platform s native widgets

the article painting in awt and swing goes into more detail

consider using swing which has much better performance over the old heavyweight awt

swing has newer and better api s than awt

swing or javafx would be better than awt

i have a program an awt frame yes i know that swing is better but i am restricted from using it that has 2 moving objects

ps i m not set on swt if anybody thinks a different library technology such as swing awt is better

i haven t worked with awt much but swing is much better from the gui developer s point of view

yes swing has newer and better api s than awt

in swing has more features than the awt components

it has functionality the same as a canvas but swing is more advanced and has better features than awt

well swing is richer in terms of out-of-the-box components than awt

i personally would just skip using awt and move to swing which provides better built in functionality for this type of thing

generally swing is more efficient and advanced than awt

now go and read performing custom painting and painting in awt and swing to gain a better understand into how painting actually works in swing

its was said that awt is faster than swing as it uses the platform component but due the arrival of faster processor etc ..

swing is better and few people remember how to use awt components

as already mentioned by others better to use swing over awt since swing is more advanced

start by having a read through painting in awt and swing to gain a better understanding of the painting system

swing is far better then awt and should be educated to people who is writing gui-based java for the first time

for example javafx the reason why it is much faster than awt swing ever were is because it contains uses a huge amount of native code

it seems unfortunately i am stuck using awt to do this assignment seeing as swing would be better

i find that the swing library is easier to use than awt although you do still have to use awt for listeners

nobody uses awt anymore because swing is much better

you can read all over the web that awt is old and deprecated and swing is old but newer than awt and should be preferred over awt whenever possible

swing is far better than the obsolete awt library


javafx date days
awt is really out of date people have more experience with swing no days and even javafx

i m doing a project at university which i decided to do in javafx as it is more stylish than swing but i m having difficulty to find an alternative to the filledoval library for the canvas awt as i can t use the canvas awt in javafx


flexible robust gui
also for my money i d create a swing gui not an awt gui as swing is much more robust and flexible

if you want to ditch the zero awt and get with the hero swing read more at creating gui with swing

i suggest if possible that you not code in awt but rather code with swing which is much more robust and flexible

consider creating a swing application not an awt application since swing apps are more flexible powerful and robust

use a swing gui not an awt gui since swing is much more powerful and flexible than awt


framework lightweight libraries
which java framework awt or swing makes more sense for something this simple

swing is a lightweight framework provided by java while awt relies more on native libraries and is considered heavyweight


punctuation	words---------------------------------------------------

longer characters hyphens
note there are some cases you will have to handle here you may have to split at punctuation characters and hyphens and you may have to cope with a single words that is longer than the formatting width

entries with words that are longer than x characters in this case 25 with no punctuation or spaces will cause the html on a printed a4 page to not wrap properly and therefore not to confrom to certain sizes correctly pushing the margins off

in text files for example it is much more probable to have a small letter after a letter than a whitespace or punctuation after a letter since words typically are longer than 2 characters


first space w
alternatively you could accept a-za-z0-9 0 4000 note the space which should get you more than one words but probably not anything after the first punctuation

note that in case your words are separated with more than whitespace punctuation for example use w+


lower cameroon array
i have a string array containing strings words with no punctuation marks all lower case

you might also want to consider sripping punctuation from words and calling lower if you consider cameroon and cameroon to be the same

the was removed stopword cat is now singular stemming punctuation is gone and the words are lower cased


data lower upper
also should stopwords and punctuation be removed from the training dataset and should all words be converted to lower case

did pre-processing of the train data using nltk punctuation stop words removal lower case stemming etc.

and i need to be able to remove all of the punctuation convert to lower cases remove numbers stop words whitespaces from the data frame tweets without having to convert it into a corpus or something

tonight i m attempting to parse words from a file and i d like to remove all punctuation while preserving lower and upper case words as well as white spaces


multiplication	exponent---------------------------------------------------

int slower sqrt
however with really very small parameter 2 in your case exponent is faster than multiplication

if the exponent is 0.5 you should use sqrt and if the exponent is a small integer 2 3 4 expressing the formula with multiplication is faster but less readable

this is analogous to the way you can compute exponent using successive squaring much faster than by repeated multiplication

however naive multiplication will get slower and slower as the exponent increases

as int exponent gets larger taking powers might be faster than multiplication

the misunderstanding is that incrementing the exponent is not faster than doing a multiplication


fadein	fadeout---------------------------------------------------

faster actual result
the while executes much much faster than the fadeout fadein calls so you only see the last result

like the fadein and fadeout is faster than the actual changing the picture


spans untested transition
the smooth transition with the fadeout fadein should look better than the text changing directly

completely untested and you might want to use fadein and fadeout or use better classes both spans should have the same class but different id


methods job simpler
jquery might have better methods than fadeout fadein for this job

fadein and fadeout are simpler jquery functions for fading in and out elements


time delay longer
otherwise you will run into issues of trying to fadein and fadeout at the same time if your delay is shorter than your fadein

more detail set the amount of time the animation will take for fadeout and use a delay for the fadein animation that is longer than the fadeout animation time


filewriter	printwriter---------------------------------------------------

printstream better
i m not sure if printwriter or filewriter is better but printwriter worked for me

you need to create a fileoutputstream and decorates it with printstream or better filewriter with printwriter


emacs	aquamacs---------------------------------------------------

kerberos	ldap---------------------------------------------------

pickle	dill---------------------------------------------------

fork problems job
the dill module which is not in the standard library extends pickle to do even better

where i ve used dill to give you better serializationâ essentially dill can pickle class instances easily -- as well as most python objects

dill has a better serializer that can pickle socket objects on any os and thus sending the socket object with multiprocess works in either case

i think you can do exactly what you want with dill which provides better serialization than pickle

i searched a bit and found that dill can perform better than pickle with classes but i am having problems to implement it

modules such as dill are doing a better job than pickle

cloudpickle might be a good idea for your problem as well it has better support in pickling objects than pickle not per see better than dill and you can pickle code easily as well

the fork uses dill instead of pickle to provide better serialization


acs	adfs---------------------------------------------------

hash	hmac---------------------------------------------------

faster complex term
after looking it s seems that hmac is much faster and better in term of security even if the underlying hash function sha1 is broken which is not the case when using rsa-sha1

an hmac is a better way of adding your salt and pbkdf2 is based on hmac - see below for more detail on pbkdf2 - there s a good discussion at when is it safe to use a broken hash function

in django for example passwords are hash with pbkdf2 or bcrypt but session hash use a less complex hmac and no random salt


git-svn	svn2git---------------------------------------------------

oom tools conversion
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case and should not suffer from oom error

it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but the right svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case

it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case

it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn or tools based on it but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case


kde flexibility superior
you see there are many reasons why git-svn is worse and the kde svn2git is superior

even though git-svn or the nirvdrum svn2git is easier to start with here are some further reasons why using the kde svn2git instead of git-svn is superior besides its flexibility

glassfish	weblogic---------------------------------------------------

coldfusion	railo---------------------------------------------------

profiler	visualvm---------------------------------------------------

heapsort	in-place---------------------------------------------------

profiling	instrumentation---------------------------------------------------

data template job
the time profiling instrumentation is more efficient at gathering data

personally i find shark more useful than instrumentation for profiling my code and finding out what s taking up time when it matters

again though the time profiling instrumentation is far better suited to the job and it definitely works

paulw11 s comment helped--the time profiling template is better suited for this task than the system trace instrumentation


mac core-data tool
if you re writing a mac app the opengl profiling tool profiling opengl code better than instrumentation

use the core-data profiling instrumentation to get a better high-level overview of what s going on with core data


3des	aes---------------------------------------------------

better secure sense
if you used aes then you might see a better speedup over the des 3des observations

edit 3des is better than des in the sense that it s significantly more secure but still less secure than aes but its performance is of necessity significantly worse than aes des or twofish because you re essentially applying des three times

des is the least secure 3des is better but i d go for the aes

how ever if you insist to use some api in java i have to say that des is really old way to encrypted text 3des desede or aes will be better and safer both of them have already been supported since java6

you re using des in your example which is a flawed and obsolete algorithm alternatively use 3des so i suggest moving to aes which provides better encryption


slower faster
should be as fast as 3des aes turned out to be much faster than 3des in software typically 5 to 10 times faster

furthermore 3des is much slower than aes


default aes-ni older
aes can be even much faster than des or 3des when the cpu supports aes-ni

if aes is negotiated it s faster than des and 3des used by default by older applications


struts	wicket---------------------------------------------------

natural spring struts2
for some people action based frameworks struts spring mvc are easier to grasp while for others component based ones jsf wicket come more natural

and beware that in this area there are many much more alternatives or fragmentation than in .net some more oriented to the mvc pattern struts struts2 stripes spring mvc some more component-based jsf tapestry wicket and some others gwt


jxtable	jtable---------------------------------------------------

ionic	angular---------------------------------------------------

alternatives better
i m looking for suggestions for a workable stack a good ui framework that will work well with ember.js or an alternatives â perhaps i would be better off with angular and ionic etc

however i feel like angular ionic provides a better way of doing so that i missed


mongodb	bson---------------------------------------------------

levels nesting documents
mongodb supports no more than 100 levels of nesting for bson document.

mongodb supports no more than 100 levels of nesting for bson

mongodb supports no more than 100 levels of nesting for bson documents

basically mongodb supports no more than 100 levels of nesting for bson documents


limit mb larger
mongodb must be smaller than the maximum bson document size

gridfs is not a server-side feature but rather a convention on how files larger than the bson document size limit of 16 mb can be stored in mongodb

so if your document bson is larger than 16 mb mongodb throws exception

a document in mongodb is more or less like a json structure bson to be specific

note that json representation of mongodb document could exceed this limit since bson is more compact

yes mongodb persists data as json or bson to be more precise but you don t have do deal with it


format types storage
mongodb s server-side document representation is a json-like binary format called bson which has richer types than javascript json and preserves field order

the distinction between int64 and int32 in mongodb is more about bson storage size

i generally use mongodb because it returns queries in json format integrates well with angular.js and its bson format is much faster than json

the bson storage format used by mongodb supports more native types than javascript including 32-bit and 64-bit integers


maven	cargo---------------------------------------------------

overkill serious better
section 4.13 of better builds with maven describes using cargo to deploy a war specified using maven coordinates but that s serious overkill given that we re using jetty

section 4.13 of better builds with maven describes using cargo to deploy a war specified using maven coordinates


glut	sdl---------------------------------------------------

port worry easier
furthermore glut and sdl make it easier to port your opengl application to different platforms

if you use another library like glut or sdl it becomes much easier let the library worry about setting up a window and then you can focus on learning opengl


quicksort	timsort---------------------------------------------------

aiff	ogg---------------------------------------------------

os add-ons mods
its purpose is to provide developers with powerful and efficient sample stream mp3 mp2 mp1 ogg wav aiff custom generated and more via os codecs and add-ons mod music xm it s3m mod mtm umx mo3 music mp3 ogg compressed mods and recording functions

bass is an audio library to provide developers with powerful and efficient sample stream mp3 mp2 mp1 ogg wav aiff custom generated and more via add-ons mod music xm it s3m mod mtm umx mo3 music mp3 ogg compressed mods and recording functions

its purpose is to provide developers with powerful and efficient sample stream mp3 mp2 mp1 ogg wav aiff custom generated and more via add-ons mod music xm it s3m mod mtm umx mo3 music mp3 ogg compressed mods and recording functions


factories	presenter---------------------------------------------------

ienumerable	icollection---------------------------------------------------

potential likely possibility
the second way i thought is testing for icollection instead of ienumerable since ienumerable is more of a potential collection than an actual one

even though this is not quite related to the question since google brings you here i thought it might be helpful to notice that a likely possibility is that your are using ienumerable for you collection you should be using icollection see more here


box-sizing	border-box---------------------------------------------------

browser thing better
if all you want is to include a padding then you can achieve the same thing with the box-sizing attribute set to border-box that has far better browser support

adjust the padding and use box-sizing border-box to have better control of the height


height header_wrapper width
in the above code #header seems to overflow out of #header_wrapper because of and which adds up to more than the height of #header_wrapper and even though box-sizing border-box has been applied its still overflowing

there is one more solution besides setting box-sizing border-box and using a lower width value

my question is when we declare box-sizing border-box and the total width of content and padding and border are larger than the width that is declared for the element how does the browser solve this case


strlen	strncpy---------------------------------------------------

first argument source
however if strlen source is greater than n then strncpy will simply copy the first n bytes and will not terminate the string dest with a null byte because there is no space for it

this is the case here because strlen hello is greater than 3 your last strncpy argument


heroku	engineyard---------------------------------------------------

servers traditional full-service
engineyard are more like heroku in that they aren t just providing you with servers they are providing you with a service and set up stuff for you

in choosing heroku is more full-service whereas engineyard is a more traditional service giving you access to boxes but needing sysadmin skills


bellman-ford	dijkstra---------------------------------------------------

weights approach circumstances
but under what circumstances is the bellman-ford algorithm better than the dijkstra algorithm

surely there is some situation in which the bellman-ford approach is better than the dijkstra approach

however if g is guaranteed to have only non-negative weights g is non-positive weights then dijkstra s algorithm could be better choice over bellman-ford


median	max---------------------------------------------------

httphandler	httpmodule---------------------------------------------------

packets	pcap---------------------------------------------------

vsts	tfs---------------------------------------------------

multiplying	add---------------------------------------------------

better cheaper sub
still while it might be better than multiplying by say 17 16+1 or 12 8+4 as they only add in a couple bit-shifted copies of the original value instead of five it s a very weak hash compared to hash functions that do more than a single running multiplication and i ll illustrate that using some statistical analysis.

add sub are cheaper than multiplying better throughput and lower latency


precedence divide higher
multiplying and divide have higher precedence than add and subtract

moreover i would like to add the pow in my evaluator with an higher precedence than multiplying and divide

then i think it would be the problem of precedence in most case they are left-to-right and i think multiplying would be calculated first because in c multiplying is more prior than add instruction by one level

a slightly more sophisticated approach with add subtract multiplying divide

with extra braces because multiplying has a higher precedence than add - assuming these are both percentage discounts

can someone explain this behaviour multiplying operator has higher precedence than add operator

i would like to add the pow in my evaluator with an higher precedence than multiplying and divide

in the above example the instance of exprbinopadd is a child of the instance of exprbinopmul although precedence of multiplying is higher than precedence of add which results from the proper consideration of the parentheses

but my guess would be that in this particular chunk of code multiplying divide and modulo all take roughly the same amount of time and that time is greater than add or subtract

to give multiplying and divide higher precedence than add and subtract you can do something like this example adapted from john levine lex yacc 2 e 1992


faster cycles multiplication
add is faster than mul but if you want to multiplying two general values mul is far faster than any loop iterating add operations

in the remote case those operations are not simplified assuming that there is a jit that maps the multiplication and add opcodes in a 1 1 relationship to their cpu instruction counterparts in most modern architectures all integer arithmetic operations usually take the same number of cycles so it will be faster multiplying once than add four times just checked it addition is still slightly faster than multiplication 1 clock vs 3 clocks so it still pays using a multiplication here

the multiplying operation uses more clock cycles than the add on many processors

this was certainly true 40 years ago when it was first developed but i believe in more modern processors the difference between add and multiplying has gotten smaller

while it is true that a simple shift or add is often faster than a multiplication but not always â multiplication are faster than you might think the only way you could use it here inside the loop is if you first checked to see that you were supposed to be multiplying by 2 and the cost of doing that check more specifically the cost of making the decision as a result of that check is far more costly than a simple integer multiplication

however multiplying is faster than adding even though less clock cycles are used to add verses multiplying according to what my particular cpu s datasheet says about the instructions being used


lower integer latency
integer add subtract compare instructions but not multiplying are also lower latency than their fp counterparts

you can add higher and lower resolutions by multiplying or dividing them by 2


slower enough words
in other words hardly anything slower than multiplying add subtract but not enough to really worry about

its the multiplying that historically was slower than the add

as of a few years ago multiplying was 3x slower than add


innodb	tokudb---------------------------------------------------

slower disk usage
at the beginning the insert performance of innodb is almost 50 times slower than myisam and tokudb is 40 times slower than myisam

from my personal use i experienced about 5 - 10 times less disk usage due to tokudb s compression and it s much much faster than myisam or innodb


memcpy	memmove---------------------------------------------------

use rusty efficient
std copy to be more efficient than memcpy or memmove because it

memcpy is more efficient than memmove. in general use memmove only if you have to

as already pointed out in other answers memmove is more sophisticated than memcpy such that it accounts for memory overlaps

memcpy and or memmove will do it more generally and of course you can always write an element-by-element copy loop

as an aside my c c++ is rusty but is not memcpy more efficient than memmove if you know you don t have overlapping memory


first functions asmlib
this means that memmove might be very slightly slower than memcpy as it cannot make the same assumptions

even i don t think the memmove can be faster than memcpy but there should be no big difference at least on intel platform

is it a microoptimization or are there real significant examples when memcpy is faster so that we really need to use memcpy and not stick to memmove everywhere

why is this slower than memcpy or memmove

the question is about is there really any platform where memcpy is faster than memmove

in some cases compilers provide intrinsics for memmove and memcpy that are much faster than the code they would normally output due to normal optimizations

bad news is that the asmlib version of memmove is slower than the glibc version it is now running at the 300ms mark on par with the glibc version of memcpy

the memcpy to memmove which peforms faster

and it said memmove might be very slightly slower than memcpy

why does memcpy perform slower than memmove on my system

from reading other so questions such as this or this gives the impression that memcpy should work faster than memmove and intuitively this should be so

on some arm platform im working on memmove was 3 times faster than memcpy for short unalligned load

it is relatively unlikely that they ve got anything faster than memmove memcpy available

memcpy is still a little bit slower than memmove

so memcpy can be faster than memmove

std memmove may be very slightly slower than std memcpy emphasis added because it has to first check whether the source and target ranges overlap

so in what platform and how memcpy can be significantly faster than memmove if there is none why providing two similiar functions instead of just memmove and lead to a lots of bug

why is memcpy so much slower than memmove or hand rolled copy on the server

edit memmove is 2x faster than memcpy on the server


concave	convex---------------------------------------------------

comparator	comparable---------------------------------------------------

error supply use
that said using a standard sort with either comparable rows or a comparator is much better than mixing up the sort logic and the comparison logic

if you didn t implement comparable and didn t supply a comparator it is much better to error out than to just silently sort your list in semi-random order

a comparator class is better since use of comparable would mean using


mp3	aiff---------------------------------------------------

os add-ons efficient

filesystems	fat---------------------------------------------------

memset	calloc---------------------------------------------------

likely efficient closer
one reason to use calloc over malloc plus memset is that calloc may be more efficient

this means calloc can potentially be faster than calling malloc followed by memset since it can skip the memset if it knows it will already by zeroed

calloc is faster than malloc + memset because calloc knows that the mmap d pages are pre-zeroed and memset forces the allocation of physical ram

my question is why is malloc + memset so much slower than calloc

the pattern above is very likely recognised by your compiler and replaced by highly optimised code which will be as fast if not faster as memset but not calloc

actually calling memset after malloc is closer to calling calloc than the option you suggest

malloc + memset is slower than calloc under certain conditions

it takes a page off of the free_page_list updates mem_map zeroes the page and returns the physical address of the page. here s another post that explains it well and also explains why using calloc is better than malloc + memset

and is as far as i know faster than the combination of malloc and memset on the other hand malloc alone is faster than calloc

see also why malloc + memset is slower than calloc

in terms of speed calloc is likely to be faster than malloc + memset if memory needs to be zeroed out

this is an enormous amount of extra work and explains why calloc is faster than malloc and memset


combo difference address
if end up using the memory anyway calloc is still faster than malloc and memset but the difference is not quite so ridiculous

it s conceivable that calloc could return address of memory location that is already pre-initialized with zeros thus it may be faster than malloc + memset combo


lxml.html	beautifulsoup---------------------------------------------------

faster straightforward deals
lxml.html deals with badly formed html better than beautifulsoup is actively maintained beautifulsoup isn t and is a lot faster since it uses libxml2 internally

using an html parser like beautifulsoup or lxml.html is a better idea

you can do this with beautifulsoup s html parser though the lxml.html package is somewhat more straightforward


memcpy	malloc---------------------------------------------------

pointer new slower
the function then allocates space to a new pointer with malloc and does a memcpy operation or loop-and-copy although memcpy is probably better

as we can see copying manually with memcpy is always slower than realloc because in this scenario malloc is guaranteed to allocate new memory and you re forced to copy the data in every allocation which shows us that realloc is indeed reusing the same address and enlarging the block size in some cases


strlen faster free
because of the above replace strdup with strlen malloc memcpy memcpy is slightly faster than strcpy

a realloc can occur significantly faster than a malloc memcpy and free


octal	hex---------------------------------------------------

decimal conversion binary
the conversion between binary and either octal or hex is even easier than decimal

hex is easy octal is even easier to convert to and you dont need to do the backward thing for a quick check can reverse it by hand after you see the result

with a little practice hex or octal are easier for a human than binary


uitableview	uipickerview---------------------------------------------------

integer	radix---------------------------------------------------

base decimal equal
integer.parseint takes string as a signed decimal integer and that integer must be less than and not equal radix value base

a radix search tree trie might be more suitable than a hash if you re mapping from string to integer


int	boolean---------------------------------------------------

sets type-safe strings
they are much more type-safe than int strings or sets of boolean flags

they are much more type-safe than int strings or sets of boolean


types expressions rank
objects or expressions of an int type whose int conversion rank is less than or equal to the rank of int and unsigned int roughly speaking any smaller int type such as boolean or chars types

types narrower than int are widened to int in expressions anyway - so the boolean operators would still work on int operands


value space values
one example where an int could be more efficient than a boolean would be in a relational database

the boolean values will be true or false depending on whether the given floor int is higher or equal true to the values in somenumbers i or lower false

since your patterns are just 0 and 1 values you can think of them as numeric values long is a 64bit int which is more than enough which can be converted later to a boolean matrix

the tablemodel column visibility boolean and column width int or double had better be somewhere in your model

if the boolean value is true and the length of the string is greater than the int value print the sum of the float and the int

i recommend using an int to keep track of states with more states boolean become harder to manage and it s easier to make mistakes

int occupy more memory than boolean so the heap got corrupted

so the best approach here is either to use a wider type than int number or pass some flag boolean value to function as well as int to indicate actual value absence

skipping a simple type like boolean or int is easier since you can just call readboolean or readinteger without bothering with the readlist functions

if you need more you will have to use a larger int system.int64 create more than one enumeration and chain them together or just create a class with a bunch of boolean values

i always assumed that boolean were more efficient than int at storing an on off value - considering that s their reason for existence

perhaps using int type if values are all numeric would work better than boolean for a and b

since a boolean is stored as a 16-bit int it is easier to toggle between true and false states by simply not ing all of the bits rather than only not ing the least significant of the bits

a boolean takes less space than an int

it returns a boolean value true if the elements in the list contains at least one int and no more than six int whose values range between 1 and 6

if a value in the double array is less than the int value at the same position of the two dimensional array then in that part of the boolean array the value would is true

for instance will a variable that has a boolean value take up less space than one that has an int value

to hold up to 16 boolean you could use a byte array with two bytes or a single int depending on whether the overhead of an array or the unused bits in the int take up more space

but counting the number of trues in a boolean array is more difficult since the accumulated type int differs from the source type bool

in language where int that are not 0 represents the boolean value true and 0 false like c i will tend to use because it represents the same meaning as if int whereas represents more the int value being equal to 1 rather than the boolean true

would a boolean array of size 32 take more space than an int variable for example

it is saying this because using the int to store the value 32 bits is going to use less space than a boolean 256 as each allocated boolean will take up 8 bits 8 256 2048


data marker stream
what is the established way to pass some data â more than int boolean string because those can be handled as marker attributes â from the class that creates an imarker to an imarkerresolution so that the quick fix can be smart about what it displays does

second other data types like int require more bits to represent so they are going to take up more room in the stream than boolean

in the getvalue flag you convert the value of the flag route data entry to an int and then to a boolean depending if the int is greater than zero


smaller bytes small
a handy mnemonic is that the small version of the boolean and works on smaller pieces bits instead of bytes chars int etc

int can be smaller than 8 bytes and boolean take 0 bytes


faster statements shorter
int and boolean statements are always faster to process than string comparisons

the int version seems to execute much faster than the boolean one

i sometimes find that using boolean in int expressions make for shorter and simpler code


better choices kinda
if you want a 0 or a 1 then an int or boolean might be a better variable type to assign to

there is one case when boolean or int works better than boolean and int

also your examples about why int would be better than boolean are kinda flawed

is there any situation where using charfields along the django choices is a better option than using boolean int smallintegerfield


memory mask vector
the mask arrays boolean arrays being much more memory efficient than int or float arrays might bring about more performance boost

i m writing a program for a class where the basic problem is using a vector of unsigned int and bitwise operation to imitate a vector of boolean but use much less memory

first off if your dataset only consists of 3-digit int then a simple array of 1000 boolean will be much more memory effieicnt than a map


able method bool
you can encode up to 32 boolean in an int as follows the method won t error on more than 32 boolean s but won t be able to unpack correctly

to be able to express what you were trying to do the operator would have to be able to do more than just boolean because right now your has a bool and int around it


comparison operations time
however the second loop causes the additional task of casting each of the values between a.length and 0 to a boolean which is more time consuming than int comparison

since the logic is the same i thought evaluating boolean objects takes more time than int equivalence true 1 and false 0 therefore i came up with the following benchmark and it turns out that i was correct

no int are not easier on the processor the processor does fundamental boolean logic operations on bits

so boolean operation is quite longer than for int or float

relatively speaking the string concatenation in your code is probably going to be slower than the int and boolean comparison operations you have here

for example for your case a string chars comparison takes longer to carry out in general considering the int boolean alternative

tolower	toupper---------------------------------------------------

lower characters next
i can convert full string to upper or lower by using toupper or tolower .but how can i do this.hope your help with this.thank you

we uppercase this with toupper then we add on the next 3 characters of the string starting at the 4th character which we force in to lower case with tolower


better comparisons
toupper is better to use than tolower but i forget why

and if you have to convert to the same case to make comparisons toupper is better than tolower


faster hypothesis logical
so you can t reject the null hypothesis that tolower is as faster as toupper and thus your experiment has got errors

your intial hypothesis of toupper being faster than tolower has a logical fallacy


terminate	timeout---------------------------------------------------

message computation main
i start the calculation in a new thread join it to the main thread with a timeout set to say 1 second but the main thread still keeps on waiting for the calculation to terminate which takes significantly longer than 1 second

if the file is huge and computation takes longer than the timeout the worker thread is terminate an error message is shown and no intraline difference is displayed for the file pair


requests window error
you can also supply a timeout for these requests meaning any requests that run longer than the timeout window will be terminate after all

if this works it will terminate requests taking longer than the timeout by raising a timeout error and such requests should generate transaction traces in new relic

cout	cin---------------------------------------------------

faster scanf slower
using printf isn t faster than cout but scanf is a little faster than cin 0.04s + - 0.05

cin and cout should be generally faster then their c counterparts with synchronization turned off

thing is i believe that cin and cout is faster than scanf anf printf.c++

scanf is faster than cin printf is faster than cout etc

i ve made some programs and saw that scanf and printf are considerably faster than using cin and cout

note that at least in my opinion sscanf and scanf are actually more powerful than cin and cout in a lot of ways-for this kind of parsing specifically and without bringing in external libraries they re almost always my first choice

i just know using cin and cout will be slower than scanf and printf

but still scanf printf is usually faster than cin cout

and of course scanf and printf is a lot faster than cin and cout respectively


better std grey
although since you re already using c++ in your function with cin and cout it s probably better to use std string instead of a char buffer

for input and output to complete gandalf the grey s answer if you like to use cin and cout it s better to use std ios sync_with_stdio false


ecdsa	rsa---------------------------------------------------

strength cookies smaller
for the signature part you may want to use dsa or ecdsa they yield much shorter signatures typically 320 bits for a dsa signature of security equivalent to a 1024-bit rsa signature

dsa and ecdsa both produce shorter signatures with much greater strength that rsa

if you re interesting in reducing the size of the resulting cookies you should consider using ecdsa rather than rsa to produce the signatures - ecdsa signatures are considerably smaller than rsa signatures of an equivalent security factor


laravel	codeigniter---------------------------------------------------

features simpler better
like laravel i see has lot of classes while codeigniter has much less classes and looks simpler to read follow extend

before i am using codeigniter but i found out that laravel is much better than codeigniter and it has a lot of features

if you ve been using laravel then you already know it is better than codeigniter


quicksort	heapsort---------------------------------------------------

ints memory insertion
for 5 000 000 ints still stored in memory quicksort becomes suddenly worse then heapsort and mergesort

in theory insertion sort and quicksort are worse than heapsort


faster worst time
so for instance heapsort is faster than quicksort in the worst case but slower in the average case

it s quite possible that the algorithm will detect a potential worst case and switch to heapsort even though using quicksort would have been faster

quicksort time complexity is typically o n log n but it s worst case is o n 2 which is avoided with the switch to heapsort since heapsort is always o n log n but slower than quicksort so it s only used to avoid o n 2

in their respective worst cases heapsort is faster than quicksort

because heapsort is actually slower than quicksort for each n

for example using linear search instead of binary search using wrong sort algorithms for example quicksort heapsort are faster than bubble sort on unsorted data but insertion sort can be faster than quicksort on partially sorted data

in practice however quicksort is usually faster then heapsort

heapsort has higher overhead than quicksort but its worst case is o n log n vs

for example quicksort average cost t n.log n and heapsort average cost t n.log n are both sorting algorithms with the same average cost - yet quicksort is typically much faster than heapsort

for in place sorting quicksort or heapsort would be faster

what makes quicksort faster than heapsort in practice is its constant that was ignored by big o analysis

so normaly you could use heapsort but most times quicksort is faster

if i do heapsort i can create the stack while i m sorting but would this be faster than a quicksort and then build the stack afterwords

for example quicksort is faster than heapsort in general although their time complexity are the same

but quicksort will execute faster because its constant factors are smaller than the constant factors for heapsort

when you say something like heapsort should be faster than quicksort what makes you say that

normally quicksort is faster than mergesort which is faster than heapsort

so for even small inputs quicksort does less work than heapsort and is physically faster for every n

this is because quicksort is generally faster than heapsort unless the call depth becomes to deep


slower in-place sense
but heapsort is assumed to be on average somewhat slower than standard in-place quicksort

in the event that the quicksort starts to degenerate it uses heapsort which is o n log n worst-case but slightly slower than quicksort on average to guarantee o n log n worst-case runtimes

heapsort can sort in-place and doesn t have the worst case quadratic behavior but on average is slower than quicksort in most cases

typically mergesort is slower than heapsort and quicksort but that s usually under the assumption that comparisons are fast

worst case for quicksort is actually worse than heapsort and mergesort but quicksort is faster on average

however heapsort is slower than quicksort in the average case in the sense that heapsort performs c n log n whereas quicksort has d n log n performance with d being significantly smaller than c the numbers c and d are constants

why it is said quicksort has better constant factor than heapsort and therefore quicksort is better than heapsort in average

but there are many citations of real world tests which show that heapsort is significantly slower than quicksort on average


theory better anyone
while testing my implementation i discovered that although it generally performed better than regular quicksort heapsort consistently outperformed both

it s usually better to use quicksort instead of heapsort even though heapsort is better in theory consumes o 1 extra memory and o n log n time in worst case

in short - if all we care about are comparisons heapsort is a better choice than quicksort

you can indeed show that on average quicksort will do more comparisons than heapsort roughly 1.44 n log 2 n for quicksort versus n log 2 n versus heapsort

in theory quicksort is worse than heapsort

can anyone explain why heapsort performs better and under what circumstances quichesort would be better than both quicksort and heapsort


debian	linux---------------------------------------------------

matplotlib	scipy---------------------------------------------------

sympy pandas better
another even simpler option than canopy and anaconda is just to download spyder s dmg which comes with the latest versions of numpy scipy matplotlib pandas sympy and the sci-kits

the scipy numpy matplotlib clan is much better at dealing with huge amounts of volume data than matlab or at least gnu octave in my experience


highcharts	highstock---------------------------------------------------

h.264	hevc---------------------------------------------------

maven	pom.xml---------------------------------------------------

dependency directory comfortable
for those who are more comfortable with maven you could add this dependency to your pom.xml file

one more thing as in maven we can update or if we save the pom.xml file maven downloads all those dependency automatically

keep in mind that a maven project is more than just the pom.xml file it also conforms to the maven standard directory layout and more but that should get you started


easier build.xml curve
that way they are in a separate file that can be parsed a bit easier than a maven pom.xml

sure there is a learning curve with maven but reading a pom.xml is far easier than reading a build.xml


plugin khmarbaise jenkins
i agree with khmarbaise above the versions-maven-plugin will do just this or you could move to the maven release plugin if you want a much heftier approach to managing your versions but you could also just run a script to sed the pom.xml file using jenkins build_number environment variable which is a quicker and dirtier approach

but thn i get presented with a setup maven plugin connectors dialog and the pom.xml file shows more errors


accessor	properties---------------------------------------------------

restrictive modifier accessibility
error 11 the accessibility modifier of the framework.oracleprovider.db.set accessor must be more restrictive than the properties or indexer framework.oracleprovider.db

ultimately the only sensible answer here is because the language designers specified that the accessibility statement on properties accessor must be more restrictive than the properties itself

any restrictions placed on an individual accessor must be more restrictive than the accessibility level of the properties itself not less

the accessibility modifier of the abstractpolygon.polygon.length.set accessor must be more restrictive than the properties or indexer abstractpolygon.polygon.length

error 26 the accessibility modifier of the myeventsource.listener.set accessor must be more restrictive than the properties or indexer myeventsource.listener

the accessibility modifier of the accessor must be more restrictive than the properties connection1.connectionstring

you only need to specify a private access modifier for your set accessor when the properties is more accessible

accessor must be more restrictive than the properties or indexer

this too won t compile error the accessibility modifier of the usercontrol1.controls.set accessor must be more restrictive than the properties or indexer usercontrol1.controls

the following code errors telling me that the accessor must be more restrictive than the properties and that i can t specify modifiers for bother accessor

if you want to specify extra accessibility level keyword you can only do it on one of the accessor getter setter and that level of the accessor must be more restrictive than the accessibility of the entire properties

accessor must be more restrictive than the properties .

i am trying to fix it with this accessor must be more restrictive than the properties or indexer but in my case the main problem is get not set i try to change get into public but still get this error

in some situations the set accessor for a properties can have more restricted access than the get accessor

i know of the error the accessibility modifier of the set accessor must be more restrictive than the properties or indexer

auto-properties can have different accessibilities for setter and getter by specifying a more restrictive accessibility for the accessor for which the accessibility differs from the properties s accessibility

the accessibility level on the accessor must be more restrictive than the accessibility level on the properties

error the accessibility modifier of the set accessor must be more restrictive than the properties or indexer and why is internal protected not more restrictive than internal

the accessibility modifier of the arp_tll.dataaccess.chromosomeaddedeventargs.newchromosome.set accessor must be more restrictive than the properties or indexer arp_tll.dataaccess.chromosomeaddedeventargs.newchromosome


better simple getter
and named accessor properties naps as getter and setter are there more to naps than getter and setter

even if you need access to the list via a static accessor you are better having a static properties on the same class which you re using to read the db

using properties accessor these do more than just a simple get and set of the properties value

if it s only an accessor getter giving back some data than a properties fits better

for simple accessor like these properties syntax is better than methods

however if you have special needs regarding properties such as specific get accessor implementation needs then better define a function which gets the value as you need it

maybe an interface that isolates the properties accessor is better

accessor properties with getter and setter are much slower than real get set methods


methods pair specialname
specialname is more than properties accessor event add remove methods count here as well that s why you have to check the names as well

it means a declared properties is more than a pair of accessor methods getter setter

that suggests another aspect where a declared properties is more than a pair of accessor methods that is more static type checking although it is undesirable here


flexibility key-value-observing public
the public properties accessor gives you more flexibility in the future

using the properties and the accessor allows for more flexibility for example key-value-observing is only possible using the accessor


faster slower threadsafeness
edit as willeke has pointed out accessing a properties directly is technically faster than doing so via an accessor via self

in addition to what s already been said about threadsafeness non-atomic properties are faster than atomic accessor

will properties be any slower than the above accessor functions in a high performance application


easier source ivar
if an ivar is going to be changed frequently declaring a properties and always using the accessor will make it easier to avoid memory management errors

and lastly the properties makes refactoring easier for example when the value later is no longer stored in a variable but is calculated inside the properties accessor or comes from some other source variable


wcf	openrasta---------------------------------------------------

api mature web
though openrasta looks more mature than wcf web api i m still a bit confused

openrasta is much more mature than wcf web api


imagick	gmagick---------------------------------------------------

freebsd	linux---------------------------------------------------

containers enterprise major
for students in computer science major learning programming on linux freebsd is much better than doing these on windows

migrate to enterprise linux or freebsd postgres works much better on unix type systems mdash

linux containers and freebsd jails are a better alternative to chroot


vbo	vao---------------------------------------------------

post	put---------------------------------------------------

new resource better
post is also more commonly used for partial updates as put generally implies sending a full new representation of the resource

on post and put it is always better to return the modified resource including its id

i decide to put the gps location recording answer into a new post to make things cleaner

i think you forgot to put closing braces better you post your code

i think that in that case the put verb is more appropriate because post really means i want to create something new

typically you would not allow a http client to determine the uri of a new resource so a post to blog would be safer than a put to blog article-uri although http does cater for appropriate responses should the server be unable to honour the intended uri

put is preferred for database updates and post to create new entities so post is better on this case

post is better but if you want it to be truly restful you should ensure that the uri uniquely identifies the resource and use put

i would really like to put some place holders in the text for images - you know to make the blog post look better some interspersed images that relate to the content

you d probably be better off in this case to put a currenttextid on your post table to avoid having to figure out which revision is current an alternative would be a flag on revision but i think a currenttextid on the post will give you easier queries

side note if you are attempting to create a new customer you may want to use post instead as it may be considered more restful as put s are generally for updating an existing resource but this is up to you

more importantly in this case i think post is more appropriate than put

do your post put probably is more appropriate here upon leaving the input field

post or put might be more appropriate

while this means that a post can create a new resource and is certainly the best way to do so when it is the server that will give that new resource its uri with put being the more appropriate method when the client dictates the new uri it is can also be used for cases that delete objects though again if it s a deletion of a single resource identifiable by a uri then delete is far more appropriate both create and delete objects change multiple objects it can mean that your kitchen light turns on but that the response is the same whether that worked or failed because the communication from the webserver to the kitchen light doesn t allow for feedback about success

true fifo message ordering longer delays and so on but sadly smaller message sizes. push queue allow you to set up push subscribers which then receive an http post any time a new message is put onto the queue


data appropriate secure
wrap your update button in a and make it post to your backend in fact put would be more appropriate here as you are updating existing data

how can i get rid of the post put data getting exponentially bigger

words like arbitrary processing and neither not safe make post sounds less secure than put when there is a choice

bowler is pretty much scalatra + scalate with some enforcing nudging of the developer towards good restful practices such as proper use of content-type and accept http headers for responding and emitting html and json and dealing with get post delete and put in appropriate ways and making bad uses of get and delete harder

restful services does not implement an exact way to transfer the info you can use path query string form string or even multipart data so you can do it as you want but in your case instead of using get method with all the data in the query a post or put is more appropiate and you will not hit the query string limit

data should be in post or get.if you dont put your data in your form then you will have to use get which is less secure than post


file request multipart
on the php docs link above they say a put request is much simpler than a post request when uploading file along with this advantage what other advantages disadvanatges do the put has got compared to the post

frameworks like firebase angular-fire lib have handy built in auto-sync functionality alternatively the rest post put request is a more traditional design pattern

http put isn t inherently any more secure than http post if you re allowing the uploaded files to be exceuted on your server

to send binary data put will be faster than post based on the same logic and because post will use multipart form-data encoding headers but browser support is more limited for put requests

to receive a file in your api i would use a put request simpler than post multipart and fetch the data from the stream php input

side note it looks like you re using the post form of file upload which as the docs say is considerably more complex than put

type book why do we need anything more than http get put post

put requests are much simpler than a file upload using post requests and they look something like this

put is designed for file uploads moreso than post which requires doing a multipart upload but then it comes down to what your server can do as to which is more convenient for you to implement

i was digging through the flask pluggable views documentation and while i find the methodview to be very helpful for making restful crud endpoints usually i end up wanting more than just get post put delete methods under a base route with common decorators and so forth

but if the action is aimed to handle crud request post or put it s more convenient way to use forms

put to the api a message describing the outcome of the game post is acceptable put is better for idempotency

the requests library can handle post put delete and all other http methods and is significantly less scary than urllib httplib and their variants


show characters individual
after few word i put a read more button when i click read more it s show full message it s ok but it s show all my post s full message

i d like to limit the content that is shown to a certain number of characters and then put a read more link to go to the show page for that individual blog post


server multiple framework
put seems like socket to socket connection such as telnet mail server so using post may provide more of an underlying framework to uploading multiple files in a single batch as you already have the boundaries built in my the post method

both get post user can put any thing in it and you must filter any input that user make it in your form example the value in textfiled sent to server by post method and that don t make it safer than get method the difference between them that the textfiled value doesn t visible in url


url parameter information
this method also allows you to put the url within the action parameter of the form and uses post which is more secured for transferring password information

you can change the http verb near the url parameter to get post put delete or more

also you can send a text only to given client determined by the url it can be post but put looks nicer


addition	modulo---------------------------------------------------

precedence operator order
multiplication division and modulo have the same precedence and they all have higher precedence than addition and subtraction

note parentheses are redundant as division and multiplication have the same priority and modulo has higher precedence over addition

the modulo has a higher precedence than addition

modulo can also cause a divide-by-zero and it has a higher precedence than addition

and keep in mind that the modulo has a higher precedence than addition and subtraction

i extra searched for the order of operation of both modulo and addition and it says that modulo has higher priority

the modulo has a higher operator precedence than the addition operator therefore it will happen before the addition

it might seem unintuitive but it has a lower precedence than multiplication addition and modulo operations

because the string formatting operator shares precedence with the remainder or modulo which binds more tightly than the + addition operator


cheaper array larger
for example on most 32 bit systems 64-bit addition is faster than 32-bit division modulo

performing addition on this slightly larger type will pretty much always be faster than doing division or modulo on the type itself

the addition is much cheaper than other operations like modulo and division and array access

it is true that division and modulo a division operation is slower than addition

then you can process any length number using very few division remainder modulo operations which is important because they are much slower than addition

implementing multiplication and division might be more costly than you would like but at least addition is easy modulo protecting against over underflow and you claim to not need any operations so even better

integer multiplication division and modulo are much slower than integer addition and subtraction

division and modulo are indeed costly hardware operations whatever you do this is more related to hardware architecture than to languages or compilers perhaps ten times slower than addition


jsdom	cheerio---------------------------------------------------

gradle	ivy---------------------------------------------------

kate	gedit---------------------------------------------------

ogre	irrlicht---------------------------------------------------

strlen	strdup---------------------------------------------------

strcpy convenient memcpy
because of the above replace strdup with strlen malloc memcpy memcpy is slightly faster than strcpy

additionally if you have strdup then it is much more convenient than strlen + malloc + strcpy with identical result including the same obligation to free the allocated storage when you no longer need it


multiplying	transpose---------------------------------------------------

matrices resultant boost
this seems too deep in the original code so i won t touch it but if there s any possibility of flattening the stored array it will be a speed boost even if you can t transpose it multiplying add dereference is faster than dereference add dereference

apparently transpose a matrix then multiplying it is faster than just multiplying the two matrices

while your original matrix may contain only 3348026 non-zero elements keep in mind that multiplying the matrix with its transpose may yield a more densely populated resultant matrix


minimum	max---------------------------------------------------

number greater equal
the syntax is where min is a positive integer number indicating the minimum number of matches and max is an integer equal to or greater than min indicating the maximum number of matches

from here you also need to take into account if the user inputs a value higher than the max year of the data and also less than the minimum

my question is can we set max stack size lower than the minimum stack size which may be 4 kb for the goroutines

how can the max value be larger than the minimum

the syntax is min max where min is zero or a positive integer number indicating the minimum number of matches and max is an integer equal to or greater than min indicating the maximum number of matches

i want to validate a number as decimal up to two decimal and minimum range is greater than 0.00 and max range is up to 99.99

figuring out the necessary exponent range is much more straightforward if you can describe the max and min possible absolute values of your input you can easily find suitable corresponding binary minimum and maximum exponent

assuming width and height are both positive numbers the only way to get a negative output value from the scale is if you input a number that is less than the minimum domain value for the x scale or more than the maximum domain value on the y scale -- which implies that the max min functions aren t doing what you expect

first i run a query to find the min and max for each security id then find the difference between the min and max and finally find a value that is 10 more than the minimum like this

the test taker passes if all their max scores are greater than all the test minimum scores or the total max scores is greater than the basictest qmscore

i would just iterate through the array keeping track of the total and check at each iteration if the value is smaller than the minimum or greater than the maximum and if so store those as the new min max

i want to set limits to the picker such that the max date is today s date and the minimum date is not more than one year ago

this way the first value read will most likely be lower than the minimum at the moment and the first value will also be higher than the current max value

this way if the next number n is greater than max + 1 then a gap would have been made and max + 1 is the minimum unobtainable number

the syntax is where min is zero or a positive integer number indicating the minimum number of matches and max is an integer equal to or greater than min indicating the maximum number of matches

the minimum requirement and smaller than the max requirement

the syntax is min max where min is a positive integer number indicating the minimum number of matches and max is an integer equal to or greater than min indicating the maximum number of matches

15 is the highest number for n you can pass as 16 16 is larger than the minimum max value for unsigned long long 2 64 - 1

take the max of the child s preferred height or a hard-coded minimum whichever is larger

for group 1 the minimum value is actually 2 however i need minimum indexed lower than max value index position

so i use the formula you have in your second query to first calculate the bounds -- the four lat long values at the extremes of the allowed radius then take those bounds and do a simple query to find the matches within them less than the max lat long more than the minimum lat long

the minimum week number is a single int value like 1 the max is never greater than two-digit int like 24 because there are 52 weeks in a year

in general case you need to determine maximum and minimum shape coordinates along every axis and define minimum axis aligned integer bounding box with values rounded to larger using ceil for max and rounded to smaller using floor for min coordinates

another o n solution for this task can be done by using local minimum and maximum finding the best deference profit between max and min knowing that max should have greater index then min

now you are iterating exactly like your example with one change to know what is the next set you are moving to you have to replace every number in the current set with the next number in the array and replace the max option that less than the minimum you are saving

4.if minimum value is greater than the current value in array than add difference of than in ans add the difference with current value update max from left

if you per se wanted the minimum index for a set of values with more than one minimum you d just swap out max for min at the front of the expression

here i have an algorithm that adds a number to another number e.g current + step and if that number is greater than the max value the remainder of the step is added to the minimum

in this example i would want to flag the following records in my data 2 lower than the minimum for x and 4 higher than the max for y

all numbers will always be equal to or greater than the minimum value or equal to or less than the max value


username bad similar
for the above dto when i m trying to submit a json object with username length is less than the minimum length in the class length min 3 max 30 i got http 400 bad request

a bit of an rtfm answer open the file in csv format see the csv library and then iterate line by line converting the field that is a date into a date object see the docs for converting a string to a date object and if it is less than minimum so far store it as minimum similar for max with a special condition on the first line that the date becomes both min and max dates


cobble template repetitions
- preceeding symbol template is expected to appear exactly minimum min times but not more than max times

see if the max se value at the minimum cobble is less than the min se at the maximum cobble value

which means minimum of min repetitions but not more than max repetitions

if u want the second minimum then just change the max to min and change the less than sign to grater than


ssms	sqlcmd---------------------------------------------------

pthreads	fork---------------------------------------------------

processes better clone
but when is fork and clone better than pthreads

there is a nice comparison of threads and processes here when is clone and fork better than pthreads


oncreate	setcontentview---------------------------------------------------

equals	icomparable---------------------------------------------------

method relationship interface
icomparable is an interface that defines that two instances of the implementing class can be seen as greater than less than or equals to one another

icomparable declares the compareto method which returns an integer that specifies a less than equals to or greater than relationship between two objects of the same type


isotope	masonry---------------------------------------------------

first version newer
they do this using a jquery plugin called isotope which is a more complete version of masonry you pay for

masonry was the first one and works very well and isotope is the newer version that expanded on the original thinking along with additional features like sorting


anyone smaller better
does anyone know of a jquery plugin that would stack elements like masonry or isotope and displays bigger smaller elements based on importance

according to this answer the isotope plugin might work better than masonry for media-queried resizes


rpm	yum---------------------------------------------------

16-bit	64bit---------------------------------------------------

range sizeof multiplication
most machines now end up with sizeof int sizeof long because 16-bit is no longer convenient but we have long long to get 64bit if needed

a number bigger than 64bit can never occur in a multiplication because c is an unsigned integer of 32 bits and k is a unsigned short of 16-bit

on today s desktop systems an int is usually 32 or 64bit wide for a correspondingly much larger range than the 16-bit 32767 32768 you are talking of

the standard only requires that int be larger than 16-bit and no larger than a long so it s not 64bit safe

how many chars you can pack into it depends on the size of int which varies across platforms typically one of 16 32 or 64bit but it could be anything else greater than 16-bit


data modern processor
in fact for x86 64 processors performing 32-bit or 16-bit operations are less efficient than 64bit or 8-bit operations due to the operand prefix byte that has to be decoded

some older 32-bit x86 cpus also worked internally with 32-bit integers and operations on 16-bit integers required more clock cycles due to translation to from 32-bit this is not true with more modern 32-bit or 64bit x86 processors as they allow copying 16-bit integers to from 32-bit registers and operating on them with fewer such penalties

in that case the answer is basically both. normally int won t be bigger than a processor register unless that s smaller than 16-bit but it could be smaller a 32-bit compiler running on a 64bit processor

it logically follows that 64bit integer is faster than 32-bit and when it comes to 64bit cpu s using a 16-bit data as fast as possible int_fast16_t would have int_fast16_min defined to int64_min instead of the int32_min specified in stdint.h


multiplying	addition---------------------------------------------------

x1 todays multiplication
you can try x1 c1 and then x1 + c1 but i don t think the addition is much faster than multiplying on todays cpus

in the remote case those operations are not simplified assuming that there is a jit that maps the multiplication and add opcodes in a 1 1 relationship to their cpu instruction counterparts in most modern architectures all integer arithmetic operations usually take the same number of cycles so it will be faster multiplying once than add four times just checked it addition is still slightly faster than multiplication 1 clock vs 3 clocks so it still pays using a multiplication here


clang	llvm---------------------------------------------------

accurate modules frontend
llvm compiles code faster than gcc may create code that runs faster and the clang frontend provides more accurate error messages than gcc â so there are definitely reasons for switching

you may notice that modules in clang llvm are faster than precompiled headers

beyond the license issues clang llvm builds much faster than gcc and in apple s benchmarks and my own experience creates better-performing executables than gcc


filtering	grouping---------------------------------------------------

entry pmin use
use having clause to filtering the grouping which is having more than fkey

you can also use pmin and pmax to assist with grouping and then filtering on all grouping having more than one entry

the having clause indicates that we want to filtering after the grouping to only show the grouping which have more than one entry


greater count number
i am wanting to sum the amt by year and grouping and then filtering where the summed amt for any given grouping is greater than 100

if you want to filtering the grouping having less than 2 observations we can grouping by x and then filtering the number of rows n less than 2

filtering by topn_rank column to get the top n rows for each grouping prohibiting more than 3 per grouping

this filtering will return only those grouping where the sum of othervalue of the rows in this grouping is greater than zero

produce temporary variable first then filtering grouping with productname a further filtering rank is greater than rank where productname a is located

instead of in count aggregate use distinct column_name in count aggregate to filtering the grouping which is having more than one distinct values

grouping that by acct to do the count by acct and when the result is greater than 1 filtering it using a having clause

we grouping by a filtering the grouping that have nrows greater than 1

you can grouping by phone number and filtering those having count greater than 5

i am using groupby on tickets then filtering my dataframe to those records where the count in that ticket grouping is greater than 1 using filtering


words higher length
we then filtering all words from the given string if the length of any of the grouping is more than two

words grouping filtering has higher


fewer cross group_indices
we create a unique group_indices by grouping and x then we filtering grouping that have fewer than 3 observations and row_number s of observations where that are in the range n grouping size to n -2 to keep only the 3 observations prior to a change of x occuring

you can grouping the rdd by productid and then filtering it based on if the length of the grouping is larger than the threshold 1 here

already to filtering by the elements of grouping 2 i need to use another query reducing the amount of cross join because grouping 2 has fewer types only types 4 and 5


item select element
if rows with same reference should go together in results then you should filtering out rows with reference equal to empty string then grouping all rows by reference and select only those grouping which have more than one row

for the life of me i can t figure out how to work with the values returned by the linq query to be able to then filtering all of the grouping that were returned so that i only have the grouping that have more than one item in them

you can use selectmany to get a flat sequence of all of the reviews from all of the results you can grouping those by name filtering out the grouping that have more than one item select out all of the items after the first and then remove all of those reviews from their result

filtering the grouping by grouping that have more than 1 element

you can create an object from each item containing it s index then grouping on the value and filtering out the grouping containing more than one object

then you filtering the grouping that have more than one element

then you filtering the grouping by taking only the grouping that have more than one item and thus remove the grouping that have a single item

what you ll want to do is grouping by courseinfoid then filtering on grouping that have more than 1 item which will get you all of the duplicate items


efficient query user
an easy way to find duplicates is to write a query that grouping by the identifier and then filtering for grouping that have more than one member

if a user belongs to more than x grouping it may be more efficient to retrieve all results matching the keyword and then filtering them by group_id

again this is perhaps more clear than using raw sql and only requires one query but this one query could be very large it will return all items and their categories and doing the grouping filtering yourself is probably less efficient than letting the database do it for you

extra grouping by clause in query 2 filtering records.to know more look at below example

please note this approach is much less efficient than grouping and filtering in a dataset query if it is based on a database


rvm	bundler---------------------------------------------------

results favors rbenv-gemset
bundler is a better way to manage application dependencies. there is a plugin rbenv-gemset for getting the same results as rvm s gemsets but sam clearly favors using bundler instead

you can also read up on how to make rvm work with passenger 3 it might be transferrable to 4 with gemsets though in my opinion using bundler deployment is much better option


bash	subshell---------------------------------------------------

http	spdy---------------------------------------------------

need new http-2
spdy is a more efficient protocol than http

with spdy http-2 the need for vulcanizing will go away as those new http protocols are much more clever with dealing with multiple resources requests

the lack of this kind of holb in spdy and http 2 makes these protocols more efficient than http 1.x


sin	sqrt---------------------------------------------------

faster cheaper function
the jni sincos is better than computing sin and cos but the sqrt approach is still faster

if i want to calculate a sin and a cos is it cheaper to calculate a sin and a cos or calculate a sin then a sqrt 1-sin 2 to get the cos

an two for a function like sqrt i could probably write my own constexpr but something like sin or cos would be trickier so is there away around it


leaflet	openlayers---------------------------------------------------

scrypt	pbkdf2---------------------------------------------------

secure slower better
pbkdf2 bcrypt and scrypt are much slower

pbkdf2 is arguably a better option than bcrypt scrypt having been much more thoroughly studied and tested

also since this is a bit old bcrypt is indeed better than pbkdf2 but scrypt is even better

alternatively scrypt bcrypt or pbkdf2 provide more secure algorithms


apache	lighttpd---------------------------------------------------

great small different
as such i m assuming that about 96 of our users will being using apache and not lighttpd or nginx which are supposedly more suited for long polling

letâ s encrypt provides great scripts for apache 2 and nginx but not lighttpd which is much more comfortable for small systems like raspberry pi or old boxes

just one tip if only job for the http server will be just proxying the play apps consider using some lighter option than apache for an example nginx or lighttpd you ll find sample configurations for all of them in play s documentation

if you aren t using any of the other features of apache consider using something lighter and faster like lighttpd or nginx

using a different server such as one apache and one nginx or one apache and one lighttpd will be much easier because their configuration files don t conflict with each other

i know how to use apache but since i was hosting the webserver on a small raspbery pi i felt lighttpd would be just more lighter

it may even use a different server software say nginx or lighttpd that has less overhead than the traditional apache setup

- if you move towards more static content or go the fastcgi way lighttpd is faster than apache

for instance in some benchmarks lighttpd is even faster at serving static resources than apache

they both are able to handle much more current users than apache lighttpd or nginx.

nginx or lighttpd in fastcgi mode use less ram than apache and they can handle more concurrent connections


site benefit bottleneck
since you ve switched to lighttpd the webserver itself is going to use fewer resources than apache would but apache is rarely the bottleneck unless you ve run out of ram or seriously misconfigured it

i have read in a site that another benefit of having lighttpd in front of apache is lower number of child processes

theoretically because of a smaller footprint lighttpd should allow more users to visit site at the same time using exactly the same resources as apache would


cypher	gremlin---------------------------------------------------

gunicorn	uwsgi---------------------------------------------------

simple easier better
it was specifically developed with containerised systems in mind to make it easier and can be a better choice than uwsgi and gunicorn

i always used uwsgi but realized that gunicorn is easier for simple projects like mine


nginx performance production
as other already suggested nginx + gunicorn or better nginx + uwsgi are better options than apache + mod_python to serve your django app

according to many benchmarks uwsgi seems to provides better performance than gunicorn and if the performance doesn t change significantly you ll be able to focus your investigation on nginx or ec2 configurations

i ve been using uwsgi in production on heroku for over a year and it seems to handle everything a lot better than gunicorn


haskell	agda---------------------------------------------------

comm	grep---------------------------------------------------

jar	war---------------------------------------------------

jsf runnable non-class
resources in war have higher classloading precedence than those in jar so the empty file would be loaded instead

when a jsf resource is found in war instead of jar then those in war will have higher loading precedence over those in jars

resources in war have higher loading precedence than those in jar

5 a war file can be runnable executable though this is more common with jar files

i have the jersey resource classes bundled within a larger war as jar file which is now residing underneath web-inf lib folder on websphere application server

accessing and dynamically reloading non-class resources inside jar war files is way easier

like remove the jar s from your war in case the version of your jar is same or lower than that of jboss s or replace the jar s of jboss and remove that jar s from your war in case the version of your jar is higher than that of jboss s


division	modulo---------------------------------------------------

faster higher machine
multiplication division and modulo have the same precedence and they all have higher precedence than addition and subtraction

edit if you want to be clever about it you can even use loops division and modulo to separate higher numbers into their places values

if however you do need something quicker than division and modulo then bitwise operations come to help

it is true that division and modulo a division operation is slower than addition

for example on most 32 bit systems 64-bit addition is faster than 32-bit division modulo

the bitwise operators are generally faster than modulo and division operators

in those cases the modulo will be negative and the result of integer division will be one more than you want

it appears that you consider modulo to have lower precedence than multiplication and division when in fact it does not

is the same as because division has higher priority than modulo

bit operations are usually faster than division or modulo calculations

since bit wise operations can be done very fast and division operations are relatively slow this type of modulo is much faster than doing a division

division and a table lookup versus a square root on your machine using this modulo might be faster

if so this should work and it should also be a lot quicker than using modulo and division

integer multiplication division and modulo are much slower than integer addition and subtraction

if you compute modulo a power of two using bitwise and is simpler and generally faster than performing division

performing addition on this slightly larger type will pretty much always be faster than doing division or modulo on the type itself

i am a bit suspicious of the performance because modulo tends to use division which is slower than your subtraction operations

the division and modulo should run in shorter and more consistent time than the loop on any machine that has hardware division which many do

a side effect of many division routines is the modulo - so in few cases should division actually be faster than modulo

additionally with the base being a power of 2 the modulo and division operations are much faster than with your base-10 approach

in this particular case you concluded that a bitwise-and operation of c++ language must be implemented by a bitwise-and machine operation while a modulo must somehow involve machine division which is allegedly slower

note parentheses are redundant as division and multiplication have the same priority and modulo has higher precedence over addition

the addition is much cheaper than other operations like modulo and division and array access

taking the remainder of the division by 256 through the modulo effectively extracts the lower byte since the result will be 256 by definition

you can use division and modulo to do it easier

i believe doing this division modulo would be faster but i cannot implement it in linked list


fashion long branch
modulo is a bit weird for floating point - it returns negative for negative so you still have to have a branch and it involves a division which is slower on some machines as in i ve not found a machine where is significantly less expensive than going round a loop with a couple of subtractions two or three times

so in simple terms this should give you a feel for why division and hence modulo is slower computers still have to do long division in the same stepwise fashion tha you did in grade school


number situations bits
implementing multiplication and division might be more costly than you would like but at least addition is easy modulo protecting against over underflow and you claim to not need any operations so even better

modulo gives you a remainder which is why it s better than straight division in situations where you re number of elements can change

programmers like to use this property to speed up programs because it s easy to chop off some number of bits but performing a modulo is much harder it s about as hard as doing a division

then you can process any length number using very few division remainder modulo operations which is important because they are much slower than addition


super	self---------------------------------------------------

parent.foo x useful
i think a.__init__ self x is better then super .__init__ x because it supports multiple inheritance and i didn t find a way to do it with super

normally you can just call parent class methods directly by doing parent.foo self ... but in case of multiple inheritance super is much more useful


printwriter	bufferedwriter---------------------------------------------------

lisp	racket---------------------------------------------------

side common implementations
do racket macros have more advanced functionality than those found in scheme or common lisp

on the side of using macros racket has always been more advanced than other scheme and lisp implementations


wxhaskell	gtk2hs---------------------------------------------------

quicksort	mergesort---------------------------------------------------

complicated solid longer
quicksort is also more complicated than mergesort especially if you want to write a really solid implementation and so if you re aiming for simplicity and maintainability merge sort becomes a promising alternative with very little performance loss

quicksort and mergesort is longer and seems more complicated but it is o n log n


comparisons number efficient
mergesort uses about 30 less comparisons than quicksort

purely in terms of the number of comparisons performed is mergesort always more efficient than quicksort

compared with quicksort mergesort has less number of comparisons but larger number of moving elements

interestingly quicksort performs more comparisons on average than mergesort - 1.44 n lg n expected for quicksort versus n lg n for mergesort


algorithm parallel online
i have been testing the practicality of openmp gnu parallel sort algorithms in the c++ standard library and have found the parallel quicksort algorithm to be significantly slower than the mergesort algorithm

it s not a question of is map reduce better than mergesort or quicksort because map reduce is just a tool for implementing a sorting algorithm like mergesort or quicksort in a parallel way

insertion sort for example has an average time-complexity of o n 2 worse than quicksort or mergesort but as an online algorithm it can efficiently sort a list of values as they are received as user input where most other algorithms can only efficiently operate on a complete list of values


implementation libc function
when comparison function is a callback function like in quicksort libc implementation quicksort is slower than mergesort by 15 on random input and 30 for already sorted array for 64 bit integers

when comparing my quicksort implementation with std sort on my compiler and my implementation of mergesort i noticed an odd pattern on large data sets when operating on 64 bit integers quicksort is consistently faster than mergesort


faster heapsort slower
quicksort and mergesort are faster in terms of sorting and should be always used before a bubble sort

quicksort is approximately 40 faster than mergesort on random data because of fewer data movements

mergesort is slightly slower than quicksort but it does not have quicksort s susceptibility to pathological cases

mergesort - in general mergesort is consistently faster than quicksort however quicksort is done in place and doesn t require allocating memory unlike mergesort

however on smaller int sizes quicksort gets slower and mergesort gets faster

this works just fine but i ve read native javascript sort performing slower than implemented mergesort and quicksort that there are faster options especially if your requirements meet certain conditions

as many people have noted the average case performance for quicksort is faster than mergesort

binary tree sort in particular is likely to be slower than mergesort or quicksort because of the tree-balancing overhead as well as cache access patterns.

from what i ve read i was expecting quicksort to be faster than mergesort but on my code it is not so i assume there must be a problem with my quicksort algorithm

depending on where i look people say quicksort is faster than mergesort due to its locality of reference cache hits etc

quicksort is usually faster than mergesort just because it s easier to code a tight implementation and the operations it does can go faster

typically mergesort is slower than heapsort and quicksort but that s usually under the assumption that comparisons are fast

for 5 000 000 ints still stored in memory quicksort becomes suddenly worse then heapsort and mergesort

worst case for quicksort is actually worse than heapsort and mergesort but quicksort is faster on average

it might be helpful to see why quicksort is usually faster than mergesort since if you understand the reasons you can pretty quickly find some cases where mergesort is a clear winner

quicksort is a partitioning sorting algorithm you might refer to mergesort which also is a partitioning sorting algorithm the biggest difference is probably the speed quicksort is faster even though both of them are o n log n

i ran the two and while the quicksort was faster for smaller data sets 100 elements and i did verify that it works the mergesort became the quicker algorithm fairly quickly

quicksort generally runs faster than mergesort but under some circumstances it can degrade to quadratic running time

although quicksort runs in quadratic time as compared to mergesort which runs in linear-log time quicksort is usually faster in practice

i have read that quicksort is much faster than mergesort in practise and the reason for this is the hidden constant

normally quicksort is faster than mergesort which is faster than heapsort

for the 10 tests on the same list the results should be quite the same at least all showing that quicksort is faster than mergesort or vice vesa

the quicksort algorithm is faster than mergesort which is what sorted will get you when called on a sequence of objects via java.util.arrays.sort

native javascript sort performing slower than implemented mergesort and quicksort

in most cases quicksort will run faster than mergesort even though the worst-case execution time is longer


specific first test
you can also see that for smaller collections quicksort is faster but then mergesort takes the lead but all of this is case specific so take your time to study all 4 algorithms

to be specific the quicksort runs faster than mergesort in the first test case and loses badly in the following 9 tests


better worst complexity
quicksort is not better it is well suited for a different kind of application than mergesort

an interesting answer about this can be found at why is quicksort better than mergesort

for instance quicksort can outperform mergesort although mergesort is provably better than quicksort in the worst case

for example locality of references has influence on cache hits or misses which is the reason why quicksort performs better than mergesort

technically mergesort has a better time-behavior î nlogn worst and average cases than quicksort î n 2 worst case î nlogn average case

quicksort is more sensitive to input sortedness in a positive way than mergesort

furthermore you ll have no clue which size it is above which mergesort will perform better on quicksort s worst case arrays as this depends on implementation issues for example one compiler may compile your code in a way that the delete operation in sort4 is very costly in terms of time and so for most reasonably sized arrays sort3 might turn out to be always faster

quicksort is worse complexity than mergesort in the worst case.

i know mergesort is better since it is stable and doesn t have n 2 as worst case but i required to implement quicksort

given that it is possible to vastly reduce the likelihood of the worst case of quicksort s time complexity via random selection of the pivot for example i think one could argue that mergesort is worse in all but the pathological case of quicksort

mergesort may use more space than quicksort i m not entirely sure and merge may be better for linkedlists

i ve seen plenty of questions asking whether quicksort or mergesort is better and when to use each of them but what i d like to see is some input on when to use them with regard to the size of the data being sorted

1- use a sorting algotithm like mergesort or quicksort has better performance with small inputs


recursive base calls
that way quicksort can reach recursive base case more quicker than mergesort

quicksort consistently has less recursive calls than mergesort


better simpler parallelizing
quicksort is implemented well it is typically 2-3 times faster than mergesort or

i would say that the quicksort is simpler for parallelizing than the mergesort

quicksort usually is better than mergesort for two reasons

why is quicksort better than mergesort

is quicksort always better than mergesort

i ve looked at the question at why is quicksort better than mergesort

scenarios when quicksort is worse than mergesort

quicksort is not better than mergesort

it s because that quicksort is generally faster that people use it instead of mergesort

parallelizing mergesort is simpler than quicksort in-place

previously discussed on so why is quicksort better than mergesort


practice bad world
in practice it ll take longer than quicksort which is why quicksort variants are favored over mergesort in the real world

quicksort has a bad worst case while mergesort is always o n log n guaranteed but typical quicksort implementations are faster than mergesort in practice


rtp	rtcp---------------------------------------------------

ostringstream	std---------------------------------------------------

better typesafe jogojapan
std ostringstream is much better for that kind of thing

but in c++ std ostringstream is better and typesafe as joachim explained in his answer

as jogojapan said using std ostringstream is a better choice


string char word
if word is not a a std string or a char you should use a std ostringstream which handles more types see

all you ve determined is that std string is probably smaller in size than std ostringstream and so it doesn t fill up the stack as quickly


faster downsides idea
however std ostringstream is probably faster for appending if you absolutely have no idea about the size you have to reserve

this was finally slightly faster than std ostringstream but it has few downsides


lxml	elementtree---------------------------------------------------

api speed application
elementtree is included in the standard library but lxml is faster

but in general you will find that lxml is faster more effective and has an api which adheres closely to a python standard the elementtree which comes with the python standard library

lxml is faster than elementtree but i ve never found an application where the speed boost paid for the hassles of distribution


mouseover	mouseenter---------------------------------------------------

method use mouseup
in this case mouseenter mouseleave has better behaviour and prevents bubbling compared to mouseover mouseout

imho mouseenter and mouseleave are much more reliable than mouseover and mouseout which tend to flicker

this may make for various race conditions and may necessitate using events which give you earlier notification than mouseup mousedown mouseenter mouseleave mouseover mouseout

also instead of mouseover and mouseout use the better ones mouseenter and mouseleave or simply the .hover method

also you might want to use mouseenter and mouseleave which are sanitized by jquery and are a little more reliable than mouseover and mouseout

it should also be noted that mouseenter and mouseleave work somewhat differently and usually much better than mouseover and mouseout

because jquery doesn t use mouseover and mouseout it uses mouseenter and mouseleave which are more suited to this scenario

mouseover events can occur multiple times so mouseenter is a better option for this

i have no idea about the classes but i think mouseenter and mouseleave are better alternative for mouseout and mouseover


set	bag---------------------------------------------------

sorting	grouping---------------------------------------------------

faster documents rest
apparently groupby with count and sorting the grouping was noticeably faster with sparksql

so i started thinking that sorting would be faster if i created an index on the column that i plan to always sort on even if the rest of my query is missing where grouping by having etc

the reason being that sorting less elements which the grouping generally produces is going to be faster than sorting all input documents


columns int fields
this way only a single int column needs to be sorted grouping which performs much better than sorting two text columns

instead knowing that we want to grouping by these columns we can make the application code to do so simpler by sorting by these fields


faster operations values
in my experience hashing is always faster than sorting for joining and for grouping

when not sorting before grouping it is much faster but then i get values from random parts of hour

also in some cases sorting and grouping operations are faster when implemented in php rather than in sql


efficient order loop
alter how i am joining the tables together so that the sorting of the results for the grouping by is more efficient and then hopefully remove the tmp table as well

does linq use any sorting or other mechanisms to make a grouping join more efficient so it doesn t have to loop through an entire collection for every unmatched item

first sort the dataframe by time this should be more efficient than sorting each grouping by time

of course ordering could be forced obj.gettype .tostring and using lexical order but since a strict order is not necessary only grouping i was wondering if there s a more efficient way than sorting


symfony	silex---------------------------------------------------

wadl	wsdl---------------------------------------------------

mtu	icmp---------------------------------------------------

ienumerable	iqueryable---------------------------------------------------

better database data
so if you working with only in-memory data collection ienumerable is a good choice but if you want to query data collection which is connected with database iqueryable is a better choice as it reduces network traffic and uses the power of sql language

i have read about ienumerable and iqueryable i have read that iqueryable is better with linq because when you use where clauses it creates the exact query it needs but with ienumerable it retrieves all rows from database and then filters on memory

the ienumerable side of linq which works on in-memory objects that are already in the heap will almost certainly perform better than the iqueryable side which exists to be translated into a native query language like sql


better ilist types
or perhaps ienumerable is better since ienumerable types can be cast to iqueryable to be used with linq

i understand the differences between iqueryable and ienumerable but would an ienumerable object be better for data that allows filtering

generally ienumerable and iqueryable are even better than ilist as they re more generic unless you want to limit this with good reason of course

what i know is using iqueryable is better than ienumerable if another query is going to be performed


database place interaction
i d say iqueryable is more suitable for interaction with a database than ienumerable is

with really basic calls to the database iqueryable is way quicker but when do i need to think about using an ienumerable in its place


generic instances
ienumerable is more generic than iqueryable though all instances of iqueryable implement ienumerable and only defines

ienumerable is more generic than iqueryable though all


entity objects framework
i often use such code with the entity framework and iqueryable to generate smaller sql queries but it works just as well for linq to objects ienumerable

entity framework s iqueryable implementation is more picky about creating new objects in objects than regular linq to objects ienumerable


antialiasing	transparent---------------------------------------------------

explode	implode---------------------------------------------------

space better string
if and only if you are using a string for the split string which is not ever going to show up inside the middle of the other strings space may or may not be the case for this then i agree with the others that implode and explode are much simpler

any better way than to explode and implode the string


strcpy	strdup---------------------------------------------------

identical faster cleaner
because of the above replace strdup with strlen malloc memcpy memcpy is slightly faster than strcpy

additionally if you have strdup then it is much more convenient than strlen + malloc + strcpy with identical result including the same obligation to free the allocated storage when you no longer need it

or indeed if your system has strdup or you re willing to write an implementation then strdup is much cleaner than malloc + strcpy


distance	polygons---------------------------------------------------

minimum magnitude maximum
does the polygons encompass the circle this is that special case where the distance from all of the sides of the polygons would be greater than the circle s radius but the circle and polygons still obviously intersect

if the magnitude of the distance between the center of the circle and the center of the polygons is less than the radius of the circle the polygons intersects

if that distance is less than the radius of the circle then you know that the polygons intersects the circle

calculate the actual minimum distance and continue through the sorted list until the maximum distance between the polygons is greater than the minimum distance found so far


data st_distance function
to answer your original question as to how to generate the smaller polygons you can find the centroid of each polygons and offset each vertex by a percentage of the distance to that centroid point of the polygons to get the smaller polygons

notes the width of the polygons cannot be fixed as you realize because at articulation points the distance will be larger

root punto is a valid geojson point i checked it with the st_isvalid function and also if i use the function st_distance checking if the distance between the point and the polygons is greater than zero the data retrieved is correct but i don t know if this approach is correct


keystore	jks---------------------------------------------------

carrierwave	paperclip---------------------------------------------------

onchange	onblur---------------------------------------------------

focusout blur everyone
also i am not sure why everyone is suggesting onblur isn t onchange is better for validation purpose

onchange is a better choice than onblur or focusout because blur and focusout also fire when the contents of the text field hasn t changed


addition	multiplication---------------------------------------------------

several instruction programers
it used to be that multiplication was slower than addition and programers used several tricks to avoid multiplication but with haswell it seems that it s the other way around

it is well-known that the processor instruction for multiplication takes several times more time than addition division is even worse upd which is not true any more see below


precedence higher subtraction
the precedence relationship is the same multiplication is higher then addition

for example multiplication is of higher precedence than addition so 2 + 3 x 4 is equivalent to 2 + 3 x 4 not 2 + 3 x 4

multiplication division and modulo have the same precedence and they all have higher precedence than addition and subtraction

it might seem unintuitive but it has a lower precedence than multiplication addition and modulo operations

which doesn t do what you want because multiplication has higher precedence than addition

in arithmetic books and computer software and more-expensive calculators this means 12+ 34 56 not 12+34 56 because multiplication has higher precedence than addition

for example since multiplication has a higher precedence than addition is read as not

but that s not the case here since division and multiplication have higher precedence than addition and there are no parentheses involved

and has higher precedence than or just like multiplication has higher precedence than addition

this is valid under normal arithmetic operator precedence rules because multiplication has higher precedence than addition +

and has higher precedence than or so the brackets are optional - in the same way as multiplication has higher precedence than addition so

clearly ruby considers the multiplication operator to be of a higher precedence than the addition + operator

multiplication has a higher precedence than addition so it is evaluated first

of course multiplication has higher precedence binds more tightly than addition

for example 1 + 2 3 is treated as 1 + 2 3 whereas 1 2 + 3 is treated as 1 2 + 3 since multiplication has a higher precedence than addition

mathematics clearly defines the order of operations as giving multiplication higher precedence than addition

that s because the multiplication oprator has higher precedence than addition

in technical terms the x multiplication operator has higher precedence than the + addition operator

but both addition and multiplication have higher precedence than bitwise or so why no warning on the int b expression

the multiplication has higher precedence and therefore binds more tightly than addition

for example in the expression 1 + 5 3 the answer is 16 and not 18 because the multiplication operator has a higher precedence than the addition + operator

for example 1 + 2 3 is treated as 1 + 2 3 whereas 1 2 + 3 is treated as 1 2 + 3 since multiplication has a higher precedence than addition +

this is similar to operator precedence in mathematics where for example multiplication has a higher priority than addition

associativity and precedence specify that the last two statements must be performed in that order since multiplication has higher precedence than addition

usually multiplication has a higher precedence than addition but the grammar you have posted has the reverse that might be part of your problem

since multiplication has a higher precedence than addition the same convention is used

of course it is 10 because the addition operator has a lower precedence than the multiplication operator and so 4 + 3 2 always means 4 + 3 2

why with this grammar multiplication have higher precedence than addition

you probably already remember that multiplication is higher precedence than addition

multiplication has a higher operator precedence than addition so it s done before the two additions when calculating the value for a

multiplication has higher precedence than addition subtraction

the and operator has higher precedence than or just like multiplication has higher precedence than addition

then the multiplication happens before the addition because multiplication is higher precedence

multiplication and division have higher priority than addition and subtraction

to start with i need multiplication and division to take higher precedence than addition and subtraction

note that the type cast has a higher precedence than multiplication which is in turn higher than addition 3 vs

for instance in arithmetic multiplication has higher precedence than addition

finally we all know that multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction so we can remove the extraneous parentheses so this turns into

trig functions should have precedence lower than multiplication and higher than addition

an expression like binds as not because of associativity but because 2 multiplication has higher precedence that + 2 addition

just like it would be possible to come up with arithmetic expressions that could be written with less parentheses if addition had a higher precedence than multiplication

either way your example with the numeric expression would multiplying by 3 first because multiplication has higher precedence than addition or subtraction

this line works because of operator precedence multiplication has a higher precedence than addition + so it will be done first

multiplication and division have a higher precedence than addition and subtraction

because multiplication has a higher precedence than addition

and the value of this expression evaluated according to the precedence rules is 62 because multiplication has higher precedence than addition

note parentheses are redundant as division and multiplication have the same priority and modulo has higher precedence over addition

isinstance g str and g.lower or g multiplication is of higher precedence than addition

it s because multiplication has higher precedence than addition

division multiplication has higher precedence than addition subtraction and parentheses is required to do addition subtraction before multiplication division

for example if you had a class in which it would make sense to do addition before multiplication how could you make the addition operator have higher precedence than the multiplication one

you expression is then 7 + 5 7 + 5 which is 7 + 35 + 5 as multiplication has a higher precedence than addition

the only way it would be broken up differently would be if addition had a higher precedence than subtraction like multiplication does

multiplication and division are higher precedence than addition so they get done first - before the implicit conversion to string for concatenation

well we know it is the first one because of precedence - the binary multiplication operator has higher precedence than the binary + addition operator and is resolved first

this is happening because the concatenation operator has a higher precedence than the addition or subtraction operators but multiplication and division have a higher precedence then concatenation

division and multiplication have higher precedence than addition so what this is actually doing is

just because multiplication has a higher precedence than addition doesn t mean we need to perform all multiplication in the expression before doing any addition

so in your case an expression like 3+2 5 would yield 25 instead of 13 because addition is of higher precedence than multiplication


simple efficient overhead
as multiplication of ints has more overhead than simple addition

in addition to the other answers usually simple multiplication is way more efficient than using pow


execution types integer
so ideally i want to have approximate relative times of elementary operations execution like multiplication typically takes 5 times more time than addition exponent is about 100 multiplication

each execution of the inner loop body takes constant bounded time assuming we re dealing with fixed-width integer types otherwise it would depend on the multiplication algorithm used and addition but that s hard to implement in a way that multiplication is faster so the execution of the body of the outer loop is o d î d even where


results binary-bitwise expressions
direction of evaluation does not affect the results of expressions that include more than one multiplication addition + or binary-bitwise | operator at the same level

the direction of evaluation does not affect the results of expressions that include more than one multiplication addition + or binary-bitwise | operator at the same level.


math strong performance
the reason for this is that and is strong than or it s like in math where multiplication is stronger than addition 3 5+3 15+3 18

note that this algorithm avoids any math more complicated than addition and multiplication so will likely have much better performance than something that requires trig functions


faster slower speed
instead of computing the slower it instead computed x + x because addition is faster than multiplication

even if addition is faster than multiplication i think that you will lose more because of the branching

addition should be faster as multiplication

multiplication is nearly always a lot slower than addition

the same speed as addition though still faster than multiplication

i would also be moderately surprised if the multiplication actually was faster than the addition

also addition is faster than multiplication and multiplication is faster than division

because addition is faster than multiplication and can be faster than shift

yes pow is slower than multiplication multiplication is slower than addition

at the time this was faster because addition was a lot faster than multiplication but that s no longer the case

but in many cases addition is faster than multiplication

on simple low-cost processors typically bitwise operations are substantially faster than division several times faster than multiplication and sometimes significantly faster than addition

if multiplication is slower than addition instead of doing

an addition is faster than a division and a multiplication

multiplication is generally slower than addition


expensive
but i guess multiplication is more computationally expensive than addition

also remember multiplication is much more expensive than addition


opcache	apc---------------------------------------------------

exponent	modulo---------------------------------------------------

exponentiation large raw
1024 bit private exponent large number lower than the modulo

note that the private exponent is limited to value of the modulo but may sometimes be up to a few bytes smaller than the modulo

in rsa signing a message m means exponentiation with the private exponent d the result r is the smallest integer 0 and smaller than the modulo n so that

the private exponent is always smaller than the modulo so you should be able to encrypt it using the raw rsa operation if you make sure to remove the prepended zero


risk longer rsa
so no choice of the public exponent for this modulo is better than 19 using the public exponent to decrypt will work for at least half of the messages when eâ² 9 16 and in many cases for almost all the messages when eâ² 1 16

when i generate rsa key pairs by openssl it seems like private key private exponent is always less than public key modulo

the rsa private exponent may actually be shorter than the modulo

edit as gregs points out in the comments you cannot be sure that the private exponent of the key you want to encrypt is smaller than the modulo of the key you want to use to encrypt with

i must also add that designing the rsa key so that the private exponent is substantially shorter than the modulo to speed up operations is a security risk if the exponent is smaller than 29 of the modulo length then the key can be cracked

the private exponent must not be longer than the modulo


trac	bugzilla---------------------------------------------------

r-tree	quadtree---------------------------------------------------

neighbours window nearest
r-tree are substantially faster than quadtree for window queries like inside contains covers etc

quadtree indexes are created faster than r-tree

r-tree are much faster than quadtree for nearest neighbours queries


fast easier faster
maybe a r-tree or a quadtree can be faster

quadtree are easier to implement r-tree can be twice as fast than quadtree


textarea	textbox---------------------------------------------------

allocator	stl---------------------------------------------------

hide	fadeout---------------------------------------------------

thin	webrick---------------------------------------------------

better performance slower
in production it is much better to use a more sophisticated server like phusion passenger or unicorn since they have better performance than thin mongrel or webrick

from my experience webrick is slower than mongrel is slower than thin


webclient	webrequest---------------------------------------------------

simpler easier
webclient is sometimes easier to use than webrequest

a webclient is much easier than a webrequest

webclient is simpler to use than webrequest


capitalize	uppercase---------------------------------------------------

height	border-box---------------------------------------------------

header_wrapper overflow better
in the above code #header seems to overflow out of #header_wrapper because of and which adds up to more than the height of #header_wrapper and even though box-sizing border-box has been applied its still overflowing

adjust the padding and use box-sizing border-box to have better control of the height


domxpath	domdocument---------------------------------------------------

lxml	celementtree---------------------------------------------------

certain world elementtree
while celementtree is fast the world standard lxml library which also implements the elementtree is faster still

the lxml library is proven much faster for parsing and un-parsing xml but celementtree is much faster for certain kinds of manipulation


inherited	properties---------------------------------------------------

flexibility instances memory
if you need a globally accessible variable or properties that s more suited to a base class that your classes inherited from

but using the prototype instances can inherited properties which means less memory and you gain a lot of flexibility

this allows me to keep all of my models from having to inherited from a base class that has a messages properties and gives me more flexibility


higher precedence form
if a browser s stylesheet does define a style for all types of element and this style has a higher precendence than inherited then inherited properties values should never be observed

in essence an object inherited all properties of its prototype but an object s own properties has higher precedence than those of its prototype

i don t see any form properties in the code you posted so either the posted code has been modified or the properties is higher in the inherited tree simpleformcontroller


methods dedicated clear
using dedicated methods for getting and setting properties is also more clear in inherited

inherited can be more about invoking properties and methods in an execution context similar to how we use .call or .apply and doesn t need to beget a massive codebase full of modules extending other modules only to end up treating them like completely isolated and individual objects anyway


better method related
less is a css extension that enables reuse and encapsulation of values color values for instance improves inherited allows a better nesting of related properties and operations also

potentially you are trying to model something in inherited that is better suited for composition or your base class should be taking in an object instead of individual related properties if the properties aren t related then perhaps your base class is doing too much single responsibility principle

you cannot do that on that way but you can access a properties s setter method from a derived class so you can use inherited for the purpose

since the paddle object has properties that are shared by both player and enemy composition is a better choice than inherited

the textfield abstract class which singlelinetextfield inherited from defines a tostring method but also value and values properties which are much better suited to what you re trying to do

multiple inherited makes it easier to compose classes from small mixin base classes that implement functionality and have properties to remember state


boost	stl---------------------------------------------------

libraries richer containers
boost libraries are generally less mature and less standard than stl

as for not reinventing the wheel like many have said already make sure to first explore the possibilities in the standard template library stl which is much richer than you might think and then look at boost www.boost.org which has libraries for a lot of diverse purposes and they are extremely high quality and some are just works of art like spirit proto lambda and mpl

qset and other qt containers are less versatile than stl or boost containers


learning solutions huge
once you re past the basics with c++ learning how to use parts of stl and then how it works will be better than tackling boost

.net library support is way better and cleaner than stl mfc and boost

i am developing this using c++ so solutions using stl or boost would be even better

c++ s stl is getting better and better yet it s not nearly as huge as boost and is not intended to

maybe this would have all been better with boost but i m still learning stl and didn t go that way

i ve used both for the same project boost is better integrated with the stl and especially c++ exceptions


fseek	fread---------------------------------------------------

percentile	max---------------------------------------------------

tinyint	boolean---------------------------------------------------

nunit	mstest---------------------------------------------------

slower faster
nunit is faster as compared to mstest

from my experience mstest is much slower than nunit


features bunch manpower
nunit is more widespread mbunit has the most features but mstest has more manpower behind it

mstest is missing a bunch of features that nunit has and nunit has been around longer is more mature


better support example
although several ci tools such as teamcity have better support for nunit probably would change as mstest becomes more popular

he concludes that nunit wins for unit testing but mstest has much better abilities for integration based testing and team testing with team system

example with nunit i have better experiences with nunit than with mstest

various people told me to go with nunit since it s better than mstest apparently i have no idea and it also has very good support in resharper which i m using

nunit has better support for parameterized tests than mstest


faster speeds instrumentation
nonetheless i tried to compare the sum of all test speeds and in some cases nunit is faster and in other cases mstest is faster

thus i suspect when people say that nunit is much faster than mstest it is because of the loading and updating delays but the actual test execution time appears to be very similar

the best testdriven.net disables all instrumentation that mstest does so it makes mstest blazing fast - much faster than nunit for example


frameworks difficult environment
unit-testing frameworks like mstest and nunit provide little more than the environment in which to run a suite of programmatic tests

i ve read time and time again that tdd test first is more difficult with mstest than it is with other testing frameworks such as nunit mbunit etc.


strcpy	strncpy---------------------------------------------------

null nonsense intuitive
it is in fact considered to be much more dangerous than strcpy since the null termination mechanism of strncpy is not intuitive and therefore often misunderstood

it was never intended to be some safe version of strcpy - that s complete nonsense since strncpy is far more unsafe because of the null termination issue


safer better string
strcpy is notoriously unsafe as are it s cousins strcpy_s and strncpy although they are mildly safer than strcpy

using strncpy instead of strcpy is normally safer but here you alloc eachtime the right amount of memory needed to store inpoint into mpoint so i cant see what s the point

strcpy could be better replaced by strncpy which does some bound checking

i was exploring around with c regarding strncpy since most people says that it is safer than strcpy additional parameter length to avoid buffer overflows

i.e strncpy is actually better than the simpler strcpy if you are willing to improve the code

myth 3 strncpy is a safer version of strcpy

using strncpy 3 is better than strcpy 3 but things like strlcpy 3 are better still

strncpy is safer than strcpy

in general strncpy is a safer alternative to strcpy

of course you might still ask whether to use strncpy or strcpy in implementing that abstraction strncpy is safer there provided you fully grok what it does

replaced strcpy with strncpy which is much safer apparently and that removed the segmentation fault

for comparison of strcpy and strncpy which is the safer alternative see their manual page

strncpy is not safer than strcpy it just trades one type of bugs with another

you should use strcpy or strncpy safer than strcpy to copy the string stored in the array between arrays

to copy a string in c use carefully strcpy 3 often strncpy is better

switch from using strcpy to strncpy or strncat which i think is better than strncpy

strncpy is not safer method to use as strcpy

concerning the problem your printpiglatin could use the existing function strcpy or better strncpy which is safer in regards to buffer overflows


faster memcpy slower
also you will find that using strcpy strncpy is much faster than a simple loop to copy each char

memcpy is rarely slower than strcpy or strncpy and often significantly faster

memcpy can be faster than strcpy and strncpy because it does not have to compare each copied byte with 0 and because it already knows the length of the copied object


subtract	add---------------------------------------------------

precedence higher example
to make the value gotten from the above steps to a hexadecimal digit in character form then for values lower than 10 add 0 if you re on a computer with with ascii encoding and for values at 10 or higher then subtract ten and add a

multiplying and divide have higher precedence than add and subtract

this garentees that while a can be issued to the pipeline every cycle it will have a higher latency than an add subtract circuit

to give multiplying and divide higher precedence than add and subtract you can do something like this example adapted from john levine lex yacc 2 e 1992


greater value larger
if there is more than that subtract 250 + 180 and add 6 h to the time needed

quick idea - go through the roman number from right to left if value of more to the left is smaller than then subtract it from the result if larger then add it

while the number is greater than stacksize add a stacksize to the stack and subtract that from the number

then while the temp value is greater than 99 subtract 100 from it and add 1 to the counter

if it is much larger or smaller than 1 add subtract a constant from both log_a and log_b

i need some help though i need each number in that list to be subtract from 27 then if the result is less than 33 add 94 then print the numbers as they were just with that sum completed how do i do this

if you continue to use your method of performing this task then you need to manually check if the addition of the two lower order decimal digits has caused a carry by checking if the result of the addition is greater than 10 and if it is subtract 10 from the number and then add 1 to the higher order digit calculation

just take the difference and if it s negative add 2pi and then if it s greater than 2pi subtract 2pi

provided a string i want to convert the chars from the string to an int add a value from another method getkey to this number and if the result is greater than 26 subtract 26

one simple approach is that if the sprite is headed away from the center line the value you add subtract is larger than if the sprite is heading back towards the center line

look at it this way based on your logic while x is greater than 100 add 5 while it s greater than 500 subtract 5 .

of the original length until this add subtract value is less than 1

then while the temp value is greater than 9 subtract 10 from it and add 1 to the counter

but my guess would be that in this particular chunk of code multiplying divide and modulo all take roughly the same amount of time and that time is greater than add or subtract


slower faster sequence
shift and add subtract sequence was slower than the lea method above

in other words hardly anything slower than multiplying add subtract but not enough to really worry about

since addition can be faster then subtraction we add the offset instead of subtract it from 31

as you can see just doing the multiplication is many many times slower than add or subtract


remainder oodles
division is much harder to calculate with subtractions can t go too far find remainder - if a float then calculate fraction from remainder which in itself is oodles of add multiplying and subtract

if the remainder is less than 3 subtract the remainder else add 5 - remainder


uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller---------------------------------------------------

rotations settoolbaritems class
the uinavigationcontroller class seems to handle better rotations than uiviewcontroller

or there should also be a method settoolbaritems animated on the uiviewcontroller not the uinavigationcontroller which is perhaps better


cos	sqrt---------------------------------------------------

faster cheaper function
the jni sincos is better than computing sin and cos but the sqrt approach is still faster

if i want to calculate a sin and a cos is it cheaper to calculate a sin and a cos or calculate a sin then a sqrt 1-sin 2 to get the cos

an two for a function like sqrt i could probably write my own constexpr but something like sin or cos would be trickier so is there away around it


mantis	bugzilla---------------------------------------------------

bluetooth	usb---------------------------------------------------

megabytes smooth connectivity
wifi and bluetooth aren t fast enough for a smooth framerate but the data transfer speed across the usb connector is more than enough up to 480 megabytes second

on the other hand a usb connection is far more reliable better supported and of course has the inherent advantage of speed and since it is well supported does not suffer from all the pitfalls bluetooth connectivity does


floating-point	fixed-point---------------------------------------------------

arithmetic faster precision
if you need more than integer accuracy but want to avoid floating-point consider using fixed-point arithmetic instead

it s not necessarily true that the matlab fixed-point arithmetic provides less precision it can be used to provide more precision than ieee floating-point types

but another added benefit of this approach is that it could make your program run faster since fixed-point integer arithmetic is much faster than floating-point arithmetic


exponents addition overflow
addition happens to be exact in fixed-point as long as it does not overflow but fixed-point multiplication is no more exact than floating-point multiplication

fixed-point can be much more exact than floating-point as long as the number s exponents remain in range


bash	zsh---------------------------------------------------

compctl builtin implementation
update turns out that zsh implementation based on builtin compctl is much simpler than the bash implementation based on builtin complete

if using a decently recent version of bash or zsh it s much simpler


superclass	subclassing---------------------------------------------------

specialized interface user
i believe this solution is superior in general to the forward declaration because you re eliminating some tight coupling between your superclass and your subclassing and making a more generic interface besides

generally subclassing have more specialized purposes than their superclass as a result

if you are going for an inherited approach you should keep in mind that subclassing should be more specialized than their respective superclass

superclass creates an user interface while subclassing should create a more specialized version


specific general arguments
i then break down that superclass into subclassing that are more specific to the objects they represent

when your instructor was talking about methods being overwritten i suspect they actually said overridden - where a subclassing can provide a more specific implementation of a method than a superclass or indeed may provide one where the superclass only has the abstract method declaration

it looked weired to me that you are trying to return a subclassing s instance from a superclass s method since superclass usually means a more general concept

superclass defines more general features of the objects of its subclassing

here having a superclass makes more sense or at least having a realnumber subclassing of number

with explicit superclass calling your subclassing can accept more or fewer arguments than its superclass and can decide itself what to pass when calling the superclass

if the subclassing is more specific then it might fill in all by 2 of the arguments to its superclass __init__ method

i know you can add values attributes behaviour that aren t in a superclass to a subclassing to make it more task specific

subclassing must allow more than the superclass not less and going from an argument being optional to not optional is allowing less

if you subclassing has less arguments than a superclass and you could make them optional in the superclass just add placeholders in the subclassing

however you can t use a superclass value where a subclassing is expected because the subclassing is more specific

however they are not the same because the subclassing has more specific functions and data members that accomplish a more specific task that the superclass

so what this says is that provided your subclassing doesn t have any more values than the superclass used to determine ordering implementing is reasonable

whether one method s declared arguments are more specific than another subclassing are more specific than their superclass

the other way round returning a subclassing that is a more specific class does not break the contract because the subclassing has at least the same functionality as the superclass

technically the subclassing tend to be more specific and the superclass are more generalized

i noticed that often times i do not clearly know whether a superclass of a number of subclassing should be more general or more restricted regarding the attributes

the general problem is that the subclassing is more specific than the superclass


methods method object
if we are creating an object of a subclassing and invoking the method of superclass and if subclassing extends more than one class which superclass method should be called

so i inspected the compiled firebasemessagingservice which was the subclassing of com.google.firebase.iid.zzb and had zzae intent method as private but its subclassing firebasemessagingservice had protected access i know that subclassing cannot have weaker reference than its superclass so i guess there is something wrong with firebasemessagingservice library

many of the libgdx and android classes are designed this way they implement a bit of functionality but expect subclassing to implement more and the subclassing is expected to invoke the superclass method

shouldn t a subclassing interfaced be able to take in more than the superclass interfacec and use the same method

i always think of it as b having more stuff in it then a subclassing often have more methods than superclass hence b gets the wide end of the arrow and a gets the pointy end

imagine your superclass has an object member but in your subclassing this is now more defined to be an integer

creating a subclassing should mean more than just a convenient way to call superclass methods

these relations naturally arise when you impose restrictions on what you can handle--then if a subclassing means that the method can handle less acts as a superclass of since can handle everything that the subclassing can handle and more

you can override a method in a subclassing to add more functionality to what the superclass has

you can t cast a superclass in a subclassing because the subclassing may have a bigger interface than the superclass means the subclassing can have functions like getunixtimestamp that the superclass doesn t have

if you cast the subclassing to the superclass then the public methods on the subclassing are no longer visible

however if the subclassing returns a narrower subtype of the superclass method return this is called a covariant return type and is allowed in java since jdk 1.5

this gives you more flexibility than subclassing because with subclassing you are automatically inheriting all the methods in the superclass which is far more restricting than simply using some of the methods of another class

2 since superclass is smaller than subclassing one should use memory object carefully

first of all wouldn t that relate to it returning an object that is a superclass which contains less data than requested because a superclass is not a subclassing but a subclassing is a superclass

in general instances of subclassing may be larger than those of their superclass so you should not expect the subclassing to fit into your vector s slot

a subclassing is more flexible and is treated as an entire object which responds to all superclass methods plus it s own

in this case superclass is bigger than subclassing that s why the second statement is correct

in other words if a subclassing is more accessible than its superclass then the access modifier of the superclass loses effect

you cannot have a subclassing with less methods than a superclass

if new member fields are declared in the subclassing then yes a subclassing presumably uses more memory since it has all the fields declared in the superclass plus all the fields declared in the subclassing

the subclassing overridden method cannot have weaker access than superclass method

similarly as the subclassing gains more methods it inherited the list of superclass in the order in which they were named that precede it

on the other side when hiding a static method the static method from subclassing that hides the static method from superclass can allow more but not less access than the hidden method

furthermore since at least in java you can only have the access modifier for an overwritten method to allow more but not less access than the superclass method you are still gonna drag either protected member variables or protected getter and setter all the way up in your subclassing

on the contrary since a subclassing inherited all public methods of its superclass the subclassing are definitely bigger


complex implementation worst
as you mentioned if superclass implementation changes then subclassing can break or more worst - will do unintended things silently

for my understanding the superclass is always smaller less complex then the subclassing

subclassing which implement more complex state should call the superclass s implementation and apply their state to the result if this basic state is to be saved


better variables structure
i have a class structure in java where one class extends another and the subclassing can have more variables than the superclass does

however i don t want to reproduce these classes in every sub-project without a good reason and i can t see how subclassing would make anything better the superclass would still be against the 2.3.3 version of

because if you think about it semantically a subclassing is not a member of the superclass parent child words is misleading in this case superclass and subclassing are better

base class or superclass vs subclassing are better terms imo

if i have a bunch of fields in a parent class that all need to be inherited by subclassing is it better to have the subclassing nested in the superclass make the fields protected rather than private or use protected accessor

most likely it ll still be tightly linked with implementations generally a bad thing or if not bad it s not especially good but i think a structure like this is better than a superclass figuring out what all of its subclassing are

secondly if you want the superclass variables to be accessible by your subclassing it s better to use protected than public

better than modifying superclass output would be to modify the superclass so that the subclassing can provide the appropriate shape name


specific type abstract-class
for example you want to use abstract-class in such a case that each of the subclassing is a more specific type of its abstract superclass fruit apple orange banana grape strawberries etc. and you want to use non-abstract superclass in a relationship such as dad and son

if i have a class hierarchy in which subclassing require use of more specific types than those specified in the superclass ivars is it better to declare the superclass ivar as id or to type it and then cast where necessary in the subclassing


restrictive func original
even in your original post the subclassing is actually more restrictive than the superclass so doing something like

this issue would make sense if it wasn t a constructor as if it were a regular func you could potentially pass in a type that is expected in the superclass but that has been overridden in the subclassing to be more restrictive


pyquery	beautifulsoup---------------------------------------------------

processing results lxml
pyquery is based on lxml so it s also much faster than beautifulsoup

also pyquery is significantly faster than beautifulsoup in many cases for processing results


ceil	floor---------------------------------------------------

works b possible
the floor times the ceil are greater than the floor xy...that s very much possible

works because ceil a b is always one greater than floor a b except when a b is a whole number


std direction element
on the other hand if what you want to do is not rounding but elimination of fractions into one direction then you have std ceil that goes always higher and std floor that always goes lower

so floor idx is the lower element and ceil idx is the higher

now if floor is higher than 0 or ceil is lower than 0 on any axis it means that there just as many tiles outside of the camera scoop


puma	unicorn---------------------------------------------------

udp	rtp---------------------------------------------------

servers performance rtsp
in terms of performance rtp udp streaming is far better but there is no guarantee that it will get transported through the internet via routers nat boxes proxies etc

http streaming servers will in most cases use tcp as their network transport rtsp servers usually offer rtp over udp which is more suited to multimedia streaming where some errors packet loss can be tolerated with the benefit of lower latency and less network overheads


jax-ws	jax-rs---------------------------------------------------

atof	strtod---------------------------------------------------

position job starynkevitch
you can actually switch to strtod always a much better idea than atof and ask it to give you the character position that caused it to stop parsing

edit basile starynkevitch mentions that strtod is better than atof for this job as it gives the ending character


wxpython	pyqt---------------------------------------------------

looks standard appeal
wxpython is probably easier than pyqt or tkinter i don t want to start a framework war

at least they are much easier to intall even pyqt is hard to code for me and wxpython is less attractive when it comes to looks

now all that said...you might get more visual appeal with pygtk pyqt or wxpython though tkinter coming standard is a nice feature


cstdio	iostream---------------------------------------------------

ones extensibility tool
slower than the cstdio ones and extensibility iostream allows

iostream is said to be slower than cstdio but i suggest you use a profiling tool here to find the best set of options here


daemons	launchd---------------------------------------------------

srp	principles---------------------------------------------------

concept useful info
i think the single responsibility principles srp is much more useful in practice -- as long as a class only does one thing it is okay to modify it if the requirements for that one thing change

if you re interested look up some info on srp single responsibility principles to get more info on this concept


joptionpane	jdialog---------------------------------------------------

svg	vml---------------------------------------------------

scrollable	panels---------------------------------------------------

form smaller autoscroll
i have a scrollable panels that shows content larger than the screen

the panels itself is larger than the form and is scrollable autoscroll true

i am trying to create a jpanel that is resizable scrollable and contains x smaller inner panels


textmate	sublimetext---------------------------------------------------

vbo	normals---------------------------------------------------

hive	hdfs---------------------------------------------------

ant	maven---------------------------------------------------

better solution dependencies
however some things ant handles better than maven and if there s not a maven plugin for it it may be difficult to handle in maven

this question is similar in nature to whether ant is better than maven or c# better than java

and it turns out maven really does a better job of managing dependencies for ant build.xml files than does ivy

i find the simple solution ant calls maven more obvious

i read a lot about gradle and it seems to be a better solution than maven or ant

if you need to run all 3 in 1 click then you are better off with maven ant or something similar that has a good integration with eclipse

while you could use -cp to javac to add the required dependencies to this compilation you d be far better served by learning ant or maven

i think updating dependencies with maven is pretty easier than dealing with ant but of course you could select the other way if you feel more conifrtable

i think that inventing something better than both ant and maven wouldn t be that difficult but that tool doesn t seem to exist yet

maven is better for managing dependencies but ant is ok with them too if you use ant+ivy and build artefacts

maven is a better alternative as build system compared to ant

i know that ant would be better for this but i m using maven in my project

trust me i did this before for another job where the system architect decided that maven was better than ant and all of our projects must be converted from ant to maven

while you can munge together a solution with ant maven is a better solution for managing dependencies than ant

maven definitely has better integration with flex than ant

ant and maven may be better suited to java than make or as hank gay points out they may not

you can do things easily in ant that are harder to do in maven

i also find ant with ivy to be better documented than maven although that s not too difficult

while i personally think maven is a better tool than ant in the long run our experience will make maven3 a better tool than maven2

if you want to stick to lower level basic file operations ant is better bet than maven

the sensible thing is to use ant or maven maven is easier better in most cases

note that for more complex builds a java build solution like ant or maven is probably more effective

maven is definitely better than ant and well used for big projects


simpler projects different
ant is simpler and older and the default just called a java project maven is newer more powerful and flexible

if you are looking for a more flexible build than ant or maven but at the same time utilize maven or ivy repositories you should consider gradle

also maven projects come with a different directory structure and seems to be doing much more than what ant does in the spring source tutorial

so i suggest you build a p2 repository can be done in ant but seems simpler in maven tycho and split the projects to several repositories


number useful interesting
a hood technique is to tag milestone releases of your projects giving then a version number and then manage dependencies with maven or a similar tool a bit more sophisticated than ant

having said all of that i do think that maven is a very interesting and useful system i m not calling it a tool like ant is maven is broader than that for software development configuration and build management

ant is older and while it is still used in a number of projects it is rapidly losing ground to maven


script shell class
1 - why ant script generates more .class files than maven

maven can t be compared with ant as in maven vs ant maven is more than a build script than ant is

the second build can run a shell script or ant instead of maven allowing you easier control of your remote server


tasks plugin antrun
if the ant tasks are doing more complicated things which cannot be achieved by maven then you could still look at using the maven antrun plugin

in jacoco 0.7.9 there are jacoco ant tasks and in 0.8.0 there will be jacoco command line interface - both provide more freedom than jacoco maven plugin in specification of what should be included into report in particular can be used for arbitrary third-party jar files


support core mature
first of all ant is older than maven and therefore does not include core support for dependency management

does this make ant more complex than maven

gradle support is much newer and somewhat less mature than ant or maven but it works

i know maven is more powerful than ant


gradle notation rest
alternate build tools ant lots of configuration gradle conventions again less verbose than maven

if they are going to use any non-maven way to retrieve them ui rest scripts ant gradle then you can go with any path and name you like and you ll get full support from artifactory uploading searching etc. with nexus which is much more maven-centric you ll better stick to maven notation


tool future maturity
since ant is more of a scripting tool and doesn t impose structure or lifecycle like maven and gradle you simply manually invoke ant when you want to use it

first maven is a much younger tool than ant or make so you have to expect that its going to take time to get to the maturity level of those applications

while i won t start a war of ant vs maven maven is much more than just a build tool and that may help you in future


jar internal earlier
can maven examine and resolve internal dependencies of non-mavenized jar library defined earlier by ant

the size of maven jar is bigger then ant jar i don t know why help me please


powerful respects excels
but as i checked-out some example apps from spring source repo and it seems that maven is more preferred and powerful than ant

ant is much more powerful than maven in many respects but maven excels in dependency management and ease of deployment


easier gradle tool
i agree with previous answers but i would also recommend to use proper java build tool - like ant perceived easier to use but not necessary or maven perceived more difficult to use but really worth learning

it s a lot easier than ant fully compatible with eclipse use maven eclipse eclipse to create eclipse projects and easy to configure

in the longer term you should really be looking at a build tool such as maven or ant they are much more flexible and they are less dependent on eclipse so changes in your project configuration in eclipse won t affect the final build so much

you get the same mechanism for other dependency managers like ivy oy gradle maven ivy ant gradle are more than just dependency managers but it s not the point here

also forgot to mention junit testing framework and a great eclipse plugin eclemma for code coverage much better than cobertura ecobertura and easier to use and of course you can try maven as the other post mentionned or try ant as build tool

the use of jenkins should be to configure your ci process pipeline where as for builds you should be using a tool like maven ant there are any more which most of these tools are pretty easy to configure

you can take a look on gradle which for me could provide more freedom than maven but is easier to use than ant

ant pre-dates more modern tools like maven and gradle that have this feature baked in


scripts junit meta-program
maven is more of a meta-program that can use ant scripts and run your junit tests

i feel like using scripts ant maven is more natural for this task whereas java needs to work hard to read all the files folders to heap and write them to another folder


multiplying	multiplication---------------------------------------------------

possibility values great
math.random returns double values between 0.0 and 1.0 so even when you are multiplying it with kids.size if size is 1000 there is a great possibility that the multiplication result is still less than 1 and so converting to int would return 0

another possibility would be to multiplying the values and check if the result is equal to 0 but this approach is probably a lot slower since multiplication takes usually more processor cycles than comparing values and or ing them


divide numbers zeros
multiplication is the easier of the tasks just remember to multiplying each block of one number with the other and carry the zeros

multiplication is slightly harder just multiplying two scaled numbers and then divide by your scale factor

perhaps it s also relevant that the first three lines of the posted code multiplying matrix elements repeatedly since repeated multiplication can generate numbers less than 1 as well

so the bottom line is after every divide do the multiplying the 5 with 5 and if the result of multiplication is less than the equals to n then divide the n with result and add the zeros counter variable

you have to multiplying both the width and the height by a constant and the scaled result of the multiplication should be less than 16777215

and don t use divide where multiplying will do multiplication is typically faster though not always

after analysing your code there is a final unsigned 32 bit integer overflow in the last multiplication by 10 you multiplying by 10 not by 2 so you can get up to four new bits in each multiplication making it easier for an overflow even if you do unsigned arithmetic which is recommended so you don t need to play with the signs

multiplying first is probably simpler than using floating point if you only want an integer result and if you know that the multiplication will never overflow


precedence higher numeric
either way your example with the numeric expression would multiplying by 3 first because multiplication has higher precedence than addition or subtraction

since multiplication has a higher precedence than subtraction you should subtract 0 to your digit character before multiplying it


division faster likely
if i make a mistake and multiplying a number by 1.0 instead of 1 and i do not use any compiler optimization then my multiplication will last much longer than multiplying a number by 1

in usual programming practice one wouldn t bother and simply multiplying by the floating-point representation of 180 ï because multiplication is so much faster than division

the code is written like this in the belief that a shifts and adds are significantly faster than multiplication and b the compiler doesn t know the best way to multiplying by ten

mathematically left shifting is the same as multiplying a number by a power of 2 but as the operation is done only by shifting it is much faster than doing multiplication

i believe that division would be faster than multiplying by the inverse since the inverse has to be calculated first then multiplication performed

note that i ve incorporated dshin s comment that multiplying is faster than division however the performance improvement is about 90 removing the binary search 10 multiplication vs

implementing multiplication is easier if you remember an shl operation performs the same operation as multiplying the specified operand by two

feel free to use non-mathematical symbols for this but since you re basically multiplying probabilities the multiplication symbol seemed more likely to give an intuitive idea for what is going on than incorporateprobability or somesuch.

if you re dividing or multiplying by a variable then it s likely that multiplication is slightly faster because the logic is generally more simple


dictionary	map---------------------------------------------------

faster 5-40ã loop
if it was any other language i feel like using a map would be faster but because it s javascript initializing a dictionary and then evaluating seems like it ll be slower than just doing a o n 2 loop

shows a dictionary running 5-40ã faster than a map in the very similar setting of counting the frequencies on ints as a function of the number of unique keys


object easier ids
i would like to transform this object and properties into a dictionary map to make it easier to iterate

but lastly unless i m missing something this would be easier with a map or an object used as a dictionary of ids


value common reverse
a dictionary might have more than one key map to one value or one key map to several values like chaining in a hasthtable eg twitter hashtag searches

data structure to implement reverse functionality of a dictionary that is more than one key map to a common value using python


std large operations
std map though is actually implemented in a way that many operations are slower than dictionary as its size gets large

i definitely wouldn t try introducing a new general-purpose type for use in python based on std map which has worse algorithmic complexity in time for many important operations andâ in at least some implementationsâ leaves some optimisations to the user that dictionary already has

for suitably large examples of each dictionary overcomes the constant factor by which it s slower than std map and will actually do operations like lookup insertion etc


better word tcl
if what you are making is a map from one word to another you might be better off with a dictionary

since you want to map some fields to others using a dictionary is a better choice than using a list

or if you ve got tcl 8.6 dictionary map is perhaps better


array copy implementation
the difference between a map and vector is a like an array while a map is more a dictionary of key value pairs

note my implementation of map on dictionary returns a copy of the dictionary to be more like the map method of array


noexcept	throw---------------------------------------------------

swift	objective-c---------------------------------------------------

versions information different
3- there are different ways to catch errors on different versions of swift and objective-c as described earlier in this answer

swift is clearer on versions releases and i keep asking myself if i am missing something related to objective-c since i can t find this information


use
i use objective-c more than swift

also note that i use objective-c more than swift


applications enterprise professional
writing swift 2.0 in my professional work my personal opinion is that it s indeed ready for enterprise applications -- maybe even more than objective-c ever were

as objective-c is the older programming language for ios or macos applications swift allows you to use those classes structs in your code


readable print
with swift the code is much more readable than with objective-c

objective-c print is more readable compared to swift


faster slower familiar
this article seems to suggest that this is possible by swizzling a fake location into apple s cllocationmanager class to be used by other apps but i am unfamiliar with the objective-c code more familiar with swift

the swift one is dramatically slower then objective-c implementation

usually i find swift s method naming to be cleaner than objective-c s but init methods can be an exception

i don t think that as of today you can run these tests and determine with any certainty whether swift 1.0 is faster or slower than objective-c

executable size of swift application is much bigger than size of objective-c application

the perf hit will be ridiculous i know apple say swift execute faster than objective-c but this is low level so it will be harmless

bottom line i would personally hesitate to draw any simple conclusions of swift is faster than objective-c or vice versa

it is possible for swift to be faster than pure objective-c in things that you would traditionally use c or c++ for anyway

in case it s helpful since you seem perhaps more familiar with objective-c than swift here s what your swift method would look like if we translated it back into objective-c

swift s compiler is also doing a lot more than objective-c s compiler considering swift is more strongly typed and does not required specifying imports among other things

still technically yes it appears that an all swift solution is roughly 2x slower than a swift + cocoa solution which should be roughly the same than objective-c + cocoa when compiled with equivalent options iirc

i m more familiar with objective-c than swift and haven t had a chance to test this yet but this should be close

as mentioned in the comments although its possible to use objective-c libraries in swift i wanted a more pure swift solution

my view is that if in some cases objective-c is faster than swift it doesn t mean that all over performance of swift is slower

the swift compiler is doing a lot more and is quite a bit newer than the objective-c compiler so it unlikely it will be as stable fast for quite some time

however i read that swift was the successor of objective-c and i would feel more comfortable with swift syntax

as craig revealed within the announcement of swift it is said to be faster than objective-c by far

wouldn t swift be slower than objective-c in this case since it is layered on top of it

i have tried many things already changing up a few things wrote in swift differently alternatively using a for instead of the built in contains in swift to see if that might be the problem but objective-c was still faster

although this is only for ios the main app portion will be built in react-native as i am more familiar with js swift objective-c are very new to me

fwiw the objective-c compiler also mangles names but swift s mangling is more intricate to allow for method overloading etc

i have a objective-c application working fine and smooth to be more comfortable with swift i decided to write the unit tests for this app in swift

if you are using something like paintcode or have large chunks of uikit code in swift change it to objective-c it compiles far faster

i did a couple of benchmarks between swift and objective-c and i found that in certain cases swift was faster and in other cases objective-c was faster

injecting code in a swift application is harder than it was for an objective-c application but it s still possible

some esoteric things you are used to with objective-c are harder to implement with swift

and also apple does might not confidently announce that swift is more faster than objective-c in all the cases

i m just adding this below in objective-c to make it clearer to beginners and those of us who refuse to learn swift syntax

im new to swift but i like it more than objective-c as it looks a bit like java does to me from syntax wise compared to objective-c

there are multiple reasons why the swift code is slower than the objective-c code

i m learning swift and much less familiar with objective-c but for the life of me i can t figure out how they are trying to achieve the goal stated as build list of encodings sorted and including only those with human readable names.

most importantly for your image processing app the compiler will optimize swift code to run faster than objective-c


better easier class
early this month i started learning swift as i found it fun and easier than objective-c

i don t know objective-c all that well and swift would be an easier transition i feel

on the other hand swift is easier to learn especially if you have objective-c background so it can be adopted during the time slowly and paralelly with using objective-c

swift is stricter about runtime type correctness than objective-c so duck typing alone is not enough

enumerations in swift 2 are much better then in objective-c

i m trying to make the conversion from objective-c to swift and have had better days

i admit javascript isn t my strong point and have a much easier time with objective-c and swift

objective-c is much more free and easy with types and compilation checks where swift isn t

then the buffers won t need to be treated as arrays of pointers and passing arrays of say floats between objective-c ++ and swift is easier

while objective-c was good at dynamic type inspection swift is much better of you allow the compiler to do the type checking at compile time

swift in that case would not be safer but less safe than objective-c

download xcode free and learn objective-c or swift swift is easier to learn than objective-c

swift is neither easier to read nor understand than objective-c

if you get a difference between swift and objective-c it s more because swift is probably better on optimisation

so i ve started learning swift because it looks way better than objective-c

we ve seen that swift uses a more static method dispatch than objective-c which unless a class dervices from foundation nsobject prevents the style of swizzling based on remapping method implementations at runtime

i suppose it sort of makes sense to do things this way except for the fact that metal appears to play better with objective-c even though it looks like swift

but we can assume that generics in objective-c were introduced for transitioning to swift and in that regard using swift directly is even better

swift also prevents us i believe from overriding a parent class s property but also still lets us observe changes to that property--this is much better than objective-c s approach

swift is lot smarter than objective-c about singleton class

i would be very interested in seing the solution in objective-c also but swift is more important for me here

objective-c s relatively lax type checking makes this easy to deal with but swift is stricter

it seems to me that swift would be way simpler to learn then objective-c for beginners i know because i learned it in like 2 months and swift is less complicated and better laid out then objective-c

after thinking about playing with it some more and reading some other posts using objective-c typedef in swift here is a better solution i think

or is it merely a hint to whatever tool converts between swift and objective-c to better deal with swift optionals

as you can see defining a singleton class in swift is much easier than in objective-c

i feel swift is better than objective-c in many aspects but my major question is - will swift dynamic libraries support older version of swift

note that swift s arrays are much more sensible than objective-c s

i know that swift enums are much more powerful than their objective-c equivalents

apple seems to claim that the optional type in swift is safer than nil in objective-c but i don t understand why this is so

better if you have a code swift is better but is not problem objective-c

so in swift just as in objective-c you had better make that delegate property weak because it would be terrible if one view controller suddenly took memory management ownership of another view controller


pow	sqrt---------------------------------------------------

fast implementation accurate
my question is is fast implementation of pow x 0.5f faster than fast sqrt x

first of all sqrt x should be faster and more accurate than pow x 0.5 why do you think it s in the library


viewdidappear	viewwillappear---------------------------------------------------

candidates time viewdidload
you may find using viewdidload rather than viewwillappear or viewdidappear may work better in this case you can set your view up with a loading holding graphic or animation trigger your asynchronous networking call and then once complete display the required information

it sounds like you want to do that every time the view appears so viewwillappear or viewdidappear seem like better candidates for your needs


128bit	64bit---------------------------------------------------

prime comment previous
and i ll just add to previous comment if 128bit number has prime factor larger than 64bit then it certainly has a factor less than 64bit

i ll just add that if the 128bit number is prime or has a prime factor larger than 64bit then there will be no solution to your problem


faster 32bit bit
actually on intel sandybridge-family at least mul imul 64bit 64bit 128bit is faster than imul mul 32bit 32bit 64bit

128bit transactions tend to be faster than 64bit which tend to be faster than 32 bit


wildfly	jboss---------------------------------------------------

client-side	server-side---------------------------------------------------

validation important user
not only is it a good learning language it is still a very useful language to know in regard to getting jobs and will remain so as both client-side and server-side javascript become more important

at this point i m putting off worrying about client-side validation since server-side is more important

client-side validation is more responsive to the user but always back it up with proper server-side checks

server-side validation is more secure than the client-side as the user cannot see the code even he does a view-source

how you handle things server-side is far more critical than client-side validation which can and will be ignored by malicious users


faster validation place
since you don t want to repeat yourself it s very tempting to put all your validation on one side or the other but there are tradeoffs either way and it is true that server-side validation is going to be slower than client-side

client-side validation is faster than server-side because the validation takes place on client side on browser and the networking time from client to server is saved

because merges are performed client-side they are much faster and less error-prone than initiating a server-side merge


script visitor reliable
ps again i am aware that relying on client-side script is way less secure compared with handling all execution from within the server-side

i am curious to know if detecting the visitor browser with client-side script is more reliable than server-side script


easier dom plug-in
but i was working on server-side and probably for client-side it s much easier

maintaining the focus client-side will be much easier than trying to force it through the server-side

this would be easier with server-side php plug-in s unless the file is loaded client-side

i think this method of manipulating the dom from the client-side is easier than using regex from a server-side language


data table fewer
i would advice to switch to server-side processing of table data instead of using client-side it is more preferable if your application works with a lot of rows more than several hundreds

i think the best way would be for you to write some clustering logic on the server-side and leave the client-side to deal with fewer data points


viewdidload	viewdidappear---------------------------------------------------

method difference better
you could try the block of code in the viewdidload method which is called earlier than viewdidappear

so viewdidload is called slightly earlier than viewdidappear the only difference is that when viewdidappear the view have been already drawn instead in viewdidload the view has still to be drawn

you may find using viewdidload rather than viewwillappear or viewdidappear may work better in this case you can set your view up with a loading holding graphic or animation trigger your asynchronous networking call and then once complete display the required information


salt	md5---------------------------------------------------

ip difficult random
hashing with sha md5 or any other algorithm solves the problem of key protection because you don t need to keep any secret value other than salt but salt is significantly less sensitive than encryption key

bcrypt is considered the most secure way to implement password hashing with salt because it is slow - much slower than an md5

an md5 encrypted password usually includes a random salt to make it more difficult to perform dictionary attacks

now personally i generally use a salt sha-256 hash on my passwords because i thought that md4 and md5 were no longer secure and that hashing a password multiple times would just put too much strain on a server for no practical benefit

encrypt the passwords with one-way encryption algorithm with a random salt like the common opinionï¼š sha-256 is stronger than md5

so md5 + strong password + average salt is better than usual password + phpass

so md5 + strong password + average salt is better than usual password + super-extra-cool_hash and quite enough

you can md5 or encrypt for better security the client ip using a secret salt + date and pass this as a parameter in iframe src url


sha256 good plain
you might like plain md5 or sha salt md5 or sha better or some time-consuming method like blowfish recommended

with a salt md5 is much more secure than without but you re better off using one of the sha hash such as sha256managed

4 md5 can be made more secure by using a salt

it is not better than md5 plus salt

using sha256 with a salt will be much more secure than md5

decode the passwords yourself and re-encode them with a salt i recommend something a little more fancy than md5

for the password hashing there are lots of discussions about this out also good answers on so you should probably move away from md5 and use a better salt

passwords stored as md5 without a salt are much more easily cracked

this uses pdo and prepared statements which patches the sql injection vulnerability in the most elegant way possible not mysql_real_escape_string and also uses bcrypt for hashing passwords which is infinitely better than one md5 with no salt


fftw	gsl---------------------------------------------------

background-image	background-color---------------------------------------------------

entities	entitymanager---------------------------------------------------

jqplot	flot---------------------------------------------------

opennlp	stanford-nlp---------------------------------------------------

results level ner
going forward for ner there as well stanford-nlp have the more accurate results compare to opennlp

but if you will look at the accuracy level stanford-nlp have more accurate detection than opennlp


mediacodec	mediarecorder---------------------------------------------------

multiplying	modulo---------------------------------------------------

rtp	rtsp---------------------------------------------------

confusing rtmp higher
the chance of receiving video streams over http is higher than rtsp rtp rtmp and so on

i think you re confusing rtp over http with rtsp over http and therefore rtp too see for more info


jquery	scriptaculous---------------------------------------------------

ironruby	ironpython---------------------------------------------------

rsa	dsa---------------------------------------------------

faster generation client
a dsa signature generation could be somewhat faster than a rsa signature generation maybe up to twice faster

the third operation is made much faster is the client uses a rsa key pair rsa signature verification is very fast whereas dsa signature verification is expensive actually somewhat more expensive than dsa signature generation


shorter level ones
dsa signatures are signficantly shorter than rsa ones

dsa and ecdsa both produce shorter signatures with much greater strength that rsa

eugene s suggestion of using ecc is a good one - ecc keys are much shorter than rsa or dsa for a given security level


slower testing
i have made some testing and it came out that rsa is lot slower than dsa

this is why rsa is much slower than dsa


equivalent smaller independent
for the signature part you may want to use dsa or ecdsa they yield much shorter signatures typically 320 bits for a dsa signature of security equivalent to a 1024-bit rsa signature

dsa has signature that is independent of key strength and is much smaller than rsa signature for equivalent security rsa 1024 1568 vs dsa 192


youtube	vimeo---------------------------------------------------

faster choices plattforms
youtube and vimeo are probably better choices if you want your videos to be visible to the widest possible audience

youtube and vimeo definitely have a better bandwidth than your hosting company

video plattforms like youtube or vimeo are faster and would bring this options with them


mp4	webm---------------------------------------------------

pbkdf2	hash---------------------------------------------------

natural cost size
use a larger hash pbkdf2 can generate more than the output of the hash as bytes but only at the cost of security

i recommend against using pbkdf2 to derive more than the natural output size size of the underlying hash


firefox	safari---------------------------------------------------

lower greater several
in safari it is several pixels higher up than in firefox and google-chrome and significantly lower in opera

in firefox it seems that this is 1px lower than in google-chrome and safari

so to specify firefox greater than 20 safari greater than 9.1 and ie greater than 9


issue strict implementation
also i m guessing that firefox ignores this issue and just and compensates for it while safari may be more strict in its implementation of the code so it doesn t compensate

with firefox google-chrome and safari it s less of an issue because those started auto-updating years ago and more than two years ago they stopped blocking methods other than get and post

it seems that google-chrome internet explorer or safari are more strict than firefox on terms of security


older safe insertadjacenthtml
well unless you re targeting older than google-chrome 1.0 firefox 8.0 ie 4.0 opera 7.0 or safari 4.0 it s safe to use insertadjacenthtml

firefox and safari follow an older flexbox specification and look best when the lists have a balanced number of items


footer reports smaller
that i gave to every link in the set of links home about us products contact and it seems that firefox is making that 1px margin much bigger than safari or google-chrome and distorting it

open up the fiddle in both firefox google-chrome to see what i m talking about - in firefox the positioning of the background image is much lower than in google-chrome safari

this is because in ie and firefox the footer link text is larger than in google-chrome and safari therefore the margins that i ve set up for the icons do not work

while the rest of the browsers report the correct width of the document firefox reports a smaller one example at screen resolution of 1920x1080 ie google-chrome and safari reports 1920 while firefox reports 1903


better browsers closer
browsers devices desktop browsers ie8+ google-chrome firefox safari ipad s browser mobile safari mobile devices browsers android mobile safari

to me it looks like safari gets it more right than firefox text is generally more around a middle line

i am using franklin gothic font for website and font looks good on google-chrome and safari but on internet explorer and mozilla firefox it looks darker

basically the way google-chrome renders text looks ugly and i want it to look like or almost like firefox or safari which looks thinner and better

therefore code should be written and tested around firefox google-chrome safari which are much closer to proper standards support than ie8 then conditional tags should be used in ie to work around its bugs

after that ie slows down at exponential rate when firefox google-chrome and safari are doing much better

font looks sharp in google-chrome safari ie8 not as good as other 2 but less fuzzy than firefox

if you are trying to support all users on all browsers then you will certainly need to do testing on those browsers although actively developing on those browsers may not be necessary whereas if you only need to support webkit-based browsers google-chrome safari or webkit-based browsers and firefox that is less testing that you need to do

firefox is just better for web development and i prefer safari overall

safari behaves better than firefox but an error message â œone error in opening the pageâ â shows up in the status bar if you remove the iframe during the load event

it displays ok in google-chrome and safari but in firefox it has more space between the text and the bottom border than between the text and the top border

your links are all held within a table missing its starting tag but tables are not supported in all document types and perhaps firefox and safari are guessing better

usually you want to avoid solutions from browser-vendor as they ll cater toward that specific browser but opera webkit google-chrome safari firefox devs are usually more knowledgeable in terms of cross-browser solutions and compliance with the standards than m ones

in ie and firefox fullscreen_block appears closer to the bottom than in safari and google-chrome

i planned on using svgs for the entire site but with only 20-30 svg images of medium to high complexity used in the page and google-chrome already seems to be showing som jank and high paint times for scroll and firefox is even worse though safari seems to do a lot better

it s way faster on ie but other major browsers firefox google-chrome safari and opera perform better when using a container and then appending it fragment or div

firefox internet explorer and safari have better options though

now i recognized that safari make more problems then the other browsers like google-chrome or firefox

whether you use a plugin or write your own code css only is a no go for google-chrome safari and as you said firefox is better at dealing with it

the service is still in beta trial and firefox conversion is working better than safari one

secondly the browsers above ie7 and other browsers like firefox google-chrome and safari have a better rendering engine and intuitively handle buggy markup

all the webkit-based browsers safari google-chrome and opera should be closer in their rendering to each other than firefox or ie 9 separately

browsers like firefox and safari are better at line numbers but they are generally pointless due to minification of the files

please especially test on safari because it has some more problems than firefox and google-chrome

this does not seem to occur in safari or ie and a similar permission error occurs sometimes in firefox but is reproducible more often than not in google-chrome


better great worse
firefox google-chrome opera and safari all handle it better

at least in firefox and safari it looks much better

it works great in google-chrome and safari haven t tested ie but i m sure it s somehow worse than firefox


page unusable iframed
safari and opera work with the google-chrome setting but firefox and ie display the iframed page larger than google-chrome causing part of the text to be cut off

ie is less performant than safari google-chrome and firefox when it comes to js - but have you really developed a page that is unusable in ie with js turned on


fine urls ribbon
now this works fine in google-chrome and safari and i have had to use assitional css settings for firefox but ie and opera both display my ribbon div about 25px higher than in google-chrome or safari

pc google-chrome and safari are fine ie shows the links like in the picture firefox shows more revealed urls


html5 stronger market
firefox safari google-chrome and opera make up more than 30 of the market and they support many html5 standards

firefox 4+ and safari 5+ have much stronger html5 support and don t require the above css.


menu wider background
the html tables on my site look nice and the way i intend them to in safari firefox google-chrome but look far wider than the set pixel size in ie

firefox renders the video correctly and it matches the background and in safari it s always brighter whether you add the filter or not

in safari the background of my menu navigation drop-down menu s is much wider than in google-chrome firefox

solved the problem came from css specificity.bootstrap s css was judged more specific by google-chrome regarding my menu s selector but not by firefox and safari


faster slower mac
firefox google-chrome safari all have prioritized faster javascript execution in recent versions whereas ie may show performance in ie9 i hope they do myself. also realize this slideshow will run slow in mobile devices etc

i think it s simply because google-chrome firefox safari etc. are faster browsers

then ie seems to be reasonable but cant be faster than firefox or safari

in ie java-script load slower than firefox safari and google-chrome

fast clicking on ie has slower response than firefox google-chrome and safari

incidentally the scrolling on the windows version of safari is fine albeit a little slower than ie opera and firefox

on safari everything is slower than on firefox still the object property access is more than two times faster

in safari we found that the dom level 0 took twice the time off the dom level 2 but was still four times faster than either firefox case

safari 4.0.3 was 2.5x faster than tracemonky in firefox 3.5.3 on win xp

to my surprise firefox 6 and safari 5 are faster just adding a bunch of strings together than using .join

google-chrome or safari on a mac could be much faster than firefox on a pc especially with newer apis

it looks like at least on safari and firefox prototype runs significantly faster edit not 20x as stated earlier

because of how google-chrome s plugin system works development mode in google-chrome is much slower than in firefox or safari see here for more details

when i try the demo in google-chrome or safari it is indeed much faster but when i ve tested it in firefox it s consistently slower

conclusion diff1 is faster in firefox opera and safari diff2 is faster in ie and google-chrome

this makes firefox 50x faster than google-chrome and 70x faster than safari is there any known reason for that


textview	imageview---------------------------------------------------

subtitletextview button fixed
i have a button that is bottom constrained to the bottom of the imageview however should be top constrained to the bottom of the subtitle textview if subtitletextview is taller than imageview

i have an imageview that is bigger than a textview and i want to center the textview on top of the imageview both vertically and horizontally

assuming the imageview is always bigger than the textview it ll drive the parent height

the imageview is bit taller than the textview and so what i do is add padding margins to the bottom of textview to get it align and look like the imageview and textview horizontal centers are aligned

the button itself has an elevation greater than the imageview and textview so even though they are defined after the button they will still be below it in elevation and be invisible

in the image the square represents a fixed size imageview the rectangle is a textview which can 1 line smaller height than imageview or multiline height is larger than imageview

textview have higher z order than imageview

if the textview might be bigger make sure to center the imageview as well

i also tried to do spacing from imageview to textview but then if the textview is smaller than the imageview the spacing will be wrong again

i have a larger view with a textview and an imageview inside of it

however the imageview has a smaller width than the textview

this should work as long as the imageview is larger than the textview in all dimensions

i tried constraints spacing each imageview with xdp it is ok if all textview are not higher than the imageview but if a textview is higher than a imageview it will overlap

i try to align my imageview and my textview but the imageview is higher than my textview

for api 18 and earlier the margin is being applied after the alignment so if the margin in the imageview is greater than 0 you will get your textview moved

make textview lower than imageview


40dip cleaner closer
use compound drawables - a linearlayout which contains an imageview and a textview can be more efficiently handled as a compound drawable

i want to set imageview and textview on same line in linearlayout but the imageview is always higher than the textview

i have tried to put my imageview in a linearlayout and put a weight on it but if my imageview is smaller i have a blank between the imageview and the textview

a linearlayout which contains an imageview and a textview can be more efficiently handled as a compound drawable

the refresh works fine and i get the refreshed data but the images within swiperefreshlayout cardview textview imageview .. are getting smaller and smaller with each new refresh

i have an issue i m creating a uiview that is returned from a method and that part is fine but what i ve noticed is that when i add sublayers to one of the subviews those layers overlap subviews that are higher up in the hierarchy textview and imageview the sublayers added to testviewcopy are appearing over top of these subviews and they aren t supposed to

but the android guide says use compound drawables - a linearlayout which contains an imageview and a textview can be more efficiently handled as a compound drawable

the imageview should be closer to left margin and the textview with tel should be closer to image

i got the middle textview to fill up what s left and some extra - leaving the left imageview to be smaller than the 40dip i ve set it to be

i m having a problem displaying the layout when my imageview and textview takes up more than 3 4 of the screen

a linearlayout which contains an imageview and a textview can be more

i usually do this with nested linearlayouts containing a textview and imageview for the icon but obviously using these compound textview is cleaner


richfaces	icefaces---------------------------------------------------

ajax better easy
richfaces looks more good option to work than icefaces bcoz it has inbuilt support its easy to learn its long time support guarantee for seam+richfaces combination

richfaces has better ajax support than icefaces

icefaces provides more good looking components than richfaces


dplyr	tidyr---------------------------------------------------

jdom	xom---------------------------------------------------

libraries apis xml
you might find that other tree apis like jdom xom and dom4j are more to your liking

there are libraries that build on the xml apis jdom dom4j or xom which are easier to use than the raw apis


jasmine	qunit---------------------------------------------------

rar	zip---------------------------------------------------

better
it s much better compressing than zip rar

one reason to use rar it is sooooo much better than zip


pandas	dask---------------------------------------------------

mdpi	hdpi---------------------------------------------------

range 48x48 type
if the screens density is less than xhdpi i load smaller sampled sizes of the 96x96 image - as 36x36 for ldpi 48x48 for mdpi 72x72 for hdpi

if you re diligent about making graphics for at least the main three densities ldpi mdpi and hdpi then you should not see over-large icons except where the screens is physically smaller than your layout expects it

try placing youre images in res mdpi they will be streched to fit screens which are bigger hdpi xhdpi

first of all if you anyhow provide a hdpi graphic adding an mdpi and ldpi graphic which both are less than the hdpi graphic in size there is approximately 3 4 6 scaling ratio will increase the size but far from triple it more close to double

ldpi assets will look bad on high density screens but are exponentially smaller than mdpi which is exponentially smaller than hdpi etc

now a days most of the devices at least fall under hdpi range mdpi ldpi are being less popular now

images in these different folders should have different physical pixel sizes mdpi has smaller images than hdpi but the images pixel densities aren t used

and you know your image at hdpi folder so its 1.5 larger than the mdpi

a hdpi image on a ldpi screens would appear larger than the same image on a mdpi or hdpi screens

a ldpi image on a hdpi screens would appear smaller than the same image on a mdpi or ldpi screens

i have found that delivering your application with already scaled images having ldpi mdpi hdpi is the better approach

your normal sized image should be optimized for mdpi 160dpi while the ldpi image is 25 smaller 120dpi and the hdpi image is 50 larger 240dpi

if in java code the values would be in pixels so 50px on mdpi screens will look larger than on hdpi screens

in my android app i have a background image which is longer than the screens width for all the three types of screens.this implies that i have got 3 drawables each for different screens type mdpi ldpi hdpi and hence i have included a horizontal scroll bar in my app

when you put images into hdpi folder their appearance is smaller than from mdpi and ldpi

proportionally the hdpi screens is slightly taller than the mdpi screens

each device has a density like hdpi ldpi and mdpi tablet have even more

even if i create three versions for ldpi mdpi and hdpi there are more than screens resolutions in that table if there is no matching image it will scale my image and may not retain the aspect ratio


layout-sw720dp-land layout-sw320dp-land drawables
owing to the fact that the screens density on the tablet is smaller android therefore uses the images in the mdpi folder for the tablet and the slightly bigger ones in the hdpi folder for the phone

layout-sw320dp-land will pick up drawable from hdpi folder whereas layout-sw720dp-land is mdpi device so it will pick up drawables from mdpi folder which will be smaller than hdpi


jdom	dom4j---------------------------------------------------

dom libraries apis
there are many tree representations of xml available in the java world jdom xom dom4j that are vastly more usable than dom

you might find that other tree apis like jdom xom and dom4j are more to your liking

there are libraries that build on the xml apis jdom dom4j or xom which are easier to use than the raw apis


backtracking	greedy---------------------------------------------------

ansible	puppet---------------------------------------------------

general cfengine agent
ansible unlike chef and puppet uses agent less run

puppet chef ansible cfengine are more general configuration management tools that can be used on almost all linux os-es


d3.js	raphael---------------------------------------------------

place browsers fallback
the only place where raphael defeats d3.js is fallback raphael supports older versions of ie where as d3.js is based on current web standards ie 9

this should be possible maybe be aware snap.svg isn t so compatible with older browsers in which case you could look at raphael which is snaps older brother d3.js is very well established as well

raphael supports older versions of ie whereas d3.js is based on current web standards


vim	sublimetext---------------------------------------------------

primefaces	richfaces---------------------------------------------------

research jsf part
i haven t tried any of these in a jsf 2 application but i would recommend using the primefaces one at least the documentation is better than richfaces

i did my part of the research and found out that either richfaces or primefaces would be better but most of my applications were developed using icefaces


datediff	difference---------------------------------------------------

hour seconds difficult
datediff becomes more difficult to use as you have more dateparts in your difference in your case looks like minutes and seconds

for example if the start time was 8 55 and the end time 9 05 datediff hour ... would return 1 although the actual difference is much less just 10 minutes


narrow period greater
how to calculate datediff between two dates if difference is greater than 35 days

generally you can use datediff to specify more narrow period if you would like this difference to be less than 10 days you could use


aggregate-functions	sum---------------------------------------------------

answer version general
as an added answer there is also the aggregate-functions which is more general than sum

aggregate-functions is more general version of sum


xrange	enumerate---------------------------------------------------

faster slower lst
why is enumerate slower than xrange + lst i

i m not sure that one way or the other enumerate or xrange will be significantly faster or better since i think lists store their length in a variable so it can be quickly accessed without counting through the list elements


keras	tensorflow---------------------------------------------------

optimizers equivalent model
is keras consumes more gpu memory than equivalent tensorflow model training

more than this methodology i would suggest to you to do the training directly in keras as it claimed that keras optimizers are 5-10 times faster than tensorflow s optimizers


slower 19x backend
should i be surprised that the keras theano backend is about 18x - 19x slower than the keras tensorflow backend

is keras faster slower than tensorflow during training


junit	testng---------------------------------------------------

testing framework integration
also for integartion testing i have found testng to be much easier to use that junit because it has features that make writing integration tests easier

if you re doing non-unit testing testng might be a better option than junit

my suggestion would be to try to use a testing framework testng or junit which gives many more features than just parametrization

testng has more capabilities and can be helpful with integration tests junit is more focused on unit tests

in case if you have flexibility to choose another testing framework you can try with testng which has bigger feature set than junit

you may want to use junit in the part of unit testing but testng is more than a unite testing framework

twip for parameterized testing the junit stuff isn t the greatest in fact testng does this better as well -

i actually picked junit over testng for android testing i thought it was more lightweight than testng for on-device testing


options comparisons order
i have read some comparisons of junit and testng and it looks like testng has more configuration options

testng offers you more options and possibilites how to run your tests and in which order especially something junit can t


work easier honest
not sure if it ll work any better than junit but there is testng

i know this can be achieved with junit but in my experience it is easier with testng

isn t testng supposed to a better than junit

testing with scalatest+scalacheck is much much better than junit testng

to be perfectly honest i junit is way more popular than testng at least here where i work and live

if you are familiar of using junit it is easier to switch into testng

powermockito might integrate a little easier with testng but i have never used it with junit


solution params similar
if there is a junit extension or similar framework that provides a better solution than testng then please let me know

go with junit params or testng which offer much more convenient solution


arraylist	treeset---------------------------------------------------

sort effective
so arraylist and sort is more effective than treeset

so i expected that treeset would be more effective then arraylist


crypt	salt---------------------------------------------------

actionscript	mxml---------------------------------------------------

relevant non-programmers hood
i would say pure actionscript is better for programming whether you use flash ide or flex ide is not that relevant and mxml is better for non-programmers to combine the components programmed in as

so yes it can be used with flash or rather pure actionscript but it is a little less convenient than with mxml where everything is set up by the framework because it takes more under the hood configuration to be able to run all the necessary parts for remoting


twig	smarty---------------------------------------------------

functionality new symfony
if your in the market for a templating engine twig a new templating engine used by symfony is much better than smarty imho

either way i intend to use smarty partly because i have lots of experience with it and partly because its much more well documented and has much more functionality than blade and to me the syntax is slightly cleaner than twig although the template engine is not the point of this question really


many-to-many	one-to-many---------------------------------------------------

relations better associations
one-to-many and many-to-many relationships require more care since overuse of them can cause performance problems

using two one-to-many associations is always better than relying on many-to-many relations


vb.net	vb6---------------------------------------------------

pixel refreshing net
fortunately vb.net finally ended all that and is completely pixel based you can still alter you viewport scaling but .net seems to handle that much better than vb6

the time and energy you spend refreshing your knowledge of vb6 would be far better spent on learning vb.net


c use point
biggest of all is that adding new features to your vb6 application is more expensive than it would be if the application was in a better language like c# or vb.net

if you don t already know vb6 there s little point in learning it now - your time could be put to much better use by learning vb.net c#

vb.net is a better language than vb6 use its com capabilities to save you from writing endless sketchy vb6 code

coming from familiarity with vb6 c# and vb.net are the same on the back end and vb.net would be a better choice for you i prefer c# if you care


differences strict project
none of the .net libraries are there and there are some syntax differences as vb.net is more strict than vb6 is

if you have to maintain or transfer an older project then the differences between vb6 and vb.net are much more serious


rsa	aes---------------------------------------------------

performance first hungry
there are two reasons for that performance aes is faster then rsa and resources aes is less resource hungry than rsa

and regarding your first question it is definitely possible to encrypt decrypt messages directly using rsa there are only technical and performance reasons aes is much faster than rsa why rsa is used only to encrypt a session key and aes is used to encrypt decrypt the messages themselves


public small different
but if you use public key encryption to encrypt messages you are a limited to small messages -- a 1024 bit rsa key encrypts less than 128 bytes and b going to pay in performance because public key encryption is much more costly than symmetric key encryption such as aes encryption

generally public key algorithms rsa need much larger keys than symmetric key algorithms aes because they rely on different mathematical properties


slower faster algorithm
the aes key is encrypting much more data but is much faster than rsa encryption

rsa is not ment for bulk encryption as it s quit slow compared to symmetric algorithms like aes it s more than a factor of 1000 slower

execution of aes is more faster than rsa for same key sizes

it shows that rsa encrypt is faster then aes encrypt

rsa will be slower than a symmetric cypher like rijndael or aes

rsa is much slower than aes

like you heard asymmetric cryptography like rsa is much slower than symmetric cryptography aes but it does have it s advantages simpler key management a single private key to protect

if you want the entire communication to be secure not only sending username password you can use a symmetric cipher algorithm aes because asymmetric cipher algorithms rsa are much slower and consume more resources

so the 115 seconds will be reduced to 3-4 secs plus the encryption decryption time used for aes which is much faster than rsa

one of the reasons to do so is that rsa is much slower than for example aes

you could use rsa but a symmetric algorithm like aes is faster if you can find a way to exchange keys in a secure way


secure
asymmetric key encryption ex rsa is no more secure than symmetric key encryption ex aes

how is aes less secure than rsa in this scenario

asymmetric encryption ex rsa is no more secure than symmetric encryption ex aes


perl	tcl---------------------------------------------------

sudo	passwd---------------------------------------------------

unicorn	webrick---------------------------------------------------

personal faster better
my personal experience is that webrick is faster in my development environment than unicorn and thin os x in a pretty big rails app lots of gems routes etc

in production it is much better to use a more sophisticated server like phusion passenger or unicorn since they have better performance than thin mongrel or webrick


width	margin---------------------------------------------------

auto element non-inline
if you specify a width to the table centering with margin 0 auto will also work as long as the specified width is less than that of the containing block

how to place 2 div side by side one div is of 75 width and the other is 25 width.one more div with margin 0 auto

margin auto won t center an element horizontally unless you also set a width that s less than 100

then give it a width that s less than the width of your li and add margin auto to center it

span is an inline element and the margin 0 auto for centering only works on non-inline elements that have a width that is less than 100

margin auto when used in conjunction with a width that is less than 100 of the screen will center an element

it is a much better way than fixed width and margin auto

for width i can use margin 0 auto but height is trickier because it would need to make a div absolute

image s width is less than div s width i can use margin auto here


right greater div
give the sample text div a right margin greater than the width of the right-floated element

the .content class has a white background adds padding and a margin all around the span10 offset1 div to make the width appear smaller

the width padding and margin together make it so that the total width of the element is larger than the width of the screen

the yellow box my basic goal was to make the heart a bit smaller than the width of the yellow box center it horizontally within and give the heart some top margin

the the main content div needs to have left margin larger than the width of your sidebar

you can try giving an id to each one of the divs or style them for margin that is greater than or equal to the image width.assuming you image width is 50px this code shall work

when i check the following code in the chrome devtools device toolbar responsive and the window gets smaller than 1040px width the .wrapper suddenly get s an increasing right margin until 60px

the div s width is smaller than the images width so i have used overflow hidden and by the images margin 0 -100 but this way only the first image is set middle the second

what i want it to do is to center a given image from a database into a div for example if the given images width is bigger than height it echos it with a left margin

the box is never too small infact the margin of the adjacent div is bigger than the width of ul div

you will have to set the width of #divmain to be smaller than 720px 500px - the only way for a child to be centered horizontally within its parent using margin 0 auto is for the parent s width to be larger

basically if it can scale to 100 height of the parent container margin padding included without the width becoming bigger than the parent container s let it scale up

now if the div with has margin 660px from the left it should be hidden because it s margin is higher than the maximum width of the main container

but i don t want to put a margin on every 2nd item because when the browser width becomes smaller there will be 2 or even 1 items in a row

so when your window width is less than 959px your image will have width 100 but also the padding and margin pushing it to the right

i added a margin so that the iframe will stay centered in the div once the width is shorter

i just made the left margin of div2 greater than the width of div1 and it worked for me

the reason why your website is x-scrollable on all devices is that you forgot to add to and the row inside it has 100 +15px left margin +15px right margin which is bigger than window width

the div width of 50 plus the margin made it larger than 50 so they just stacked

on the linked example they used a wrapper outside the nav .navbar-wrapper with an absolute placement and a top margin of 20px when the viewport width is larger than 768px

one way of doing this is checking if left margin of the inner div is lesser than the width of sidebar and then only add class adjust

the width of the span content plus the left margin is greater than 1000px and so it wraps spans to the next line

gives a way to make the margin transparent but they are still there and the plot is smaller than height and width i set in the saved file

to render in pdf correctly body width + left margin + right margin must be less than or equal to page width

when i add a margin to the divs the width becomes smaller and the height stays the same so the aspect ratio changes

the problem is when i use margin it will affect them both since they have same class so the second div will go below the other because the total width will become bigger than the container width

the title goes in a h1 for example and the text in a p or div so set these two elements to have a left margin greater than the width of image a

if the content leads to a width that is less than 100 of the table s containing block then setting the left right margin to auto will center the table within the containing block

by giving the middle indicators div a left and right margin slightly larger than the width of the left and right button divs you allow it to float up between the two and take up as much space as possible

since you float the content to the left and the sidebar to the right changing the margin won t have an effect unless maybe it gets bigger than the available width of the gap but certainly not while the margin is smaller than the gap that is already there

a common solution is to float your fixed-width column left or right and give the other column a margin equal or greater than the width of the fixed-width column

therefore assuming the container s width is greater than the image s height margin -50 0 should be enough

the width and height you provided should be greater than amount of padding for example summing top and bottom margin 18 + 18 36px so height should be greater than 36px same goes for height

to do that the div must have a width smaller than the width of the parent container of course it must be display block and have margin 0 auto

how to calculate element s width and height with their padding margin values using less code

provided that the #topnav s width is greater than the width of the or else you can t center it you need to set a width to the in order for an auto margin to work

but if the screen width is less than 200 then it will be from left view edge margin to right view edge margin.

assuming this is the fix you are looking for your container needs to have a width greater than the width of the button and from there you can add margin 0 auto

in that case the uilabel s width must be smaller so the left right margin will always be 30

it must also have a width that is smaller than its containing block for the auto value to make sense - because #container is spanning the width of its parent the there is simply no margin to distribute


sides inches report
if report width is 8 inches and 0.5 inches margin on both sides body width should be slightly less than 7 inches 6.95 inches

i would like that if the width is smaller than 540px the input fields automatically resize to full width with a margin of 10px at both sides


110px browser 40px
the browser automatically sets a start-margin and end-margin etc to like 40px that s why when you scale down 45 width 2 90 and the browser margin would be much more than 10 that s why it didn t work

if browser width is more than 768px then set a 110px margin


position 960px max-width
at the beggining i d like to explain my problem well i ve got main container body where width is auto and min-width is 960px width of screen can be bigger than children width there s child container where margin is auto and width 960px

you need to center position of .panel_big by using margin auto and better use width 100 with max-width of 670px when browser width will be smaller than 670px .panel_big will start to fit its width to browser width


css top re-sized
essentially my logic is when the window is re-sized and the width is less than 810px then remove all css styling and add margin top items 2 through infinity

why is css adding more than 2.5 margin from the top when only the width is increased


x2 1px x
instead of the reaching 100 width the margin is causing less width for them due to the 20px x 12

the divsquare width is define 48 less than 50 because the 4px margin and 1px x2 border occupy space too


query media contents
when the screen width becomes larger than 500px the contents of the media query are ignored and the margin becomes 20

if you have a div that takes up most of the screen except for the 20 margin on the left and you want that margin to be no less than 100px then you can use a media query to set the margin to 100px when the frame width becomes less than 500px 20 of 500px is 100px


mp3	wav---------------------------------------------------

likely codec engine
it is likely that wav is using a more compressive codec such as mp3 or ogg internally

it is a high level 2d and 3d cross platform windows mac os x linux sound engine and audio library which plays wav mp3 ogg flac mod xm it s3m and more file formats and is usable in c++ and all .net languages c# visualbasic.net etc


smaller files problems
you should definitely pick mp3 because they are about 10x smaller than wav files of the same duration

so when you convert a file from wav to mp3 you get a smaller file but you lose audio quality

i am looking for a good new component that offers more help with wav and mp3 files too but not found what i am looking for yet

now i assume you are worried your techno might not read a compressed mp3 which should be smaller than a wav from my memories

ok i am new to audio with unity but despite reading all the unity posts regarding audio adding 2 short .wav clips i heard wav was smaller than mp3 to my app has added over 200mb

if you are still having problems jdk 8 has the ability to play mp3 files which are significantly smaller than wav you may want to try this

i understand that mp3 is much smaller but it has worst audio quality when is compared to wav files

wav files are about 3 times larger than mp3 files so it would need 1.8gb additional space to do the conversion


mp2 aiff custom
its purpose is to provide developers with powerful and efficient sample stream mp3 mp2 mp1 ogg wav aiff custom generated and more via os codecs and add-ons mod music xm it s3m mod mtm umx mo3 music mp3 ogg compressed mods and recording functions

its purpose is to provide developers with powerful and efficient sample stream mp3 mp2 mp1 ogg wav aiff custom generated and more via add-ons mod music xm it s3m mod mtm umx mo3 music mp3 ogg compressed mods and recording functions


data time-domain pcm
either way applying gain and or attenuation to time-domain sample data as in a wav file is much easier than trying to apply these effects to frequency-domain data as in an mp3 file

if you ask if a uncompressed wav which contains pcm data is better than mp3 then yes but the question sometimes is how much this better really matters to the human ear and how much postprocessing you have to perform on that data


libstdc++	libc++---------------------------------------------------

gcc pnacl clang
in crystax ndk both gnu libstdc++ and llvm libc++ are much more stable and fully conforming to c++ standard at least at the same level as they conform to it on gnu linux

note that there s much more than llvm and clang these compilers also rely on c++ standard libraries both have libc++ libc++abi mostly unchanged pnacl used to support libstdc++ c standard libraries both have musl pnacl also has newlib bionic some form of glibc compiler runtime compiler-rt linker and general user libraries such as sdl part of emscripten and for pnacl in webports

if you want to use c++11 you either need to use clang with libc++ or install a newer gcc to get a newer libstdc++


gam	mgcv---------------------------------------------------

listview	gridview---------------------------------------------------

faster scrolling work
i tried replacing the gridview with a listview and the scrolling of the listview is much faster

listview gridview is more work but is faster


better control table
here s another article that describes the listview control and why it s probably a better fit than the gridview

if you have scenarios where you need more control over how the table is rendered the listview would be better choice but based on what you said simple tables i would recommend the gridview

it will produce the desired layout with a gridview but indeed the asp listview is a better choice

then depending on your needs a multi-item control such as a listbox listview or gridview might be even better for logs

i think using a gridview is better for your case than a listview

i think the listview is better than gridview in this situation

templating rows like this is possible in a gridview but the listview control is much better suited to this type of data

listview much better than the gridview dataview in that they let you write out clean html

i m trying to convert a gridview to a listview to allow me more control over the table display

if a listview or gridview is a better approach i am open to that as well

btw if this hyperlink is not in a databound control like listview or gridview it is far better to set the property from the code behind

i believe gridview allows much finer grained control of display than does listview


easier time scrollable
you may also consider using a listview which is easier to customize than the gridview

i wasn t able to find out how to do it and since i didn t have more time i decided to go with a listview and a gridview which was actually easier to achieve

if you can get away with it gridview and listview can be much easier to work with using adapters such as arrayadapter and cursoradapter

now i want parent of listview and gridview is scrollable but gridview and listview are not so that listview can show more than 2 items at a time


screen expandablelistview scrollview
else if you have more than one listview or gridview in the scrollview you need to create a customlistview

now what i want to achieve is like if the expandablelistview or the gridview items are more than what fits in the screen then on scrolling up on the listview or gridview the toolbar should hide and show if scrolled down the toolbar should visible

interpreted-language	compiled-language---------------------------------------------------

easier bytecode possible
an interpreted-language surely makes it easier but this is still entirely possible with compiled-language like c

while java could be described as a compiled and interpreted-language it s probably easier to think of java itself as a compiled-language and java bytecode as an interpreted-language


slower faster execution
from what i know a compiled-language such as c++ is much faster than an interpreted-language such as javascript

interpreted-language tend to be but not always are significantly slower than compiled-language

interpreted-language execution speed are slower than compiled-language true but once there is need for more speed you can call in compiled stuff through gems or micro services

php is an interpreted-language so will run a little slower than a compiled-language

that being said a compiled-language like c will almost always be faster than an interpreted-language like javascript

this makes interpreted-language generally slower than compiled-language due to the overhead of running the vm or interpreter

while ruby and python are both interpreted-language and operation-for-operation slower than compiled-language the reality is in executing an application only a small portion of cpu time is spent in your code and the majority is spent into the built-in libraries you call into which are often native implementations and thus are as fast as compiled code

in my general programming experience compiled c c++ programs generally run faster than most other compiled-language like java or even compiled python and almost always run faster than interpreted-language like uncompiled python or javascript

python is an interpreted-language so by definition is slower than other compiled-language but the drawback in the execution speed is not even noticeable in most of applications

an interpreted-language will typically run one to two orders of magnitude slower than a compiled-language

fact is that interpreted-language like php are always slower than a compiled-language

a compiled-language will generally run faster than an interpreted-language so i think ruby and php start behind the eight ball but it really comes down to how you use the language and how you structure the code

it should be noted that interpreted-language are inherently many time slower than natively compiled-language

java seeks to find a compromise between a purely compiled-language with no portability and a purely interpreted-language that is significantly slower

so compiled-language are faster in execution as at the time of execution no compilation is required but in interpreted-language each execution step is preceded by a compilation step every time making it slow

this is a good question but should be formulated a little different in my opinion for example why are interpreted-language slower than compiled-language

there is no way an interpreted-language can be faster than a compiled-language or even a jit language under trivial conditions

naturally interpreted-language will run slower than compiled-language as compiled code can be ran blindly by the cpu where as compiled code needs to be checked ran line by line

and perl like any interpreted-language is much slower than a compiled-language

mostly interpreted-language are a bit slower compared with compiled-language but i guess the difference is almost negligible in coffeescript javascript because of node.js

of course c++ or any compiled-language will be faster than an interpreted-language but you also have to take in account the development time of the web site app


performant operations level
interpreted-language are inherently less performant than compiled-language - c will generally outperform python - some operations more than others

then c which is one those languages closer to the processor level is very performant and generally speaking compiled-language because they turn your code into assembly language are more performant than interpreted-language


better performance examples
writing in a compiled-language java or c++ in your examples would almost certainly give better performance than an interpreted-language like php

performance of programs in compiled-language is significantly better than that of an interpreted-language

when i m done with this program it is suppose to display all palindrome and all primes palindrome that are greater than 100 and less than the number input by the user

i am trying to print a primes palindrome which is greater or equal to a given number t


division	subtraction---------------------------------------------------

cheaper weaker operation
the division operation binds tighter than i.e is evaluated ahead of the subtraction so you are taking a square root of a negative number

this is called a strength reduction operation because subtraction is a weaker and cheaper operation than division


precedence range multiplication
the operations are always algebraically simple never involving anything more than addition multiplication subtraction division and taking powers

it is also possible to manipulate the inputs so that various parts of the calculation return 0 for addition or subtraction or 1 for multiplication or division to make testing easier but this only gets me so far

multiplication division and modulo have the same precedence and they all have higher precedence than addition and subtraction

multiplication and division have higher priority than addition and subtraction

to start with i need multiplication and division to take higher precedence than addition and subtraction

i know the basics division and multiplication higher than addition and subtraction but i would have to look up something more esoteric

apart from that multiplication is addition done more than once and division is subtraction done more than once

it will be much slower i don t have benchmarks but i would guess at least an order of magnitude maybe more decimal will not benefit from any hardware acceleration and arithmetic on it will require relatively expensive multiplication division by powers of 10 which is far more expensive than multiplication and dividion by powers of 2 to match the exponent before addition subtraction and to bring the exponent back into range after multiplication division

typically operations like addition and subtraction are much faster in integer -- multiplication and division less so

division multiplication has higher precedence than addition subtraction and parentheses is required to do addition subtraction before multiplication division

i don t understand why the division multiplication in c++ is so much slower than addition subtraction where the managed c# version is more reasonable to my expectations

nothing follows the rule of multiplication and division having more precedence over addition and subtraction

the addition and subtraction are much more than multiplication and division

this is happening because the concatenation operator has a higher precedence than the addition or subtraction operators but multiplication and division have a higher precedence then concatenation

the term is apparently not an exact measurement as it is clear that a double-precision floating-point operation is going to take longer than a single-precision one and multiplication and division are going to take longer than addition and subtraction

the intuition would say addition subtraction are faster than multiplication division but is that really correct

in general you ll have more variation with multiplication and division than with addition and subtraction

integer multiplication division and modulo are much slower than integer addition and subtraction


freemarker	velocity---------------------------------------------------

little bit advanced
freemarker is more advanced but a little complex as compared to apache velocity

from my experience of both i would suggest that velocity is a little bit simpler but freemarker is more powerful


better best route
velocity or freemarker might be a better route in this case

also note that velocity is not the best option going forward freemarker would be a better way to go

chunk features includes branching looping and macros and has a simpler syntax than velocity and freemarker

i dont think velocity or freemarker will be faster than this

velocity is simpler than freemarker

velocity or freemarker might be a better option

although i agree that velocity or freemarker may be a better choice if you really need to render a jsp and capture the output as a string which you could pass to a javamailer check out my tutorial on capturing jsp output


easier engine templating
a templating system such as velocity or freemarker may make this easier

i suggest using a template engine such as freemarker for this or velocity but freemarker is better imo

probably you can take a look at rythm template engine which is much faster than freemarker and velocity also much easier to use

i d like to have the view tehnology be jsps i find them much easier than freemarker or velocity


it powerful
freemarker is more powerful than velocity

however i think velocity or freemarker are more powerful in terms of what you can do with it.


free	memcpy---------------------------------------------------

malloc memalloc faster
a realloc can occur significantly faster than a malloc memcpy and free

as you can see from the above tests realloc is consistently faster compared to memalloc memcpy and free


memcpy	strcpy---------------------------------------------------

performance difference time
performance difference memcpy is usually more efficient than strcpy which must scan the data it copies

memset behaves like strcpy but the difference is that memcpy copied the data as it is byte but strcpy copies the formatted string as well so takes more time than memcpy to execute


information source large
because of the above replace strdup with strlen malloc memcpy memcpy is slightly faster than strcpy

on almost any platform memcpy is going to be faster than strcpy when copying the same number of bytes

memcpy is rarely slower than strcpy or strncpy and often significantly faster

memcpy is usually faster than strcpy for longer strings

so i feel that on x86 memcpy is faster than strcpy

notice that memcpy is faster than strcpy unless the source string is much smaller than the buffer s size which is rarely the case with ip addesses.

your macro with memset and memcpy was not any safer than strcpy

but sometimes memcpy performs faster than strcpy because it moves blocks of memory at a time which allows it to perform some optimization i will not go into details here

memcpy can be faster than strcpy and strncpy because it does not have to compare each copied byte with 0 and because it already knows the length of the copied object

memcpy is not really any slower than strcpy

information - use memcpy as it s faster than strcpy and we know

for example for small amounts of data an memcpy optimised for large amounts of data may be significantly slower than a strcpy that wasn t optimised for large amounts of data

is memcpy usually faster than strcpy on most real platforms

we keep track of what cmd s length ought to be in a variable and copy the string with memcpy which is slightly faster than strcpy and does neither check string length nor copy the extra zero at end of string

memcpy is faster than strcpy and also enforces you to specify a buffer size

you could use memcpy memset for strings too but strcpy is simpler


ati	nvidia---------------------------------------------------

rendermonkey faster tools
ati might be a better between nvidia and ati since it was reportedly faster in 2009 but i m not sure if those stats are still correct

nvidia provide much better driver support in linux than ati do

the reason i ask is that it seems like nvidia has way better tools and ati seems to have cancelled rendermonkey


postgresql	greenplum---------------------------------------------------

onkeyup	onkeydown---------------------------------------------------

gridbaglayout	miglayout---------------------------------------------------

open-source expressive convenient
miglayout works similarly to gridbaglayout but is more powerful and more expressive

you can also check out the open-source miglayout which is much more convenient that gridbaglayout and also a bit more powerful


jobs	cron---------------------------------------------------

robust daemons sophisticated
i would suggest scheduling your jobs using something more sophisticated than cron

cron jobs are more robust than daemons


better grip wordpress
when you need to scale out cron jobs you are better off using a job manager like gearman

cron jobs works well with wordpress even if a server cron is better

please read trough it for a better grip over cron jobs in laravel

btw for cron at jobs is better to use absolute directory pathes not relative


queue nodes efficient
please you a job queue that is more efficient than cron jobs

if you ever need to scale up your cron jobs adding more nodes then you ll need a distributed queue lock solution as ken cochrane described


scheduler familiar job
i have taken on someones project that has automation using task scheduler while i am more familiar with cron jobs

if you can predict more than one cron job to be executed you can try or any other library like this where you can config jobs scheduler in php


google answer engine
google app engine does not allow us to schedule more than 20 cron jobs

google cron jobs to find more about it and here s an answer that could help you


intersect	contains---------------------------------------------------

codeigniter	cakephp---------------------------------------------------

frameworks libraries smaller
depending on how much you used cakephp you may need to realize that frameworks other than codeigniter often have more libraries and auto-generating funcionality is that the right word

if you employ php frameworks like codeigniter yii maybe even cakephp which have comparatively smaller learning curves you will find your path wellpaved for you in php


mvc great thing
why do people say cakephp is somewhat harder than codeigniter for people new to mvc

also i don t think it is so much that asp.net mvc is so much better than cakephp or codeigniter ruby on rails etc. the great thing about asp.net mvc and other asp.net-based technologies such as monorail is that developers who are using asp.net now have the option of following the mvc pattern using tools and languages they are familiar with


curve lower learning
yii has a higher learning curve than say codeigniter and cakephp

codeigniter has the lower learning curve overall so i would recommend it over cakephp


fread	read.table---------------------------------------------------

base read_csv standard
for reading large csv files you should either use readr read_csv or data.table fread as both are much faster than base read.table

for this data.table fread would be better than the standard read.table


data read.csv conventional
you might want to give the data.table package a try check out the fread function which is much faster than read.table

instead of the conventional read.table i feel fread is a faster function

fread performs faster and more efficiently than read.table but read.table produces less no errors on the same data set

fread ... is extremely fast 10 - 100 times faster than read.table ... or read.csv ... for large datasets


integer	fractions---------------------------------------------------

lower conversion data
than use bcpow on the integer part and bc_exp on the fractions part which now converges from the get-go since the fractions part is smaller than 1

the label s text size of an integer part is bigger than text size of a fractions part

when you then calculate the integer part is 1 less that you might expect while the fractions part is slightly less than one

if a decimal fractions is included lower order time elements if any shall be omitted and the decimal fractions shall be divided from the integer part by the decimal sign specified in iso 31-0 the comma or full stop .

if you divide a 15 digit number by 3 you lose one digit because the division may not make the integer part have fewer digits and it demands an extra digit for the fractions part

another example is geometry classes one parametrized to work with 64bit floats another parametrized to work with 64bit integers passing data between them may result both in rounding errors integer can t represent fractions and overflow integer has bigger value range than same-sized float

so my problem is how could i extract the fractions part from 254.73 so that i can get exact 73 as integer to do more calculations

if fractions part was greater than 0.5 adding 0.5 to it will increase the integer part and after conversion we get 1 higher of the original integer part rounding up

those approach that you are using trys to make a number integer if a fractions part is less than 1e-6 0.000001

that means that the 16 upper bits of a glfixed represents the integer part and the fractions is the lower 16 bits divided by 65536

so if the fractions part was less than 0.5 adding 0.5 will not increase the integer part and so after conversion the integer part will be the same rounding down


multiplication result exponents
the reason i used it is because integer math and multiplication are faster than fractions math and division

the result of the multiplication is slightly less than an integer because the numbers are internally stored in binary and you can t represent most fractions numbers exactly in binary for the same reason 1 3 can t be written exactly in decimal with a finite number of digits after the decimal point

fractions exponents are considerably more difficult since it means essentially calculating an nth-root of the base where and multiplying the result by the result of the integer portion power calculation


larger type format
if the number of bits in the mantissa or fractions is larger than the number of bits in your integer type then you ll possibly lose precision when someone types in a number such as

therefore ieee 754 single precision floating-point format has 23-bits fractions and int type has 32 bits so if the integer is larger than 2 24-1 the float type can t represent it exactly

i know there are not that many mantissa bits for fractions part for bigger numbers but you did not specify which floating data-type you are using if 32 64 80 128 256 bits or more so hard to say and if the integer part is bigger then your integral data-type used to cut off the non fractions part then you would be in trouble with f-long f

a floating-point format with a n-bit fractions can t represent the integer which is larger than 2 n+1 -1 because it will lose the precision


wav	flac---------------------------------------------------

comment better ogg
regearding your comment i also know that it can deal with flac better than wav and ogg that is not really the case

i also know that it can deal with flac better than wav and ogg


yacc	bison---------------------------------------------------

intuitive parser technology
a parser built from technology other than yacc bison might make it easier

however it is not easier than yacc bison

this is sometimes easier than yacc bison and usually more intuitive


squash	branch---------------------------------------------------

range	min---------------------------------------------------

data upper spread
if you want to check that a number is between the min and max of the range you would likely want to check that it is both higher than the min and lower than the max

and during sometime i have a range where min and max is less than 1 and greater than 0

i would like to know if there is a way to access the range of said shader properties so that i can set a max and min value to my sliders

issue here is i need to submit myform but because of min max attribute i get this tip value must be less than or equal to 20 or value must be greater than or equal to 10 for the inputs submitted lesser or greater than the range provided in min and max attributes respectively because of this my form does not get submitted

if you look how floating point numbers are implemented they can t represent all numbers between their max and min as the number of real numbers in a range is bigger than infinite

if min is bigger than max i just return a random character from the entire range

if range is greater then or less then the min and max then it should throw error

it looks like the default calulation of the range slider is min + max - min 2 or min if max is less than min

however i m getting a attributeerror max must be larger than min in range parameter. error when i m trying to plot the normalized data

produces the same error attributeerror max must be larger than min in range parameter

now you can see in the product.rb i want to fetch the product based on the price so that in the with_min_range the result will be the products whose variants minimum price range will be greater than the value of min

to return a random integer equal or greater than min smaller or equal to max with chance probability of the result to equal x and 100-chance probability spread uniformly among all other results in the given range

in general you want to have a range slightly larger than x max - x min and then divide the range into the desired number of bins

the question i have is i would like the calendar to only display the min and max date range for the from date and to date any thing greater than the max and anything less than the min should be greyed out

here is a dynamic solution that works for any range of numbers where min is less than max

range is 5000 to 50000 what i want to achive is in maxpoint select box i want to display the values which are greater than min points selected value

to create equal bins you can simply first define a min and max value which is slightly smaller than both range

for ease of debugging i pass the value of to reactive values and print the first date range s value to the console rendered to check whether the it is smaller or bigger than the min and max of the corresponding date column as i did in the lapply function

whenever the lower range is set higher than the upper range the upper range automatically changes value and min attribute to match the lower range value

main problem why i cant adopt those solution is that every of my random values has different range and i need the values to be uniformly distributed withing the range no frequency occurances at min max for example which happens if i cut off the values which are less greater than min max

a larger range means a greater max value and a smaller min value than decimal

figure the max values yourself and use integer range min to max to ensure no bigger than necessary usage

i m working on slider that updates 2 text boxes with values the slider is in a limited range so it doesn t give values lower higher than min max

the max value of a range must be greater than or equal to the min

take a look at your picture - all the range you want have ending time greater than min and starting time less than max

the whenever clause is required in this case to prevent min values being higher than the max values and to ensure that the range size does not exceed the capacity of an int

so just calculate how many bits you need range.bitlength may be useful check if randomized value is in specified range so if value is greater than range random again if everything is ok return randomized value increased by min

but continuing i always got attributeerror max must be larger than min in range parameter

the dis min max part sets a range of min and max values this distribution can come up with which means it will never generate a value bigger than max or smaller than min

ie the range includes min but excludes max and values greater than max or less than min wrap around in a circle

also consider that you are looking for the min date and if the partition function has range that include more than 1 date value then even if the optimizer narrowed down the specific partition rather quickly it would still need to scan the entire partition because you don t have an index defined on that date field

i want to make sure that the user does not enter a zero for the max value and also that the min value is less than the max value not equal to but less than - i need the range of values max - min

check the the min value of this range is lower than the ip

my solution to the range part feels clunky over complicated and doesn t check if the max range value is bigger than the min range value doesn t check if 10 2

grid min value should be either 0 or a nice value lower than the min value of the data in range

workaround is to use a value lower than the min value in range -2065 here or you can also use -1e9 to have a shorter string

to randomize output at resulting array select a number greater than min and less than n to create a random number within a specific range

age can be in the range of 0..100 but i want also to validate crossing values i mean that max is greather than or equal to min


dbcontext	objectcontext---------------------------------------------------

different understanding feature
there are many reasons why the dbcontext api is better than the older objectcontext api but in your case it may initially feel like a downgrade

dbcontext api is easier to work with than objectcontext but both approaches use the former

my understanding is that although dbcontext is newer it s not necessarily better than objectcontext it just provides a different api that might be considered simpler but doesn t that depend on the use case

dbcontext is newer api which should polish developers experience when using most common tasks - simply the api is better designed but you still have to get objectcontext from dbcontext and use the older api if you want to use some more complex features

it is a feature it is about objectcontext api but the same is true or worse with dbcontext api

from what i have read the dbcontext is a simplified version of the objectcontext and makes it easier to work with

dbcontext is a much more pleasant api than objectcontext

the problem with dbcontext api is even worse because dbcontext api doesn t offer methods to change state of independent association so you must revert back to objectcontext api and use objectstatemanager.changerelationshipstate

besides the dbcontext api is easier to use than objectcontext


common simpler development
and dbcontext is much simpler to use than objectcontext and will serve the most common development needs

dbcontext is much simpler to use than objectcontext and will serve the most common development needs


vbscript	vb6---------------------------------------------------

next	except---------------------------------------------------

first else ceiling
now i would like to take the ceiling of this number except in cases where the amount it is greater than the next lower integer is smaller than some epsilon

for such numbers as 54321 the else statement will be executed never because any next digit is greater than max1 except the first two digits


checks element multi
it compares every item except the last - it will be checked by the second last item and checks whether the next item is smaller

moving iterator from one element to the next is an o c operation both in the list and in the multi map except c is slightly smaller for the list so it is unlikely you ll gain much by combining the two


cobertura	jacoco---------------------------------------------------

answer better easier
you are better off with jacoco than cobertura

the other answer mentions cobertura but jacoco may be easier to set up

similarly you might find using jacoco easier than cobertura


nfa	dfa---------------------------------------------------

easier string disadvantages
because representation of a given problem with a nfa is far easier than the equivalent dfa

i know that dfa s are easier to implement than nfa s and that nfa s are slower to arrive at the accept state than dfa s but are there any other explicit well known advantages disadvantages

though forming the nfa maybe easier on paper checking a valid string against an nfa will be more complicated than verifying one against a dfa due to accounting for epsilon-jumps

stephen string search or a compiled dfa you can construct them from an nfa which is easier to make

nfa representations are more compact but dfa s are easier to simulate


faster powerful parser
generally speaking dfa is faster but nfa is more compact

regex is a nfa and is as such in most cases slower than a dfa or hand-written parser

perl uses nfa which is slower yet more powerful than the dfa engine sed has


thing states combinations
with a dfa you spend more time building it and allocating more states whereas with an nfa you spend more time executing it since it can be multiple states at the same time and backtracking can eat your lunch â and your cpu

if we express combinations of states in an nfa as states themselves we ve got a dfa with a lot more states than the nfa but which does the same thing

only thing is that nfa have more nodes than a dfa


centos	linux---------------------------------------------------

outputs verison sudo
some of linux distributions use older python version for root user like centos .have a look at the outputs of which python and sudo which python you ll see they might be different

some of linux distributions use older python version for root user like centos .if the python verison you re running with sudo isn t correct you can t access those modules installed by pip


atan2	sqrt---------------------------------------------------

mouseout	mouseleave---------------------------------------------------

text better
found a way to make sure the mouseleave mouseout works better

also see i ve replaced mouseout with mouseleave which should work better than mouseout text will not jump up and down

there can be times when mouseout is a better choice than mouseleave


method mouseover mouseup
in this case mouseenter mouseleave has better behaviour and prevents bubbling compared to mouseover mouseout

imho mouseenter and mouseleave are much more reliable than mouseover and mouseout which tend to flicker

this may make for various race conditions and may necessitate using events which give you earlier notification than mouseup mousedown mouseenter mouseleave mouseover mouseout

also instead of mouseover and mouseout use the better ones mouseenter and mouseleave or simply the .hover method

also you might want to use mouseenter and mouseleave which are sanitized by jquery and are a little more reliable than mouseover and mouseout

it should also be noted that mouseenter and mouseleave work somewhat differently and usually much better than mouseover and mouseout

because jquery doesn t use mouseover and mouseout it uses mouseenter and mouseleave which are more suited to this scenario

i have no idea about the classes but i think mouseenter and mouseleave are better alternative for mouseout and mouseover


querypath	phpquery---------------------------------------------------

eyes easier
it s easier with phpquery or querypath

or better yet use querypath or phpquery which are easier on the eyes

usually querypath or phpquery are also easier on the eyes


imperative	declarative---------------------------------------------------

comfortable approach step
there is a big discussing between object-oriented and procedural approaches and more generally between declarative and imperative ones and each approach has its upsides and downsides

as a coder sql is my weakest link since i am far more comfortable with imperative languages than declarative ones - but i want to change that

imperative is the traditional step by step recipe approach while declarative is more this is what i want now you work out how to do it


false understanding cleaner
are there any studies on whether functional declarative or imperative programming is easier to learn as a first language

i ve been teaching myself a bit about declarative vs imperative programming and i ve come to the possibly false understanding that declarative programming is more or less just abstraction

i know that declarative way is cleaner but sometimes imperative programming makes your business safer

declarative programming is not always simpler than imperative programming


jmeter	soapui---------------------------------------------------

jlist	jtable---------------------------------------------------

matter user display
it seems a jtable or jlist might be better than a bunch of buttons as well

probably using a jlist or a jtable is a better choice than display records using text fields

or for that matter a jlist or jtable might be better suited to displaying the user input

a jlist would probably be better than a jtable

i don t really think that jtable will help you here anyhow better than jlist - it has the same rendering strategy


openssl	gnutls---------------------------------------------------

screens	hdpi---------------------------------------------------

font high 72x72
if the screens density is less than xhdpi i load smaller sampled sizes of the 96x96 image - as 36x36 for ldpi 48x48 for mdpi 72x72 for hdpi

if you re diligent about making graphics for at least the main three densities ldpi mdpi and hdpi then you should not see over-large icons except where the screens is physically smaller than your layout expects it

try placing youre images in res mdpi they will be streched to fit screens which are bigger hdpi xhdpi

ldpi assets will look bad on high density screens but are exponentially smaller than mdpi which is exponentially smaller than hdpi etc

a hdpi image on a ldpi screens would appear larger than the same image on a mdpi or hdpi screens

a ldpi image on a hdpi screens would appear smaller than the same image on a mdpi or ldpi screens

it suppose to load images from the hdpi folder because it s screens density is smaller than 320 dpi

am i missing something here it suppose to load images from the hdpi folder because it s screens density is smaller than 320 dpi

because i have bigger font size for hdpi screens and it goes smaller with ldpi screens

if in java code the values would be in pixels so 50px on mdpi screens will look larger than on hdpi screens

proportionally the hdpi screens is slightly taller than the mdpi screens

so as i said - mdpi also doesn t means that your screens resolution is less than hdpi screens resolution

even if i create three versions for ldpi mdpi and hdpi there are more than screens resolutions in that table if there is no matching image it will scale my image and may not retain the aspect ratio


accelerometer	gyroscope---------------------------------------------------

results precision magnetometer
so after googling this i found that using gyroscope sensor is more accurate than the accelerometer

i was considering to at some point implement more interfaces to get the raw data from the android hardware sensors compass gyroscope and accelerometer to generate more accurate results but even if i do go ahead with this would this improve much

the precision of the gyroscope and accelerometer sensors is much greater than the precision of the compass and gps

also i have tried the accelerometer sensor and it worked but i m asking to check whether the gyroscope is more accurate to this function or the accelerometer

some of people says that i have to use not just accelerometer sensor use more sensors such as gyroscope or magnetometer


fgets	fgetc---------------------------------------------------

mousemove	mouseenter---------------------------------------------------

affinity	processors---------------------------------------------------

glibc	tcmalloc---------------------------------------------------

available faster malloc
tcmalloc is faster than the glibc 2.3 malloc.

tcmalloc is faster than the glibc 2.3 malloc available as a separate library called ptmalloc2 and other malloc s that i have tested


packets	multicast---------------------------------------------------

xmlhttprequest	jqxhr---------------------------------------------------

screens	tablet---------------------------------------------------

margins queries res
having different ones based upon screens size is reasonable bigger margins on tablet though the mix then would be something like res values dimens.xml and res values-sw720dp values.xml

basically my layout has 1200px grid width but i figured that there will be a problem with 1024px screens resolution 20 of the population bla bla so i created media queries when the screens size is smaller than 1199px the grid to change its width to 960px and so on for tablet phones etc..


different data sizes
desktops when in full screens have a more detailed data entry experience whereas mobile tablet have a different experience because of device real estate is smaller

you do not have to provide different layouts for different screens sizes however the possibility of say a tablet displaying more data over a phone is there - so you may want to give the user more options or show the navigation constantly

in the long run you ll have less troubles with supporting tablet multiple screens sizes and you can easily re-use them in different contexts


smaller width smartphone
in mobile platforms except larger screens as on tablet the affix would be disabled entirely and the page would only rely on the responsiveness of the grid

inside the container i have a panel with the text set to left but when the screens gets smaller then a tablet to something like a phone i want the text in the panel to center

but when i tested my game on tablet it fit perfectly in height but in case of width game view width was shorter than the tablet screens width

my aim is to use a bootstrap 3 dropdown to display links at mobile screens size and use a list to display the same links when the screens is bigger desktop and tablet size

what i would like to do is use css media queries to have the title be above the tabs when the screens gets smaller or on a tablet or iphone

since the screens of an ipad or other tablet is bigger than a phone s display and that would leave me with a bunch of open space i was wondering if there is something in codename one to have an image pop-up on a tablet but that it is not visible on a phone s display

you could make your css mobile-first meaning that all properties are optimized for mobile then as the screens gets wider you apply tablet and desktop optimized css for elements

the reason those two really high resolutions exist in mdpi is because they are only used on tablet which have a larger screens size...so the dpi rating works out to still be in the midrange

another layout for larger devices like tablet where the screens width is larger than your image

youll want to choose which screens dimensions you consider as mobile might be hard as some tablet are barely bigger than some smartphone.

in portrait mode your phone screens is smaller than that so screen_is_narrow is true whereas in landscape mode and on tablet it is wider and thus screen_is_narrow becomes false

fragment primary support more dynamic large ui screens like tablet.because tablet screens is much larger than normal handset

it s hard to explain but just imagine that i move this layout to 300px x then on the phone it works because the screens isn t that large but on tablet it will probably not work because the screens is larger

on a tablet or phone which may have less than 750px screens width it will go off the viewport

i have some buttons i want to order in a table layout and everything is working fine but of course a tablet screens is much bigger than a normal smartphone screens

this will only be added if the screens width is smaller than 480px else the tablet version would show the mobile version

when viewed on a screens wider than a tablet to be responsive according to the smaller screens size like this

owing to the fact that the screens density on the tablet is smaller android therefore uses the images in the mdpi folder for the tablet and the slightly bigger ones in the hdpi folder for the phone

twitter desktop accomodates screensizes from around 1048px wide when you are on a screens that is smaller then that you are probably on a tablet or smartphone and if you open twitter from a browser on your phone you are instantly redirected to and prompted to download the twitter app

the first time i run this on a device i realized that i was on a wrong track for some of the local phablets tablet mobile that have large screens has less screens density

that hopefully explains why a typical 320dp phone screens is always smaller than a 720dp tablet screens although the smaller screens can have more pixel than the larger

for example when the screens size becomes smaller to a tablet or mobile you could do this as an example

the desktop tablet version is working fine its when the screens gets smaller and the smartphone version loads the image doesn t work as it should

like most screens being no smaller than 320px width most mobile sizes in the 320â 640px range tablet usually around 960px

it is quite possible that those large devices tablet have much larger screens width and height than a typical phone

however the number of people using these giant tablet is much smaller than the number of people with small screens laptops

this way you get if the screens height or width is greater than 960px and the dpi is low probably you re on a tablet

the image i have on my home screens and tablet display resize smaller to see tablet display are both set to background-size contain

i have been working on this page that works fine in desktop devices and tablet but not on phones because the width of the page is more than the screens width i need to make this width responsive to have the page with height-only scroll

if i try to distinguish based on resolutions it wouldn t work right since some high end smartphones have smaller screens but higher screens resolutions while some tablet have bigger screens but smaller resolutions

also a tablet might be more suited since it runs apps in tablet layout mode versus a phone layout with everything being too large on a bigger screens

if the app is running on a tablet or in a landscape view where the screens is larger than certain width i d like the listviews to have the data-inset property set to true and be rendered with rounded corners and borders

to ensure all tablet excluding any larger screens phone will use the new layout how should i name my layout folder

an xlarge screens is defined as a screens that is significantly larger than a large screens such as a tablet or something larger and may require special care on the application s part to make good use of it though it may rely on resizing by the system to fill the screens

to determine device is tablet or mobile i use criteria if device s screens diagonal is greater than 7 iches the device is tablet


size phones devices
i would like to make my app available only on phones i.e devices whose screens sizes are less than 5.5 inch.how do i limit my app from being visible on tablet on play store

take into account dpi is not related to screens size on the other side larger screens tablet have lower dpi than most modern phones

i ve come across this website and when you scale the page down to tablet size the logo which is ethan marcotte is in perfect ratio when the screens size gets bigger and smaller

based on my understanding i hope that is because the size of the tablet screens which is smaller than the desktop that makes the strokes to get hidden inside the area that was not visible on the tablet however the area is visible in desktop

this only happens when the window is on a computer in full screens mode but when the screens is made smaller to a phone tablet size the divs function how they should

i can t use screens size because of devices like galaxy note with huge screens and some phones have higher resolution than some tablet same with dpi i think

in my actual code i ve set the display to none if the screens width is larger than tablet size because that s the only time i feel like i need the button

splitactionbar works only on phones because the screens size is much smaller than tablet and it takes space at the bottom for extra space for your action items

just be aware that screens size categories like xlarge for example aren t tied to a hard number like 10 inches. instead official documentation uses terms like an xlarge screens is defined as a screens that is significantly larger than a large screens such as a tablet or something larger ...


larger handset smaller
i beleive tablet have greater screens resolutions than smartphones

however i also need to support tablet which have wider screens

the screens is much smaller so you can not present your app the same way as you can on a tablet

not all tablet will have a larger screens after all

because a tablet s screens is much larger than that of a handset there s more room to combine and interchange ui components

correct me if im wrong but i think the apk for mobile can be used to install the app in tablet.your problem would be in the ui coz mobile has smaller screens than tablet

the tablet s screens must be larger than the phone s screens

on tablet the screens size is much bigger and there is enough space for most of the action items that s why your menu is placed on top

because a tablet s screens is much larger than that of a


room available space
you will also notice that the fonts are not scaling as the 7 tablet simply has more screens space available vs the 4 phone

if my app runs on tablet i put more fragments on the screens as there s room for this and i got just one activity in which i replace fragments when needed

it simply comes down to the space available a tablet gives more room to developers thus allowing developers to put more on one screens


higher pixels resolution
a bitmap of a screenshot can get really big on a tablet since the screens resolution is likely higher

which means a big tablet screens gets the lower dimen values and images and everything looks extra small

screens resolution i.e higher than tablet i.e col-md and col-lg in bootstrap language should only cover 11 grid with offset of 1

this is because that tablet often has a lower density of screens pixels

my all menu with the brand should stay in one line in all tablet screens and the screens having higher resolution than it

incidentally many smartphones and tablet do have higher dpi screens

i know that obviously a tablet has a higher screens resolution than a phone because it has more pixels dots on the screens from what ive been reading tablet also have a higher dpi dots per inch than phones as well

the tablet had a higher resolution 1920 x 1080 pixels - found by checking the screens resolution through a right click on the desktop than the machine i had initially run the program on 1366 x 768 pixels


bigger layout 240dpi
768px which applies for everything bigger such as large tablet screens and desktops screens

this tablet has a bigger screens yet is still showing only 2 child views in the row

my development environment uses dual-17 monitors which are far bigger than the tablet screens size of 10.4 1024x768

i m trying use a grid layout but my problem is the layout showing bigger than my screens on the 240dpi tablet 1 5 times bigger

suppose you were to choose a new tablet and you wanted it to have 1 a big screens and 2 a screens that is bigger than 20cm

on a tablet i don t have this issue because the screens size is bigger and i make videoview always on screens

so how i create my layout bigger than tablet screens using xml and just do something that will hide show the listview 1 or listview 2 to work using any tablet

if the screens is bigger than 1024px it should be green my tablet screens is but the background stays yellow

in practice this would be a tablet sized screens bigger than 320px wide when it is in portrait

but tablet program screens will be bigger right

unsigned	short---------------------------------------------------

data standard integer
you re telling it to read a value into unsigned int variable but you re giving a pointer to an unsigned short which is smaller so it overwrites whatever is after n in the stack frame causing undefined behavior -- in your case corrupting fact

or would it be good practice to use an unsigned chars in this case since it allocates less memory than a short int

about 99.9 percent of the data in question is much less than the unsigned short int size but use unsigned int to be safe

on your system unsigned int is apparently larger than uint16_t int is a greater ranked integer type than short in the standard 6.3.1.1 even if they are of the same size

if size_type is defined as unsigned short and int is wider than unsigned short the lhs of your addition will be converted to the rhs and you rely on the addition being performed in the lhs s type

if int is wider than short which is common but not guaranteed then an argument of type unsigned short when passed to a variadic function like swprintf will be prompted to int

so in the second expression high-order bits are removed by the cast to unsigned short while in the first expression they won t be removed if int is wider than short

this is pretty simple for types sizeof int but unsigned chars short is more complicated and requires compiler specific packing

when integral types like chars short int bool take less number of bytes than int then these data types are automatically promoted to int or unsigned int when an operation is performed on them

a number bigger than 64bit can never occur in a multiplication because c is an unsigned integer of 32 bits and k is a unsigned short of 16-bit

the only constraints were that int s must be no smaller than short s and long s must be no smaller than int s and size_t must represent the largest unsigned type supported by an implementation

the rule for performing arithmetic operations in c c++ is that if the type such as short is narrower than int then it gets widened to int if all values can fit or unsigned int otherwise

that does leave one loophole though it s one that would generally be quite horrible that chars and short have the same range size_type is the same as unsigned short and int has a greater range than chars short

if you convert signed short to signed int and int is wider than short the compiler would generate code that does the conversion and that conversion is different from unsigned short to signed int sign extension or not

on the other hand if size_t were something like unsigned short and int bigger than short then int could represent all possible size_t values and s would be converted to int

btw on some processors unsigned short is much slower than unsigned int because the c standard requires that operations on unsigned types wrap


rank synonym higher
once you provide a unsigned short it can be promoted to int but unsigned long being in higher rank than int cannot be promoted to int hence you end up supplying wrong type of argument to d which will invoke undefined behavior

it will get promoted to type int because type int can represent all values of type size_t and rank of size_t being a synonym for unsigned short is lower than the rank of int

nevertheless unsigned short has lower rank than int by definition and is subject to integral promotion


numbers char method
i used a short int to represent the numbers from -32000 to 32000 also i used unsigned to get bigger numbers

so if you tell it to expect an unsigned short for example then it will actually expect either an int if int is wider than unsigned short or unsigned int if int and short are the same size

an unsigned char is an unsigned value which is typically smaller than and is guaranteed not to be bigger than a short

given your output the short and unsigned short are smaller than int

alignment may fail as unsigned short can be narrower than unsigned int

that s not so much the case any more now that we have multiple types larger than int but back when c was young the int types were chars short int and unsigned versions of those so all the other types were promoted to int and all code to manipulate anything was done with int s

but in case short is a smaller type than int it is always converted to signed int regardless of it the short was signed or unsigned

i have a method that returns a but i want to allow for more numbers than an unsigned short can hold so i would like to convert it to a before i add my bigger numbers to it

if short is the same size as int unsigned short is larger than int

how often does redis handle strings longer than unsigned short int

as unsigned short int is in some implementations smaller than unsigned int

additionally there may be padding bits in an unsigned short that cause your program to misbehave or an unsigned short might be smaller or larger than 2 bytes depending on char_bit and the choices of the implementation

if short is smaller than int on the given platform as is the case on 32 and 64 bit systems any short or unsigned short will therefore always get converted to int because they can fit inside one

an unsigned short int has lower rank than int the values are promoted when used as operands to +

therefore the size of a short or unsigned short may be larger than what i just posted above

values of integral types narrower than int chars signed chars unsigned chars short int and unsigned short is promoted to int

it s not an unsigned int any more than unsigned short or unsigned long are it s a distinct type albeit one that can be promotoed quite readily to other types

smaller than int unsigned short becomes int

integral promotion involves the conversion of int types narrower than int which includes bool chars unsigned chars signed chars unsigned short signed short to an int if possible or an unsigned int


hex	binary---------------------------------------------------

data readable dump
hex is somewhat more readable than binary if i happen to be loading a data dump in a text editor etc

binary data is typically represented in hex to make it easier to read and reference

and because hex is much more readable and useful than binary - it s often used and shown

my program reads from binary data and i am just displaying it in hex to make it simpler


editors data paint.net
i ve been using images to store data since editing binary data through paint.net is much friendlier than most hex editors

hex editors are more of a tool for geeks as they also give you the computer data in hex a more readable format compared to binary


better substitute display
well we typically don t do too well reading binary and hex is a better substitute for that

originally i was looking for a binary display but this hex display is much better for viewing


decimal conversion octal
hex is just less verbose and can express anything a binary number can

as others have pointed out hex is much more convenient than binary anyway - you just need to remember how each of the hex digit 0-f looks in binary and replace groups of 4 bits with a single hex digit

it seems the from a readability and usability standpoint the hex representation is a better way of defining binary numbers

you ll see converting from binary to hex is much more straightforward than from decimal to hex for instance

one important reason is because hex is alot shorter and easier to read than binary is for humans

that s one reason why going from hex to binary is much easier than from decimal to binary

i have made it so that the binary properly converts to base ten decimal and the decimal properly converts to hex but it only works if the binary number is less than 5 digits 01101 correctly turns out 16 and 11111 turns 1f but something like 11010110 stupidly becomes 6 here s my code

but when anyone human looks at it they look at it in hex using a hex editor which is much easier than reading binary

with a little practice hex or octal are easier for a human than binary

generally hex values are preferred over decimal values as the conversion to binary from hex involves less computation than the conversion from decimal

converting between decimal and hex is more involving and at least to me it s been easier if i have to do it in my head to first convert the decimal into binary representation and then the binary number into hex

this is still accepted by calls like inet_addr and has several advantages all fields are fixed width there are only 8 characters to update and the binary to hex conversion is usually faster than binary to decimal

hex and octal are just shorter ways to write binary

so i m wondering if anyone knows of a way i could implement either a floating-point to binary digits function or better yet floating-point to hex

the conversion between binary and either octal or hex is even easier than decimal

the conversion from hex to binary is even simpler since you can simply expand each hex digit into the corresponding binary for example 0xa4 - 1010 0100


results template raw
the results of running a binary template are much easier to understand and edit than using just the raw hex bytes

- i usually find debugging memory in hex x command is easier than binary so i will not use my solution


couchbase	couchdb---------------------------------------------------

grafana	kibana---------------------------------------------------

public	protected---------------------------------------------------

private better restrictive
since package protected is less accessible than public the code is reducing the accessibility of the foo method

change it to public to make it more accessible or perhaps better protected to make it less accessible than public but more than private read more about that here

using default no protected private public is even worse as it allows classes in the same package or subclasses to access the logger

also using private and protected instead of public is more about good programming design than security and i recommend you read about it as well as polymorphism and inheritance

protected is closer to public than private

that prohibits you from doing something like having a protected and public overload where the protected overload is the better match

if you overload it you must also define it as protected or define it as public which is weaker

furthermore protected is actually closer to public than to private

for public inheritance it means that all the accessible members of base class that is the public and protected members can not be at a level more permissive than public

this access is more restricted than public and protected but less restricted than private

documentation provides more information than private protected public does and a good system will have documentation anyway

if you don t need it to be public it s often safer not to due to getter setter allowing better control over what values can be assigned then you should declare if protected or private

so a protected is more restrictive than public and private is more restrictive than protected

otherwise there is still the possibility to change a public access to a protected or package private access which will be much more restrictive than public

doesn t work either due to the public scope being less restrictive than the overall property scope of protected and moreover not of the same scoping level as defined on the base class s abstract property declaration

that means private is better than protected protected is better than public etc ..

secondly if you want the superclass variables to be accessible by your subclassing it s better to use protected than public

for your first problem make sure that both the classes are in the same package and the members are declared either public not recommended or protected better or don t specify any access specifier which is a bit more restrictive than protected

protected is more restrictive than public

it s not perfect but i guess that a protected method that does not check parameters is better than a public method that does not do it


constructor sense change
the theory is that someone extending your class with protected access knows more about what they are doing than someone who is merely using it with public access

there ll be no functional difference between the constructor being public or being protected but making it protected gives a clearer indication of the intended use

therefore the only types that should have access to a constructor are its derived types and hence protected makes much more sense than public

i did not make any changes more than change protected to public but i add another class in a new package to print the rules by these following codes

many developers have established a coding convention instead and used public for those cases where protected may have made more sense

with subclassing is trickier because any private members of a class are not inherited by the subclassing but protected and public are

oh i see you need a constructor that has more access than protected but less than public


easier aware methods
be aware that guaranteeing immutability by having no public or protected constructors is easier to break than making the class final

if the only purpose is improved testability then exposing methods as protected or public is an easier option


strlen	strcpy---------------------------------------------------

identical faster string.h
because of the above replace strdup with strlen malloc memcpy memcpy is slightly faster than strcpy

a normal addition would be to include string.h and use strlen and strcpy or memcpy instead of a loop to find your length or copy characters to plural note for long strings memcpy will be more efficient but for 10 char -- it makes no difference let me know if you have any questions

additionally if you have strdup then it is much more convenient than strlen + malloc + strcpy with identical result including the same obligation to free the allocated storage when you no longer need it


lisp	smalltalk---------------------------------------------------

alarmmanager	timertask---------------------------------------------------

uilabel	uitextview---------------------------------------------------

height better results
instead of using uilabel using uitextview gets better results

try to use uitextview rather than uilabel could be better cause uitextview use a contentview that maybe won t be resized immediatly

textcontainer s height need to be set depending on the content height for it to work and that is no better than using uitextview or uilabel


properties easier objects
or even easier rather than adding uilabel objects to a uiscrollview you could just use a uitextview

it isn t clear what you mean when you say the problem seems to be with the difference between a .text and string. ui objects like uitextfields uitextview and uilabel have text properties .text in swift syntax that hold the current value in the field


mergesort	in-place---------------------------------------------------

standard time memory
another reason is that mergesort needs more memory because it s hard to implement it as an in-place sort

1 in-place merge sort is used when you want to sort a list in o nlogn time while using less space than standard mergesort


zoo	xts---------------------------------------------------

starting data better
xts extends this further but zoo is a better starting point

imho xts or zoo would be a better data structure if you actually have time series data


uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller---------------------------------------------------

uiviewcontroller read-only actual
basically if the user is on a view under the more tab the actual current uinavigationcontroller you want to use to push a uiviewcontroller onto is the uitabbarcontroller s morenavigationcontroller property

there is only a read-only property of the uitabbarcontroller called morenavigationcontroller that points to a uinavigationcontroller


nexus	artifactory---------------------------------------------------

filesystem fair full
nexus looks better choice than artifactory because of using filesystem instead of database to keep repository

if they are going to use any non-maven way to retrieve them ui rest scripts ant gradle then you can go with any path and name you like and you ll get full support from artifactory uploading searching etc. with nexus which is much more maven-centric you ll better stick to maven notation

i will not argue why and if nexus is better than artifactory as it would not be fair and would only cause flame wars


bluestacks	android-emulator---------------------------------------------------

orika	dozer---------------------------------------------------

great jmapper reflection
i tested orika and it was a lot faster but was slower than dozer with small collections

i know that orika and jmapper are great libraries from google and they use reflection in a different way than for example dozer which is much slower they se reflection to generete code somehow

orika is way faster than dozer and quite close to manual mapping


slideup	slidedown---------------------------------------------------

google-chrome	safari---------------------------------------------------

harder wrong headers
dus anyone knows if there is something wrong with my json or if google-chrome is harder to get than safari

headers copied from google-chrome only since safari is harder to copy paste from


slower faster pc
it is only slow with google-chrome browser safari is much faster

in fact given that google rejected pointer event on the ground of speed which ie solved by gpu acceleration it can be said that google-chrome and webkit in general - safari is even slower is lagging behind on this front and the only way to help is contributing code to chromium webkit

in safari 10.0.3 cloneelement is 31 slower for the jsperf test mentioned above in google-chrome createelement is 17 slower for me

it seems to work fine in google-chrome but in safari it causes some hover issues on links

if i try to do a google search for website loading slower in google-chrome than in safari i get a lot of results about how safari is slower than google-chrome

firefox safari google-chrome and opera make up more than 30 of the market and they support many html5 standards

the one used by google-chrome and is slower than mobile safari s nitro javascript engine

google-chrome has more of the market than safari not and invitation for flame wars just a personal opinion without any weight -

when i try the demo in google-chrome or safari it is indeed much faster but when i ve tested it in firefox it s consistently slower

conclusion diff1 is faster in firefox opera and safari diff2 is faster in ie and google-chrome

this makes firefox 50x faster than google-chrome and 70x faster than safari is there any known reason for that

in ie java-script load slower than firefox safari and google-chrome

google-chrome or safari on a mac could be much faster than firefox on a pc especially with newer apis

in my opinion you re already testing far over the top - ie firefox google-chrome safari already corner more than 99 of the market in pc mac form

the browser does not matter though safari gets way more consistently working results than google-chrome

it takes longer than google-chrome or safari to load but it does load successfully

firefox google-chrome safari all have prioritized faster javascript execution in recent versions whereas ie may show performance in ie9 i hope they do myself. also realize this slideshow will run slow in mobile devices etc

notably google-chrome and safari performed much faster for the javascript test but i don t include those here because those tests were recorded in a different environment

i think it s simply because google-chrome firefox safari etc. are faster browsers

fast clicking on ie has slower response than firefox google-chrome and safari

pc google-chrome and safari are fine ie shows the links like in the picture firefox shows more revealed urls

my ipad 1 safari js benchmarked 38 times slower than google-chrome on my pc

please especially test on safari because it has some more problems than firefox and google-chrome

because of how google-chrome s plugin system works development mode in google-chrome is much slower than in firefox or safari see here for more details


smaller bigger blue
safari makes child block s height larger than google-chrome

the height of the blue bar in safari and google-chrome matches but in firefox it is smaller

the safari controller bar is the quicktime bar which is smaller and dark so the movement is less noticeable than google-chrome which has a big blue progress bar

safari 5.1.10 6534.59.10 middle handles a smaller viewport but in sort order with a smaller viewport computes new image sizes even smaller than google-chrome

in safari the background of my menu navigation drop-down menu s is much wider than in google-chrome firefox

this is because in ie and firefox the footer link text is larger than in google-chrome and safari therefore the margins that i ve set up for the icons do not work

safari will display fonts without a specified size significantly smaller than in google-chrome

the html tables on my site look nice and the way i intend them to in safari firefox google-chrome but look far wider than the set pixel size in ie

solved the problem came from css specificity.bootstrap s css was judged more specific by google-chrome regarding my menu s selector but not by firefox and safari

that i gave to every link in the set of links home about us products contact and it seems that firefox is making that 1px margin much bigger than safari or google-chrome and distorting it

according to some - browser - statistics ie6 market share is still bigger than google-chrome safari and opera together nearly as much as ie7


values cells
it appears that google-chrome can handle more values at the moment but safari can t

this happens in firefox and also in google-chrome cells shrink less in google-chrome but not in safari


better browsers version
i guess firefox and safari handle huge numbers of elements better than google-chrome

the console for safari and google-chrome imo is better

webkit browsers google-chrome safari android stocked browser google-chrome for android ios safari with -webkit- prefix

when the color of text is dark in safari and google-chrome i have better result with the text-stroke css property

browsers devices desktop browsers ie8+ google-chrome firefox safari ipad s browser mobile safari mobile devices browsers android mobile safari

on all of the other browsers i ve tried safari opera ie google-chrome it looks much less nice because all of those browsers scroll half a screen at a time

i am using franklin gothic font for website and font looks good on google-chrome and safari but on internet explorer and mozilla firefox it looks darker

fwiw i was able to solve my problem with greensock using tweenmax to animate individual paths inside and this worked in firefox gecko and webkit browsers safari google-chrome it does a better job of calculating the origin not exactly sure how but it worked for me

basically the way google-chrome renders text looks ugly and i want it to look like or almost like firefox or safari which looks thinner and better

why would the mobile google-chrome browser be so less performant than ios safari browser and very similiar hardware

it also gets broken even more in ios google-chrome which is an older version of safari

google-chrome also uses an earlier version of webkit than the current safari so pages should be checked in both browsers

therefore code should be written and tested around firefox google-chrome safari which are much closer to proper standards support than ie8 then conditional tags should be used in ie to work around its bugs

after that ie slows down at exponential rate when firefox google-chrome and safari are doing much better

font looks sharp in google-chrome safari ie8 not as good as other 2 but less fuzzy than firefox

if you are trying to support all users on all browsers then you will certainly need to do testing on those browsers although actively developing on those browsers may not be necessary whereas if you only need to support webkit-based browsers google-chrome safari or webkit-based browsers and firefox that is less testing that you need to do

in fact one could theorize your approach of having it show up after the finger is released is better than what google-chrome and safari is doing

since the fixed position in general is not all that stable on touch some more than others google-chrome works great it is still acting up in safari ios 8 in situations that used to work in ios 7 therefore i generally just use js to detect touch devices including windows mobile

it s not even a webkit issue unless google-chrome s got a newer version than safari

firefox recognizes this attribute but webkit google-chrome safari etc don t more info on caniuse.com

usually you want to avoid solutions from browser-vendor as they ll cater toward that specific browser but opera webkit google-chrome safari firefox devs are usually more knowledgeable in terms of cross-browser solutions and compliance with the standards than m ones

it seems that google-chrome internet explorer or safari are more strict than firefox on terms of security

in ie and firefox fullscreen_block appears closer to the bottom than in safari and google-chrome

firefox google-chrome opera and safari all handle it better

safari and google-chrome are even worse as they capitalize the s and the first letter of the css generated content 3 day s 5 hour s etc...

fireofx google-chrome safari and opera has better css selectors support compare to ie

it s way faster on ie but other major browsers firefox google-chrome safari and opera perform better when using a container and then appending it fragment or div

now i recognized that safari make more problems then the other browsers like google-chrome or firefox

okay safari ios is more strict than google-chrome android when it comes to this all fine but it still needs to enable me to allow the connection through

whether you use a plugin or write your own code css only is a no go for google-chrome safari and as you said firefox is better at dealing with it

safari still uses the older version while google-chrome uses a more current one

well unless you re targeting older than google-chrome 1.0 firefox 8.0 ie 4.0 opera 7.0 or safari 4.0 it s safe to use insertadjacenthtml

if you use the share button on the xcode documentation window to open the page in a web browser i had much better luck with safari than google-chrome 31 you can click on the mac ios developer library link in the top left corner of the webpage

google-chrome is worse than safari

edit what particularly interrests me is if desktop safari is closer to ios safari than google-chrome is

secondly the browsers above ie7 and other browsers like firefox google-chrome and safari have a better rendering engine and intuitively handle buggy markup

i checked many sites and there were people complaining about it with no response or people talking that safari and google-chrome have better fps

according to w3counter ie6 is used by more people than opera safari and any version of google-chrome

all the webkit-based browsers safari google-chrome and opera should be closer in their rendering to each other than firefox or ie 9 separately

webkit browsers such as google-chrome or safari are much more up to speed in that regard

safari comes in at just under 41ms performing better than google-chrome but still not great

i think safari renders the moves better than google-chrome

in safari and google-chrome it is better but still has visible juddering

all my other browsers safari google-chrome and opera have newer javascript versions

also i find that web inspector in safari google-chrome is better

it works great in google-chrome and safari haven t tested ie but i m sure it s somehow worse than firefox

it defaults to safari on my machine but i d like it to use google-chrome as the development tools in google-chrome are better

latest google-chrome safari are even worse they hide both boxes behind the iframe

it worked perfectly with google-chrome but safari 5 and firefox implement a more recent version of the websocket protocol and cramp does not so i couldn t get it to work there

i found out that with any opacity not text color alpha less than 1.0 google-chrome gave me good results but safari was still bad.

here ajax form breaks after adding html5 attributes in google-chrome safari is a better description and workaround


api wtf realtime
this seems to me like a bandwidth error or something like that originally i ve got the error when i played with the html 5 audio api and if i loaded the audio file 10-15 times sequentially then i ve got the error but now i ve discovered that i get the error without the audio api too just by reloading the site a lots of times also safari gives me the error much faster than google-chrome wtf

google-chrome also is susceptible to this same issue although it does a significantly better job than safari at getting the realtime api re-connected


width larger button
images on google-chrome are much larger using the exact size of the image itself while safari respects width 140 height 140 settings

total width of button in safari web inspector 6px larger than in google-chrome web inspector


thinner thicker lines
in its basic form the three lines are way thinner than within safari or google-chrome

if i add font-weight bold they get a little bit thicker but still thinner than within safari google-chrome

in safari it renders significantly brighter than in firefox or google-chrome


lower higher pixels
in safari it is several pixels higher up than in firefox and google-chrome and significantly lower in opera

now this works fine in google-chrome and safari and i have had to use assitional css settings for firefox but ie and opera both display my ribbon div about 25px higher than in google-chrome or safari

in firefox it seems that this is 1px lower than in google-chrome and safari


page cache unusable
safari is more funny than google-chrome i can easily make google-chrome cache my page but safari does not

ie is less performant than safari google-chrome and firefox when it comes to js - but have you really developed a page that is unusable in ie with js turned on


xsl-fo	xslt---------------------------------------------------

trie	dawg---------------------------------------------------

space efficiency waste
use a dawg which is more efficient than a trie in terms of space waste

it combines efficiency of a trie trie can be seen as a special case of dawg but is much more space efficient


data word acyclic
i would suggest that given your desire to also search through the stored string values you should consider whether either a trie structure such as a patricia trie or for even better memory amortisation a directed acyclic word graph refered to affctionalty as a dawg would work better

if you re interested there is another data structure called a dawg directed acyclic word graph that is similar to the trie but uses substantially less memory


qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene---------------------------------------------------

necessary window scroll
by default when you scale a qgraphicsscene larger than the qgraphicsview in which it is displayed it will show the necessary scroll bars

if i set a pixmap to a qgraphicsscene that is larger that the window it will add scrollbars so is it possible to get what is displayed in the qgraphicsview


fink	macports---------------------------------------------------

stable top access
because fink is reputedly more stable than macports and has many more packages

on top of that fink gives you access to more packages than macports

fink has more packages than macports


mouseover	mouseout---------------------------------------------------

mousedown mouseleave use
also you might want to use mouseenter and mouseleave which are sanitized by jquery and are a little more reliable than mouseover and mouseout

this may make for various race conditions and may necessitate using events which give you earlier notification than mouseup mousedown mouseenter mouseleave mouseover mouseout

imho mouseenter and mouseleave are much more reliable than mouseover and mouseout which tend to flicker

because jquery doesn t use mouseover and mouseout it uses mouseenter and mouseleave which are more suited to this scenario


function ones better
it should also be noted that mouseenter and mouseleave work somewhat differently and usually much better than mouseover and mouseout

i have no idea about the classes but i think mouseenter and mouseleave are better alternative for mouseout and mouseover

in this case mouseenter mouseleave has better behaviour and prevents bubbling compared to mouseover mouseout

also instead of mouseover and mouseout use the better ones mouseenter and mouseleave or simply the .hover method

what you have described in your question makes the use of this function better than mouseover and mouseout


octal	decimal---------------------------------------------------

convenient hexadecimal bit
octal or decimal are easier to use and maintain for bit masking imo

bitshifts just go easier with hexadecimal than decimal and is often more convenient to read than octal


base constants clearer
the conversion between binary and either octal or hex is even easier than decimal

hex or maybe octal depending on the machine being emulated will be clearer than using decimal since similar opcodes tend to vary in bits not digits

you ll need to convert binary to another base here i use decimal when writing this code because c doesn t have binary constants which would be ten times more useful than octal constants


setinterval	settimeout---------------------------------------------------

easier importantly ugly
you may want to consider using jquery timers instead which abstracts away many of the ugly details of settimeout setinterval and makes them easier to use in your code for things like what you are describing

you can use setinterval instead but for most animations settimeout is easier to control and more importantly.


sync choices sounds
in cases like this however where monitor sync is not that critical setinterval and settimeout are probably better choices in regard to load

it works super well initially but over the course of about a minute the sounds become noticeably out of sync as i ve read happens with setinterval i ve read that settimeout can be more consistently accurate


efficient frame rate
you made the right choice using setinterval instead of settimeout here as in this case settimeout would have been less efficient with memory resources

this allows for perfect synchronization with the monitor update rate as well as being more efficient than settimeout setinterval you could throttle it so you only update per 1 30 frame to match video rate by using a simple boolean flag that alternates


appropriate tasks look
i ve replaced settimeout with setinterval which is more appropriate for repeated tasks

also i advise you to take a look at javascript s setinterval since it is more appropriate than settimeout for what you want to do


animations better array
instead initiate all the settimeout s you need for the entire animation at the same time with increasing delays in a loop and let them run their course or better yet use setinterval which is the better way of doing animations and how for instance jquery s animations work

if so then you can just pop lines off the array using settimeout which is better than setinterval for most animations


better approach job
setinterval or settimeout are the better way to do this but you can also use jquery delay

but settimeout would be better than setinterval because with setinterval if your previous ajax request is not complete and you start another request there will have multiple requests which would sooner be problematic

that s better than setinterval or settimeout

btw when you use settimeout or setinterval it is better to pass it an actual function instead of a string with the source code for a function

in any case raf will enable the drawing to be synced to the monitor so in any case it will be a better choice than setinterval settimeout in cases such as these

should i use settimeout or setinterval which is better

we could still do this with settimeout but setinterval is better suited for this job

i think using settimeout is safer than setinterval

instead of using a for-loop and settimeout would setinterval work better for what you need

also settimeout is a better approach than setinterval as you explicitly reset it on each round trip

setinterval would be the better way than settimeout

setinterval is better than settimeout for this task

instead of a setinterval here settimeout will work far better

it uses settimeout however settimeout is a better solution than setinterval because it will only queue a new one if the previous one is complete

using settimeout is considered better than setinterval because of the screwy ways that js s event loop works

also setinterval is often better replaced by settimeout

so for scheduling purposes i suggest you to use the setinterval approach while the settimeout approach is better for delayed execution and asynchronous work

and else is explained why requestanimationframe is better than setinterval or settimeout

settimeout is better than setinterval here because setinterval will start at every 5 secs but settimeout will start once each time your job is done and wait for 5 seconds which will make your script adaptive to server response timings

this is also one of the few places i think you d be better off with setinterval rather than settimeout

then again it s better than settimeout setinterval which fires only once per second if the tab is not active in google chrome a common use case for audio file listening

i thought about using the setinterval function instead but because i am dealing with multiple functions i thought settimeout would be better

i also faced the same problem and i fixed it by writing a new controller and a view for the div to be refreshed and then used setinterval actually settimeout worked better for my requirement

i understand from searching on so that setinterval is a better way to approach this that settimeout which i was using initially but i haven t figured out how to specify that the function needs to repeat


longer delay time
the delay for setinterval and settimeout can be longer than the specified time

note that both settimeout and setinterval may take longer than the given delay to run though that shouldn t be an issue here

if there is a long execution time the execution time is greater than settimeout or setinterval to set the time


need method useful
setinterval is more useful than settimeout here as it recurs automatically and you don t need to keep setting it

settimeout is more relevant than setinterval since the first method just waits for a delay and executes a logic whereas the second function is meant for repeating a logic on periodic intervals

as for me settimeout is simpler than setinterval in this case as you won t need to clearinterval in the end of the array

well setinterval and settimeout essentially try to do the same thing but for your case setinterval method will be more accurate than settimeout

now a routine to initiate once per second - settimeout is usually more useful than setinterval


function slower timeout
settimeout evaluates your function once setinterval is more suited to call your chrono at specified interval

to make it infinite loop you have to wrap all these code inside a function and use only one setinterval because using more than one can damage your program and use a settimeout to delay the second pragragh bb class changes this is the function that i came up with

this is the proper solution don t ever rely on passing a string as a function when using settimeout or setinterval it s slower because it has to be evaluated and it just isn t right

the function settimeout is intended for a single timeout so using setinterval would be a more appropriate option


timers timer several
setinterval is much more suited for countdown timers and things you need to run continually since settimeout only runs once and you need to keep on calling it

the use of one settimeout timer is more preferably than several setinterval timers


little performance cleaner
i find setinterval is a little cleaner than chaining settimeout calls

and im not shure about this statement javascript likes settimeout more than setinterval which gives a little performance boost


solaris	aix---------------------------------------------------

tools bash newer
and i do as much work as possible on our linux centos 5 system simply because the tools on it are still newer than anything i can find readily packaged for aix solaris is somewhat better

that would be quite difficult the -i flag in sed additional options in find so getting bash installed on solaris aix might be a better way


median	minimum---------------------------------------------------

touchesbegan	touchesended---------------------------------------------------

hint active seconds
if the value of touchesended is more than 3 seconds beyond the current time and the time of touchesbegan is still before touchesended then it s time to show your hint

if the value of touchesbegan is greater than touchesended then an active touch is going on


factors	matrix---------------------------------------------------

x x.getrow size
however it still performs worse by initially a factors of 3 but as the matrix size increases asymptotically worse by a factors of exactly 2

however that is much worse by a factors of 10000 than what i am currently doing which is for matrix x for putting and x.getrow idx .todense for taking


skip-lists	tree---------------------------------------------------

faster balanced asymptotic
that is not exactly what i was expecting from skip-lists algoriths have the same asymptotic expected time bounds as balanced tree and are simple faster and use less space pug89

skip-lists algorithms have the same asymptotic expected time bounds as balanced tree and are simpler faster and use less space


data b different
in a single thread world is different you can use a sorted set a binary tree or your custom data structure that would perform better than concurrent skip-lists

thus write-heavy data structures are probably better implemented mutably and with something like a skip-lists where you only need to lock locally while read-heavy data structures are probably better implemented immutably where a tree is a more natural data structure

the most simple would be an array but a double-ended queue or an indexed skip-lists b tree could be better depending on the data size we are talking about


search lists performance
so as you can see the random binary search tree was rather a lot better than the skip-lists

balanced binary search tree will perform more poorly than a skip-lists in such a case as skip lists require no rebalancing and skip lists are also inherently sorted like a bst

skip-lists isn t any more difficult to implement than a self-balancing binary tree and gives much better performance in some situations

i doubt that the skip-lists was the better choice than an e.g an avl tree even in 1989


stringr	stringi---------------------------------------------------

ssl	spdy---------------------------------------------------

trie	tree---------------------------------------------------

table computational overhead
for cases where each node in the trie has most of its children used the trie is substantially more space efficient and time efficient than th ternary search tree

for example the patricia trie or the radix tree that is far more space efficient than an hash table for strings but of course being a tree lookup computational complexity is o log n and building it is o n log n

however that space overhead can be reduced by compressing the trie using the patricia tree representation using a more efficient data structure to store child pointers or building a dawg from the trie


redix binary article
as suggested a trie would be more efficient than a binary tree but you can use a hashmap and hash each word

use a radix tree wiki or trie wiki if you are concerned about performance.the radix tree is more memory efficient compared to a trie

a trie is better suited to this kind of thing because it lets you store your symbols as a tree and quickly parse it to match values or reject them

the article says that a trie is better than binary tree as for a string of length m for trie it takes o m time and for binary tree it takes o m logn time

a trie is better than a binary search tree for searching elements

the suffix tree is lighter and faster than the trie and is used to index dna or optimize some large web search engines

most likely a trie is more efficient and you didn t sort your dictionary and it doesn t use a binary tree or ternary tree

a suffix tree is more or less an advanced trie here you can also search for any substrings in o c as for the trie

also you can use redix trie or suffix tree these are far better suited for this kind of operations and much faster but they require a pre-processing of the data and might require more processing power

in this case a general trie might be easier to deal than the more specialized radix tree but the requirements in space are a bit higher

a suffix tree has less dummy nodes than the suffix trie

recursive is usually used for traversal and binary search tree but this tree is more similar to trie of only 2 character in alphabet

note that while a trie works for the specific case of keys which are strings a binary search tree is much more general and only requires that the keys can be ordered

a ternary tree trie would be more efficient

a radix tree will provide a better memory usage for strings than a regular trie if you have a lot of strings with common roots prefixes which is probably the case for a dictionary words with many forms - although that would probably depend on the language

a radix search tree trie might be more suitable than a hash if you re mapping from string to integer


floating-point	fractions---------------------------------------------------

type int precision
therefore ieee 754 single precision floating-point format has 23-bits fractions and int type has 32 bits so if the integer is larger than 2 24-1 the float type can t represent it exactly

a floating-point format with a n-bit fractions can t represent the integer which is larger than 2 n+1 -1 because it will lose the precision


uilabel	uibutton---------------------------------------------------

cpython	ironpython---------------------------------------------------

things slower virtual
ironpython is faster than c# in certain areas but not faster than cpython however you can link ironpython to any language thus over coming problems but then again you can do the same with cpython

also on implementations like jython or ironpython could be a lot slower than with cpython

if there s any heavy application logic as opposed to all of the work being networking files database ironpython is much faster than cpython at a few things and much slower at a few others so you probably need to profile and perf-test before you go too far down either path

it s possible that jython and ironpython are much faster than cpython as well as they are backed by heavily optimized virtual machines jvm and .net clr

it seems ironpython is just slower than cpython for reading text files


conclusion faster
consequently ironpython is potentially faster than cpython is especially for multithreading scenarios

i m not sure exactly how you re drawing the conclusion that ironpython is faster than cpython


fossil	git---------------------------------------------------

mockito	easymock---------------------------------------------------

prng	random---------------------------------------------------

source numbers pseudorandom
would it maybe be wise to use this somewhat dynamic memory usage as a seed for a prng to generate more quickly random numbers

if you seed a prng from a truly random source and then just keep calling the prng to get more numbers then you will just have a pseudorandom sequence of numbers albeit well seeded


rand good non-random
the non-random random behaviour is more a reflection on the quality of the rand prng â it is often not very good

then you use it as seed in random which is less good that one is a non-cryptographic prng and its output may exhibit some structure which will not register in a statistical measurement tool but might be exploited by an intelligent attacker


ubuntu	centos---------------------------------------------------

libraries compilers rhel
newer rhel centos have newer compilers but i d actually recommend ubuntu s lts versions

this is because your ubuntu system has newer system libraries than your centos one


fontfamily	font-size---------------------------------------------------

jboss	weblogic---------------------------------------------------

hmac	pbkdf2---------------------------------------------------

datamapper	activerecord---------------------------------------------------

idea better legitimate
so far the only legitimate reason i ve found to use datamapper over activerecord is that datamapper is better in terms of the single responsibility principle -- because the database rows are not the actual objects being persisted but with propel that doesn t really concern me because it s generated code anyway

datamapper is newer than activerecord

so a question for those who know better is datamapper newer than activerecord

datamapper idea is definitely better than activerecord


asynchronous model complex
datamapper is potentially more complex then activerecord but it s a lot easier to develop your domain model and database asynchronous then with activerecord

both use the activerecord pattern so you ll actually get your database tables back in objects without fancy domain logic but datamapper is way easier to work with and is thread-safe

from my point of view the datamapper model is much easier to grasp but since activerecord is the defacto standard it feels weird to change the orm just for this little problem


cakephp	yii---------------------------------------------------

curve smaller frameworks
yii has a higher learning curve than say codeigniter and cakephp

if you employ php frameworks like codeigniter yii maybe even cakephp which have comparatively smaller learning curves you will find your path wellpaved for you in php


gitolite	gitosis---------------------------------------------------

best better
i know gitolite better than gitosis

for this the best option is gitolite better than gitosis


mouse	trackpad---------------------------------------------------

rcurl	httr---------------------------------------------------

new wrapper http
the httr package is a bit nicer than rcurl for making http requests in my opinion and it sets a user-agent string by default

the new package httr provides a wrapper around rcurl to make it easier to scrape all kinds of pages


crossover	mutation---------------------------------------------------

onresume	onpause---------------------------------------------------

draggable	droppable---------------------------------------------------

point item element
the draggable is covering more than one droppable element and at this point there are multiple event.target.id s being covered

the problem you outlined is that the droppable is allowing more than 1 draggable item to be placed inside of it


div bigger width
it works nicely but from the rich ui perspective it s boring so i was wondering since the draggable image is bigger than the droppable how could i do assuming it s possible to have the droppable container suck the bigger image until if fills its dimensions

the draggable div is 3 times bigger than one droppable

alternatively you could set a width on your draggable which is less than twice the width of your droppable area or combine a set width with one of the above options for a better user experience

it seems like the draggable element including the margin is bigger than the droppable element and therefore the dropped status is set although the element does not seems to touch the upper droppable yet

it s just a hunch but maybe it s only a matter of the size of your draggable being too big and being over more than one droppable item

apparently the draggable li element is bigger than the droppable div because the li is block size and the div has a 150px width

how can i make the two droppable div s to not accept more than one draggable elements

and the size of the draggable div s should be smaller than the droppable div so that they fit in the droppable container

but i have a problem dragging to a droppable that is smaller than the draggable

when i made dimension of draggable div smaller than droppable div then drop event triggered successfully

for draggable set higher z-index than droppable so that draggable will always be visible over droppable

as the width of the draggable element is greater than the placeholder i can t get the placeholder to accept the draggable element to be droppable

i can make this work if the z-index of the droppable is less than the container but then you can t see where the draggable is since it s hidden behind the container

p.s this will only work if the draggable is smaller than droppable which is true in this case

this means that your draggable is the full width of the container which is much wider than the droppable and thus can t possibly intersect by 50

i want when draggable div dragged into droppable div the droppable div color get another color then draggable div width height get bigger and exactly fit to droppable div

perhaps you find it strange since the target droppable s size is much smaller than the draggable

the draggable div is greater in height and width than droppable div

i have a draggable parent element ice cream wrapper which is bigger than the droppable one teeth

when the draggable item is larger than the droppable div for some reason it will always place the appointment in the droppable div box that is directly below the one i am targetting

because you have not set a width on your draggable they are much wider than double your droppable width

this overlap is somewhat forced when the draggable is bigger than the droppable

how can i make the droppable to not accept more than one draggable div


ability futher drop
once a draggable is dropped onto the droppable remove the ability for both the draggable and droppable to be futher dragged and dropped in the drop event

when the ajax call completes and the status code is a 200 you do some minor css tweaks and then disable the ability of the droppable from receiving any more draggable items


mbunit	mstest---------------------------------------------------

test features manpower
nunit is more widespread mbunit has the most features but mstest has more manpower behind it

i ve read time and time again that tdd test first is more difficult with mstest than it is with other testing frameworks such as nunit mbunit etc.


configobj	configparser---------------------------------------------------

built-in easier
i have heard that configobj is easier to use than configparser even though it is not a built-in library

i ve heard that configobj is easier to work with than configparser


octal	binary---------------------------------------------------

conversion human practice
hex and octal are just shorter ways to write binary

the conversion between binary and either octal or hex is even easier than decimal

with a little practice hex or octal are easier for a human than binary


cpu	hyperthreading---------------------------------------------------

chip intel physical
the rule of thumb is that if a cpu is given more than double the count of actively running threads as it has execution units these are the physical cores on a cpu chip and logical processors like hyperthreading technology that splits one core into two then the os will spend more time scheduling threads and switching between them cache-thrashing than it will spend actually running the threads

a quad core intel cpu s with hyperthreading enabled has 4 physical cores yet 8 logical processors hyperthreading creates 4 more logical processors


non-hyper-threading i7 processing
now - your i7 cpu have 4 cores + hyperthreading which results in more threads spawned for processing thus you can get more exceptions because for example 4 things can be processed at the same time when exception occurs

non-hyper-threading cores each correspond to 1 cpu whereas hyperthreading cores contain more than 1 typically 2 - logical - cpu


memcached	apc---------------------------------------------------

caching database opcode
apc is more an opcode caching system than a key value memory database like memcached altough it can be greatly used for both purposes

memcached is more for caching database queries and improving performance in that regard while apc is more for improving performance of php code


faster single slower
apc is faster on a single server - but memcached is distributed

a quick googling says that apc is 5 times faster than memcached

as you know apc is much more faster than memcached if we re fetching keys from a single server

in my case apc is 59 times faster than memcached

apc access is a bit faster something like 5 times faster than memcached if i remember correctly as it s only local -- no network involved

it s slower than apc but it s faster than memcached redis etc

memcached has more functionality but is intended for distributed environments while apc works on single servers only

memcached is in-memory too and a bit slower than apc

if everything works use apc or memcached instead of files files usually work great but apc memc are faster

i would choose option 1 for better performances apc or memcached are faster storage than filesystem and for having more control on what s happening in your project

memcached around 4-5 times slower than apc but run as a single process that can be touched everywhere in my environment

my experience say that apc is nearly 7-8 times faster than memcached


results setup nature
on a single server setup i am assuming apc would be better then memcached for this

if you site is located on single box you will get much better results with apc which unlike memcached is not distributed by nature


retrofit	okhttp---------------------------------------------------

solution different volley
the basic one and i think the simplest is okhttp but you have to understand that okhttp is no more supported but still work when you downgrade your sdkversion the best solution is to use volley or retrofit

first you have many different library you can use instead of retrofit the basic one and i think the simplest is okhttp but you have to understand that okhttp is no more supported but still work when you downgrade your sdkversion and you can use volley to perform the same service as retrofit


pure better objects
note that if you have json and rest then retrofit is going to be better than pure okhttp

if you want to use json objects with okhttp retrofit would be a better library


multiplication	modulo---------------------------------------------------

addition slower integer
it might seem unintuitive but it has a lower precedence than multiplication addition and modulo operations

note parentheses are redundant as division and multiplication have the same priority and modulo has higher precedence over addition

multiplication division and modulo have the same precedence and they all have higher precedence than addition and subtraction

it appears that you consider modulo to have lower precedence than multiplication and division when in fact it does not

integer multiplication division and modulo are much slower than integer addition and subtraction


spaces	linefeed---------------------------------------------------

urwid	ncurses---------------------------------------------------

viewdidload	viewwillappear---------------------------------------------------

place location viewdidappear
you may find using viewdidload rather than viewwillappear or viewdidappear may work better in this case you can set your view up with a loading holding graphic or animation trigger your asynchronous networking call and then once complete display the required information

if you insist on having the location before viewdidload is called viewwillappear would be a better place then you have to hold off pushing that viewcontroller until you have a sufficient location

in your viewdidload on the second view or viewwillappear is probably better set the background image to the image you put in the property


inline	inlining---------------------------------------------------

compiler keyword function
generally speaking the inline keyword is used more now to allow you to violate the one definition rule when you define a function in a header than to give the compiler a hint about inlining

the inline keyword makes it easier for the compiler to apply this optimization by allowing the function definition to be visible in multiple translation units but using the keyword doesn t mean the compiler has to inline the function and not using the keyword doesn t forbid the compiler from inlining the function

if your compiler can do this then writing functions in a way that the compiler is able to inline is better than manually inlining the calls yourself

early inlining is the compiler s ability to inline a function early on when it sees the call costs more than the inline

the keyword inline is more about telling the compiler that the symbol will be present in more than one object file without violating the one definition rule than about actual inlining which the compiler can decide to do or not to do


simple method worse
i have no problem with methods declared inline in a header in some cases - a struct s constructor a simple method where inlining measurably makes it faster we have some math functions like this etc

while function calls can be a little worse than inline code for very simple operations repeated inlining of non-trivial functions can create arbitrarily worse code bloat


tail fatter call
we inline the call instead inlining is way better than tail calling and opens the door to many more optimizations

inlining inlining produces fatter code which is faster the inline functions will not appear in the call stack


smaller size estimate
but as the inline code gets longer the savings for inlining become smaller so maybe you could just have a hard limit on the size of the code - any code to be inline must be smaller than the limit

the decision to inline is based on an estimate as to whether inlining will result in smaller code size


datalist	repeater---------------------------------------------------

struts	stripes---------------------------------------------------

profiling	debugging---------------------------------------------------

faster better consuming
time spent learning a profiling is probably better spent than time writing and debugging micro-benchmarks

edit i guess release is much faster than debugging but why is this profiling so time consuming


jruby	mri---------------------------------------------------

slower hotspot opposite
for example jruby is faster than mri jruby 1.7 is faster than jruby 1.6 jruby 1.7 running on hotspot is faster than jruby 1.7 running on j9 jruby 1.7 running on hotspot 1.7 is faster than jruby 1.7 running on hotspot 1.6 jruby 1.7 running on hotspot 1.7 with the c2 compiler is faster than jruby 1.7 running on hotspot 1.7 with the c1 compiler and so on

this really surprised me because i expected mri to be slower than jruby

same passenger + mri 2.3.0 is 3 times faster than puma + jruby on same rack app

does this mean that the old adagio about jruby being faster than mri ruby is gone

mri is faster than jruby

mri was faster than jruby

so it seems like the opposite - mri 2.3 gets 2-5x slower than jruby 9.1

jruby is faster than 1.9 mri matz ruby interpreter the standard in certain areas

and it sounds strange but jruby scales very well and it s faster than mri with java 7

mri has a gil so why is it faster than jruby in handling requests


rubies efficiency global
works on some rubies better than others jruby is recommended efficiency on mri is decreased due to gvl global vm lock

works on some rubies better than others jruby and rubinius are recommended efficiency on mri is decreased due to gvl global vm lock

in practice this means that deploying a rails app to jruby is a good idea as is running your integration tests but for developer unit tests and scripts mri yarv or rubinius are better choices


better processes right
with these options jruby on rails gives about the same or better performance than mri

for longer-running applications like a web application rubinius or jruby will generally perform better than mri

if you are set on using ruby you might want to compare mri to jruby from my experience with the latter and profilers like jvisualvm i wouldn t be surprised if jruby fared better

sometimes mri is faster but with the right parameters and warmup jruby was 3 to 3.5 times as fast on my system for this particular

i know that rails jruby handles concurrency better than mri but i don t know how to do it

lastly if you are frequently finding yourself running long running process i advice you to try jruby which is works much better with long running processes due to jvm lot faster than mri


raw performant cpu
jvm hosted languages are generally going to be faster than traditional mri ruby and both java and scala are generally faster than jruby when it comes to raw cpu capabilities

once the jvm has warmed up rails requests under jruby are usually significantly more performant than under mri both in terms of raw execution speed and garbage collection


multiplying	subtract---------------------------------------------------

first interpolated lambda
subtract first field from the other and if the value is not greater than 0 multiplying by -1

if the parameter is greater than 0.5 multiplying lambda by two and subtract one this maps onto and return the interpolated color between color b and color c


precedence example john
multiplying and divide have higher precedence than add and subtract

since multiplication has a higher precedence than subtraction you should subtract 0 to your digit character before multiplying it

to give multiplying and divide higher precedence than add and subtract you can do something like this example adapted from john levine lex yacc 2 e 1992


margin	font-size---------------------------------------------------

headings jsfiddle element
if you don t want to give padding or margin at all then set the line-height property of headings more than their font-size

i don t understand why the height of span element more than its font-size margin and padding 0 jsfiddle example


bmp	png---------------------------------------------------

format compression note
i recommend not to use jpg as mask because of its lossy format i recommend bmp or png bmp is better

note that the png format is much more complex than bmp since it allows compression etc


faster slower
i have a sample wpf app here and wondering why bmp is loading faster than png

jpg png is slower to draw than a bmp


gif jpeg vector
i haven t worked with any more than jpg png and gif so there might be some more image types out there that can fit into this function bmp

gif jpeg png bmp are more standard than any vector format where usually adobe has the market

jpg jpeg bmp png webp gif svg js map ico css less scss


uninstall	upgrade---------------------------------------------------

reinstall new old
the old upgrade was more an uninstall and a reinstall

the upgrade works correctly but if uninstall new build for example build 9 and install an old one example 3 i got an error although nothing currently installed on my machine this versioning is older than installed one


gif	ico---------------------------------------------------

bazaar	git---------------------------------------------------

possible type flexibility
some version control systems bazaar hg git make this easier than others but it s possible on most

but distributed version control systems like git mercurial and bazaar are much better suited for your type of environment than subversion

this type of flexibility is what draws me to bazaar despite the fact that git is wildly more popular and faster


purpose enough numbers
that being said the message conveyed on python-dev was that all of them git mercurial bazaar are better than subversion for the most part they are fast enough and the choice of mercurial over git bazaar was mostly based on the gut feelings of the bfdl and the attendees of pycon2009

an incredibly rough eye balling of the numbers they posted showed bazaar to be 2-4x slower than either git or mercurial in the use cases tested

distributed version control systems such as mercurial bazaar or git are better suited for such tasks

you may also want to take a look at why git is better than x a site that attempts to convince you of the superiority of git over mercurial bazaar subversion and perforce

i hear all this stuff about bazaar being slower than git

mercurial is significantly faster than bazaar it s slower than git though by a much smaller difference

a lot of articles about bazaar will tell you it is a lot slower than git or mercurial

mercurial is not designed for this purpose and i don t think bazaar or git would be more fun on this

subversion git mercurial or bazaar would be better choices


onclick	onchange---------------------------------------------------

events button radio
here s something that should get you started - this is all based on the assumption that there are only 3 checkboxes on your whole page and that you re interested in all of them - you ll want to make a method like this respond to your checkbox elements onclick events - i ve found that to be more reliable than onchange

note that onclick is better supported with checkbox and radio button than is onchange

express	node.js---------------------------------------------------

tunnel	vpn---------------------------------------------------

try-catch	exception-handling---------------------------------------------------

better constructor output
if you are writing a constructor which could throw an exception-handling you had better make sure you clean up anything you need to by using using or try-catch block

going beyond that you can use a try-catch block to gracefully handle those exception-handling and provide better output logging options


faster slower if-clause
in java you can call option s isempty isdefined and get without any special hassle the really useful option methods such as getorelse are another matter. checking the result of the isdefined method in an if-clause should be faster than checking exception-handling in a try-catch block

try-catch is actually slower if there really is an exception-handling thrown


prepare	execute---------------------------------------------------

variables array security
i ve updated the answer to use bind variables so that using prepare will give you more security and then you can either bind the values or using pdo execute with the array of bind values

is there a way to allow the number of parameters passed thru pdo execute to be greater than the number of tokens identified in the prepare statement


method infrequent sooner
prepare statements are much faster if you execute the same sql and just change parameters in it

prepare statements are slightly faster when execute repeatedly because the mysql server has to parse the sql and run the query planner optimizer only once

yes if one sql statement is execute repeatedly using prepare statements is much better

using a solution such as a prepare statement where it is not possible for a user to directly influence the actual sql query being execute is a safer alternative

if i didn t get it wrong prepare statements are faster because they are sent only the first time to the rdbms and then only the parameters are sent when it needs to be execute

prepare statements are sent to the database which checks it for errors and also optimizes it so that consecutive calls to the execute method are performed faster

any execute statement becomes prepare sooner or later it need to be parsed optimized compiled and then execute

prepare statements are faster to execute if used repeatedly

2 executemany is better than execute as it makes for you the prepare statement

this would be so much handy to be able to send execute statement in one shot as the prepare query are way better in term of security if i go with the query method i will have to escape manually my parameters...

my question is how can i execute more than 1 prepare statement

prepare execution is faster than direct execution for statements execute more than three or four times because the statement is compiled only once while statements execute directly are compiled each time they are execute

using prepare and execute should be faster safer easier and it won t make you feel like you re writing php in 1999

performance occasionally - it is true that prepare statements are vastly quicker when execute many times but in practice this is very infrequent


opera	google-chrome---------------------------------------------------

pixels lower right
on linux google-chrome displays text about one pixel higher than firefox and opera

on your screenshot div width in opera is bigger than in firefox and google-chrome

in safari it is several pixels higher up than in firefox and google-chrome and significantly lower in opera

according to some - browser - statistics ie6 market share is still bigger than google-chrome safari and opera together nearly as much as ie7

why in firefox text smaller left than in google-chrome and opera right


thier quicker powerful
on all of the other browsers i ve tried safari opera ie google-chrome it looks much less nice because all of those browsers scroll half a screen at a time

in fact i ran some tests at dhtml kitchen and found that in firefox opera and google-chrome document.write was actually faster on the first load and comparable in speed of standard html on subsequent refreshes

the idea is that if they are using ie then they must install google-chrome frame and if they are using less than firefox 4 or opera 11.5 then they must upgrade their browser not not sure if the way i am doing that is correct

this may not be related as google-chrome and opera are working faster but what may be happening is your server is still trying to get the content and is not done processing the html this is what a video application i wrote in php did before i fixed it

much better than opera firefox and google-chrome

after running a modified version of esailija s jsfiddle test to include the documentfragment it doesn t seem to make any difference in google-chrome or opera for that matter so it appears as though google-chrome is simply slower

this code to date is only supported by a couple of the major browsers namely google-chrome 37 and opera 24 see more details here

look every browser like mozilla firefox google-chrome opera have thier own design for modal window

usually you want to avoid solutions from browser-vendor as they ll cater toward that specific browser but opera webkit google-chrome safari firefox devs are usually more knowledgeable in terms of cross-browser solutions and compliance with the standards than m ones

but if firebug donâ t enabled after launch firefox â time equal 2ms that faster than opera and google-chrome and difference between empty filled array disappears

firefox google-chrome opera and safari all handle it better

conclusion diff1 is faster in firefox opera and safari diff2 is faster in ie and google-chrome

it s way faster on ie but other major browsers firefox google-chrome safari and opera perform better when using a container and then appending it fragment or div

fireofx google-chrome safari and opera has better css selectors support compare to ie

but on all of the mobile browsers i ve tried firefox google-chrome opera it s much smaller around 25 of the size specified

the animations are slower than google-chrome and opera

the results varied from a browser to another firefox 4.0b12 is faster using but google-chrome webkit and opera is faster when using

using any other browser google-chrome firefox and opera it s much quicker

since you noted thoughts on other browsers would be helpful opera s kiosk mode seems more powerful than google-chrome s

all the webkit-based browsers safari google-chrome and opera should be closer in their rendering to each other than firefox or ie 9 separately

according to w3counter ie6 is used by more people than opera safari and any version of google-chrome

it seems to be slower in google-chrome and firefox but is significantly faster in opera

all my other browsers safari google-chrome and opera have newer javascript versions

note how browsers that use v8 google-chrome opera 20 are slower with the delete than without it


lwjgl	jogl---------------------------------------------------

super	extends---------------------------------------------------

inclusive upper lower
where extends is an upper bound super is a lower bound

super is a lower bound and extends is an upper bound

yes super and extends gives inclusive lower and upper bounds respectively


single-quotes	double-quotes---------------------------------------------------

theano	keras---------------------------------------------------

swt	swing---------------------------------------------------

different awt best
these two are completely different logically speaking and you should choose only one of them to go further with note that swt is more customizable and tries to combine the best from awt and swing while swing is more limited and uses the platform s native widgets

ps i m not set on swt if anybody thinks a different library technology such as swing awt is better


easier simpler android
give swt a go the api is a lot simpler than swing

into swing application i like to avoid using it with swt but is its more easier its ok

however there is a desktop application framework called griffon that uses the same language as grails groovy which should be easier than using swing or swt

so in my view using swing is simply easier unless you have more experience in swt

it can be hard to get the layuots exact the way you want in swt it s usually easier in swing

probably you should start with something simpler than networking swing swt and android


opinion nicer api
having used it myself in my opinion it s also far nicer than swing in its api more like swt in that respect looks far nicer by default and far more flexible in what it allows you to do

i find swt to be an uglier api than swing in general though but not really a deal breaker

in my opinion swing is easier to learn and to use but the results of swt are often nicer - you can often feel that a swing application behaves not completely right


gui technologies weaker
swing is the weaker of the gui technologies relating to accessibility in java compared to swt at any rate

if you plan for long term i don t see more options than swt or swing for gui development in java


faster modern enough
swt is claimed to be faster than swing although in modern versions swing is also fast enough

as for swing vs swt netbeans gui considerably faster than eclipse.


toolbar	tabs---------------------------------------------------

subclass	abstract-class---------------------------------------------------

minimal interface nothing
but unless you re using such excellent testing practices and patterns i d be suspicious of abstractions that have a single concrete example -- interfaces with just one implementation no less than abstract-class with just one concrete subclass

write the application differently - create a matching interface and write the service provider implementation against it testing that and also write a minimal subclass of the abstract-class that does nothing more than forward calls to the interface


inline-functions	inlining---------------------------------------------------

width	font-size---------------------------------------------------

time fittext exact
you can then check if the width of the text is greater than 800px and reduce the font-size until the width is less than or equal to

when you are using fittext at that time if the font-size is greater than 100px than you have to set the exact width as per your font-size

if the width is greater than the fixed width bump the font-size down and then check the width again

that is repeatedly reduce the font-size by 5 until the total width is less than or equal to 800px


increase font 16px
you can remove the transform s and the margin-left and add a width set as 0 here smaller than the font-size 16px here to the get the effect

if width of text element is bigger than width of container decrease font-size by some value for example by 0.1px and go to step 3

obs the font-size must be dynamic having text height limited by container height when container width is larger than text width and limited by container width when container width is smaller then text width

the only font-size is on the body tag but what happens is that the div is square but the button has a smaller height than its width

determine if the span s width is greater than the useable width of the input element and update the font-size accordingly

i ve also experimented with the line-height also when decreasing both height and line-height to 1 px the added height gets worse and font-size i ve put the height and width as attributes instead of inline css a div inside the td etc

that being said using viewport units for font-size in the above way is problematic because when the viewport width is much smaller - say 320px - then the rendered font size will become 0.03 x 320 9.6px which is very too small

if you dont want to crop the image at all or use javascript i think your only choice is to force the text element to have the same proportions as the image with width approximately being 50 larger than height and then adjust the font-size text elements to fit the container

once the clone s width is less than or equal to the input element s width we delete the clone element and set the input s font-size

from there on the width slowly increases again as the part of the string still on line 1 linearly gets wider as the font-size increases

i initialize the loop with this value and increment the font-size with 1 until the string is wider than the width of the containing element

as it fit for device but as font-size increase in both width and height so fonts and elements were messing up because font-size was bigger with respect to width

as you can see the font-size of the text is bit larger than the width of the noisy lines


piston	tastypie---------------------------------------------------

query luck similar
edit i found out that piston was proposing query throttling but everywhere people say that tastypie is better than piston

- similar to piston but i ve had better luck with tastypie


switching	screens---------------------------------------------------

virtual 90px portrait
if the sum of all the listview item s height is greater than the screens height you switching the layout type for one where you have a viewgroup relative layout with a listview without the footer on the top and a linearlayout at the bottom the desired footer

but then i noticed after changing a mobile to landscape it would switching back to the desktop mode due to the width of the media query being less than the screens landscape width

i ve got a responsive ad unit on my page and for some reason it has a height of 60px while i really need it to be 90px and switching to 300x250 when screens gets smaller

if the screens become smaller it switching to the next row but all the buttons are centered in the middel

content height is smaller than screens height is because of the virtual key back home switching app

i ve already built a view that can take a drawable can use focused pinch-zoom and drag can auto-scale images can switching images dynamically and takes images larger than the screens

but when the screens is smaller than 900px we switching from fixed to liquid via media query switching to a liquid width will allow our images to scale down our text to wrap and a whole bunch of other great things

switching between landscape and portrait changes nothing the width is still larger than the screens

and then switching their display-properties when the screens is smaller than x px

i am using view flipper to show bunch on images like a slider where i implemented the functionality of swipe left and right to switching images now some of my images are larger than the screens size in terms of height are getting hidden

however when i switching to landscape mode the listview is taller than the screens

i understand you are trying to load more events that are currently shown on screens so that they are cached and prev next switching works faster

when the screens size is smaller i have it switching flex-direction to column which works well except i cannot figure out how to make the 2nd row trending down start where the trending up stops where ever that may be


django	web.py---------------------------------------------------

symfony	kohana---------------------------------------------------

mouseout	mouseenter---------------------------------------------------

accurate mouseup mousedown
in this case mouseenter mouseleave has better behaviour and prevents bubbling compared to mouseover mouseout

imho mouseenter and mouseleave are much more reliable than mouseover and mouseout which tend to flicker

this may make for various race conditions and may necessitate using events which give you earlier notification than mouseup mousedown mouseenter mouseleave mouseover mouseout

some browsers implement the mouseenter mouseleave events that i ve noticed are more accurate than mouseout

also you might want to use mouseenter and mouseleave which are sanitized by jquery and are a little more reliable than mouseover and mouseout

it should also be noted that mouseenter and mouseleave work somewhat differently and usually much better than mouseover and mouseout

because jquery doesn t use mouseover and mouseout it uses mouseenter and mouseleave which are more suited to this scenario

i have no idea about the classes but i think mouseenter and mouseleave are better alternative for mouseout and mouseover


ggplot2	lattice---------------------------------------------------

easier
i know it is much easier by using ggplot2 but i need to get it done by lattice

maybe lattice or ggplot2 would offer easier way to do this


macports	homebrew---------------------------------------------------

emacs version newer
install newer emacs by homebrew or macports

i m using homebrew as it s newer than macports and i don t know enough to choose between them

usually you use homebrew or macports to install a newer version


bower	npm---------------------------------------------------

slower similar component
like npm bower is slower than component at installing has an unnecessary publish step does not support multiple versions of dependencies and does not cache installations

bower is more similar to npm than to component


cos	sin---------------------------------------------------

series component-wise theta
this requires computing cos theta and sin theta just once and then each update is given by a matrix multiplication of a 2x2 matrix with a 2-d vector and then a simple addition which is faster than computing sin using the power series expansion

so if we have a vector and want to calculate a component-wise function over it say sin and cos it is faster to use vvsincos from accelerate because it will pipeline the calculations of sin and cos for all the entries in the vector which is faster than using a for-loop over the vector


sqrt easier cheaper
the jni sincos is better than computing sin and cos but the sqrt approach is still faster

the opengl sin cos implementation has probably higher precision but not by much

constexpr but something like sin or cos would be trickier so is there

if you re after a plain parametrization using sin and cos it s way easier

an two for a function like sqrt i could probably write my own constexpr but something like sin or cos would be trickier so is there away around it

if i want to calculate a sin and a cos is it cheaper to calculate a sin and a cos or calculate a sin then a sqrt 1-sin 2 to get the cos

a possible implementation for the sin and cos functions making it easier to define additional functions in the future could be having a something like

polar is well-suited to rotation operations and scaling i guess but sticking with cartesian where a rotation is four multiplies see below is probably going to be cheaper than using cos sin acos asin every time you want to do a vector addition

one approach could work with the formula for a circle + -râ² xâ²+yâ² with r being the radius but i think a approach with cos and sin would be easier


m_pi accurate math.h
and my test result show it s more accurate than math.h s sin cos at -m_pi angle +m_pi range

is there any way to handle the numbers and or the sin cos arccos functions more accurate to make the outcome get better


faster slower angles
note that + and - are much faster than cos sin etc

performance is similar even 1 faster than cos and sin

however even this version is about 2-3 times faster than using sin and cos on every iteration

but java.lang.math.sin and cos are faster than any other way to calculate sin cos if you use angles between 0 and 45 degree

i ve just timed this and it is about 25 faster than using sin and cos

or maybe flip them on my machine sin seems faster than cos

after reading a question related with the performance of sin cos why is std sin and std cos slower than sin and cos

no for-loops or math.pow which is amazingly slow way slower than sin cos etc

if it s faster than sin cos then you can use the identity

this is faster than the nprect but still slower than sin and cos calls

in fact python s own sin and cos functions are faster than those of numpy if the argument is a single number

this way of doing movement is much faster than using sin and cos
