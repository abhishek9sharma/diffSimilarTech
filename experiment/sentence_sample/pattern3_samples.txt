 no 
ng-app	ng-controller
a ng-app can have more than 1 ng-controller

 yes 
sdl	xlib
in my experience xlib via mit-shm extension was significantly faster than sdl surfaces not sure i used sdl in the most optimal way though

 yes 
uicollectionview	uitableview
instead of using a uitableview in this instance perhaps you might consider using a uicollectionview - they are built for something like you describe more than a uitableview

 no 
mdpi	hdpi
try reading this link also for more study over hdpi and mdpi concept

 yes 
division	subtraction
division has higher precedence than subtraction so in the first two examples only the second number is being divided

 yes 
flask	django
django is very batteries included meaning that it comes with much more out-of-the-box than say flask and to me a large part of that the user auth system

 yes 
trie	tree
the article says that a trie is better than binary tree as for a string of length m for trie it takes o m time and for binary tree it takes o m logn time

 yes 
memcmp	strcmp
memcmp is simpler than strcmp and can be implemented even more efficiently in places where the strings are known to be properly aligned

 no 
vxworks	qnx
in the non open-source world choices are wider such as qnx neutrino and vxworks

 no 
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
the idea is that if they are using ie then they must install google-chrome frame and if they are using less than firefox 4 or opera 11.5 then they must upgrade their browser not not sure if the way i am doing that is correct

 yes 
int	chars
if i remember correctly int take up less storage than chars so you should go with int

 yes 
coalesce	isnull
on the subject of performance on sql server isnull often performs better than coalesce but the latter is ansi compliant if that is important to you


 yes 
uitableview	uisearchbar
uitableview is reporting a bigger contentsize than expected when using a uisearchbar


 yes 
post	get
generally when passing lots of data to the server to be processed or stored using post is a good idea since get has a lower limit than that of post

 no 
button	checkbox
the problem is that if i have more than one checkbox checked and i want to uncheck one the button disables

 yes 
apache	lighttpd
unlike a proper server like lighttpd whose cpu usage is undetectable the crummy via c was serving  http hits s and lighttpd used less than  cpu apache will kill your box

 yes 
floating-point	integer
it s even possible that you could implement pong using only integer arithmetic which is likely to be faster than floating-point -- but the difference is unlikely to be critical

 yes 
haskell	ocaml
the reason i wanted to investigate this was because both c and ocaml were significantly faster than haskell for this program

 yes 
udp	tcp
i was going through internet and so and understood that web sockets are encapsulations to tcp which by itself is slower than udp ofcourse at the cost of reliability but i couldnt find much info if websockets or udp would be ideal to implement such a server

 yes 
mp4	webm
i tried mp4 and webm and sometimes the file size after i convert to mp4 is smaller than webm but it is also sometimes larger than the original file size

 yes 
qlist	qvector
qvector will usually give better performance than qlist because qvector always stores its items sequentially in memory where qlist will allocate its items on the heap unless sizeof t sizeof void and t has been declared to be either a q_movable_type or a q_primitive_type using q_declare_typeinfo

 yes 
lxml	beautifulsoup
according to the above posts and my own experience lxml is definitely faster than beautifulsoup

 yes 
innodb	myisam
i am trying to compare the myisam and innodb write read performance but i am suprised that the myisam s read is much more slower than innodb while its write is much more faster this is totally opposite compared to what i have learned

 yes 
quicksort	heapsort
it is a variant of heapsort which is particularly suitable for the sorting of very large amounts of data if a relatively high cost per compare operation is needed and on average better than quicksort

 yes 
libsvm	liblinear
and how do the differences make liblinear faster than libsvm

 yes 
addition	multiplication
and the value of this expression evaluated according to the precedence rules is 62 because multiplication has higher precedence than addition

 yes 
innodb	myisam
after all innodb shouldn t be slower than myisam when using count + where but that s exactly what is happening here

 yes 
boost	stl
boost s io stream might be a better solution than stl s own stream

 yes 
move	drag
i got a draggable object done with jquery ui and when i drag it it s way slower than i move my mouse

 no 
uilabel	uitextview
textcontainer s height need to be set depending on the content height for it to work and that is no better than using uitextview or uilabel

 no 
google-chrome	firefox
ie handles updates better than google-chrome and firefox

 yes 
ati	nvidia
i m having an issue where my glsl 130 code wont run properly on my somewhat modern ati 5850 hardware while the identical code runs perfectly fine on an older laptop with a nvidia card i have

 yes 
orientdb	neo4j
using orientdb that is supposed ti be faster than neo4j for depth i m seeing a slow performance

 yes 
int	chars
in order for this to work reliably c should have type and unsigned int should be strictly wider than unsigned chars

 yes 
implements	extends
i have read that implements runnable is better than extends thread but i have no idea of how

 yes 
innodb	myisam
myisam is better than innodb when you don t need those advanced features and storage speed is more important than other concerns

 no 
postgresql	mysql
mongodb is fun to toy with and i ve built a few apps using it myself for that reason but it s almost never a better choice than postgresql mysql sql server etc

 yes 
google-chrome	firefox
in my experience google-chrome will be a lot faster than firefox to debug huge js files

 yes 
coalesce	isnull
you can use isnull also in place of coalesce as isnull is comparatively faster than coalesce

 yes 
mdpi	hdpi
and you know your image at hdpi folder so its 1.5 larger than the mdpi

 yes 
bower	npm
using npm package is a little bit harder than using bower package

 yes 
avplayer	avassetreader
measure how much faster than realtime avassetreader can decode at replace avplayer with your own metal + avassetreader path if you think that some performance has gotten lost in transit

 yes 
firefox	safari
in safari we found that the dom level 0 took twice the time off the dom level 2 but was still four times faster than either firefox case

 yes 
for-loop	loops
a loops using a callback function like the standard foreach was approximately 10 times slower than the for-loop

 yes 
yslow	pagespeed
in my testing so far google s pagespeed addon is far and above much better than yslow

 yes 
division	multiplication
on most processors division is slower than multiplication for the same data types

 yes 
jmeter	blazemeter
blazemeter is better than jmeter

 yes 
postgresql	mysql
given postgresql s reputation for doing things better than mysql or at least as good as i daresay that postgresql would demonstrate similar performance if properly used

 yes 
implements	extends
mvc is the most extensible and if you are familiar with how things work under the covers you ll probably be better off than implements a hard to extends ms thing like odata and wcf

 yes 
translation	localization
is the best solution to add a new column called engmaterial and add the english translation there or is it possible to solve this in a better way with localization in .net
