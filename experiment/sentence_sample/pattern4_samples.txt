yes 
google-chrome	firefox
in general i have found google-chrome to be more finnicky than firefox

yes 
udp	tcp
in my experience udp based code is generally less complex than tcp based code

yes 
keydown	keyup
keyup is more preferable than keydown because keydown may occur multiple times if user keeps it pressed

yes 
division	multiplication
the reason for doing so is to reduce hardware cost as division is more expensive than multiplication

yes 
division	multiplication
division is a lot more expensive than multiplication

yes 
coalesce	nvl
the coalesce function is used here because it is more portable than nvl or ifnull

yes 
addition	multiplication
also remember multiplication is much more expensive than addition

yes 
octal	hex
apparently octal format was more popular than hex format

yes 
codeigniter	cakephp
i have been reading about cakephp but it seems a bit more complicated than codeigniter

yes 
junit	testng
testng strives to be much more configurable than junit but in the end they both work equally well

yes 
uitableview	uipickerview
uitableview is much more customizable than uipickerview

yes 
memcpy	strcpy
the reason for not having strcpy i m guessing is that strcpy can be replaced more efficiently with memcpy for constant strings and if the string is not constant strcpy is a bit more complicated than memcpy anyway so not as beneficial to make inline optimisations for

yes 
post	get
post is also more secure than get because you aren t sticking information into a url

yes 
post	get
post is absolutely not more secure than get as to man in middle attacks

yes 
ant	maven
ant is much more powerful than maven in many respects but maven excels in dependency management and ease of deployment

yes 
cairngorm	puremvc
puremvc is more invasive than cairngorm meaning that your code is heavily dependent on the framework you have to subclass implement the framework classes interfaces but that doesn t mean that cairngorm isn t

yes 
apache	lighttpd
this is my first experience setting up lighttpd as i thought it would be more suitable than apache in this case

yes 
boost	stl
boost libraries are generally less mature and less standard than stl

yes 
trac	bugzilla
i would suggest something more modern than bugzilla such as trac or lighthouse although bugzilla may fit your bill

yes 
notepad++	sublimetext
notepad++ which is often recommended are even more broken than sublimetext 2 which i find to be pretty good actually

yes 
couchbase	couchdb
couchbase btw also uses binary replication mechanism which will be more efficient than couchdb as long as the couchdb protocol is not utilized for bidirectional data exchange and conflict resolution

yes 
innodb	myisam
for an oltp type system innodb is usually more sensible than myisam did you check the contention before trying a different engine

yes 
udp	tcp
you could get them to do a udp multicast within a lan environment to identify the programs using protocol messages then have a stored cache of each other s identity and then use tcp to connect and do main exchanging of messages which is more reliable than udp

yes 
division	multiplication
division and square roots for huge number of bits are not much more complex than multiplication

yes 
gitolite	gitosis
gitolite is far more advanced than gitosis and is quite easy to install directly from your workstation based on ssh communication with your git repository server

yes 
setinterval	settimeout
now a routine to initiate once per second - settimeout is usually more useful than setinterval

yes 
cassini	iis
perhaps you will have a more pleasant experience with iis 7.5 express as a replacement for cassini

yes 
udp	tcp
but there are some cases especially in iot domain udp is more popular than tcp for its bigger transport overheads

yes 
postgresql	mysql
postgresql is a little more strict than mysql about type conversion and does not let you implicitly cast convert between numbers and strings

yes 
setinterval	settimeout
setinterval is more useful than settimeout here as it recurs automatically and you don t need to keep setting it

yes 
implements	extends
they say that implements runnable is more preferrable than extends thread

yes 
junit	testng
i actually picked junit over testng for android testing i thought it was more lightweight than testng for on-device testing

yes 
apache	nginx
also you should consider using nginx as server that s more flexible than apache

no 
sse	avx
hardware-specific optimizations makes the code even more complex such as sse avx optimizations for x86 x64

yes 
hex	binary
hex encoding is far more readable than binary that s why sublime uses it

yes 
post	get
in effect post is no more secure than get

yes 
strcpy	strncpy
so that the strncpy is more secure than strcpy

yes 
namedtuple	dictionary
namedtuple should perform better less overhead than dictionary if the lists are long

yes 
ati	nvidia
more useful with nvidia than ati for example

yes 
uicollectionview	uitableview
finally you might want to look into uicollectionview which provides a lot more visual flexibility than uitableview and can be seen as a sort of generalization of the latter

yes 
postgresql	mysql
though mysql is more popular than postgresql but instagram is using postgresql maybe due to these reasons

yes 
opennlp	stanford-nlp
but if you will look at the accuracy level stanford-nlp have more accurate detection than opennlp

yes 
onclick	onmouseup
note also that onclick would be much more appropriate than onmouseup for this

yes 
google-chrome	firefox
first just a heads up you may want to try firebug+firepath on firefox which is a more handy tool than google-chrome s developer tool

no 
udp	tcp
i would recommend against taking this decision lightly it s a good deal more complex than tcp udp amqp etc

yes 
moq	fakeiteasy
btw why do you want to use fakeiteasy it looks to me less powerful than moq

yes 
opcache	apc
zend opcache appears to be more performant than apc more fully featured and more reliable

yes 
client-side	server-side
i am curious to know if detecting the visitor browser with client-side script is more reliable than server-side script

yes 
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
it seems that google-chrome internet explorer or safari are more strict than firefox on terms of security

yes 
udp	tcp
+ consider that the implementation of tcp stack is much more complicated than udp more instructions are executed there
