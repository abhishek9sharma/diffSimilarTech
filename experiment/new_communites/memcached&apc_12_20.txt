quick, googling, experience, ---------------------------------------------------

quick,googling,faster
a quick googling says that apc is 5 times faster than memcached

experience,faster
my experience say that apc is nearly 7-8 times faster than memcached

slower,faster,redis
it s slower than apc but it s faster than memcached redis etc

in-memory,slower
memcached is in-memory too and a bit slower than apc

faster
in my case apc is 59 times faster than memcached

single, process, server, ---------------------------------------------------

slower,single,process
memcached around 4-5 times slower than apc but run as a single process that can be touched everywhere in my environment

faster,single,server
apc is faster on a single server - but memcached is distributed

faster,keys,single
as you know apc is much more faster than memcached if we re fetching keys from a single server

functionality,environments,single,servers
memcached has more functionality but is intended for distributed environments while apc works on single servers only

access,faster,local,network
apc access is a bit faster something like 5 times faster than memcached if i remember correctly as it s only local -- no network involved

caching, database, opcode, ---------------------------------------------------

opcode,caching,memory,database,altough
apc is more an opcode caching system than a key value memory database like memcached altough it can be greatly used for both purposes

caching,database,performance,regard
memcached is more for caching database queries and improving performance in that regard while apc is more for improving performance of php code

other---------------------------------------------------

faster,zend_cache,backend,extension,development
memcached is faster than apc as zend_cache backend but you still need apc extension installed even in development mode to get a great speedup of your code

functionality
apc gives you some more functionality than memcached

big,caveat,memory,available,though.,default,adavantage
the big caveat here is that apc generally has less memory available for storage though. default being 32mb memcached s big adavantage is that while still fast it s distributed so if you have multiple servers running they could share this data

feature,needs
apc have less feature than memcached and is easly to use and optimize but this depends on your needs

lines,object,cache,xcache,stores
memcached is more along the lines of a distributed object cache vs something like apc or xcache which stores php bytecode in memory so you avoid having to parse it each time

overhead,tcp,function,call,xcache,objects
memcached has more overhead since you have to use a tcp connection to access it versus just a function call for apc xcache shared objects

better,use,apache,server,faster,need,tcp,ip,call
better use apc on apache server it will be much faster than memcached because you don t need to make a tcp ip call to connect to memcached

mention,suitable,direct,replacement,apc_fetch,calls,faster,purpose
please don t mention memcached i am already using it but it is not suitable as direct replacement of apc because i am doing many apc_fetch calls because apc is much faster than memcached for this purpose
