other---------------------------------------------------

api,simpler
give swt a go the api is a lot simpler than swing

layuots,exact,easier
it can be hard to get the layuots exact the way you want in swt it s usually easier in swing

faster
is swt faster than swing

view,easier,experience
so in my view using swing is simply easier unless you have more experience in swt

opinion,easier,results,nicer,application,right
in my opinion swing is easier to learn and to use but the results of swt are often nicer - you can often feel that a swing application behaves not completely right

user,interface,better
in java if you want a graphic user interface you can use swt or swing and swing is better than swt

design,aspects,simpler,imo,better
even though i liked many design aspects of swt and it is simpler than swing imo swing is the one to learn because imo it has far far better documentation examples etc

faster,modern,versions,enough
swt is claimed to be faster than swing although in modern versions swing is also fast enough

slower,proxy,os
swt became slower than swing because it uses proxy to os widgets

community,smaller,tools
swt community is smaller and it doesn t provide that many tools as swing does

platform-specific,look,ships,built-in,external,libraries,use,eclipse
swt has a more platform-specific look about it but java ships with swing built-in there s no messing about with external libraries as with swt although the use of eclipse may make that much easier i still develop quite a bit of my stuff from the command line unfortunately

simple,first,ui
swt is more simple to use than swing especially if this is your first ui

bugs,harder,final,hostile,package,several,sources
fixing bugs in swt is much harder than in swing most classes in swt are final or contain hostile checks in the constructor to make sure no one extends them the package is signed so you can t simply replace classes and so far i tried several times to compile swt from sources - and failed

eager,familiar
i m not too eager for using swt though since i m more familiar with swing

uglier,api,deal,breaker
i find swt to be an uglier api than swing in general though but not really a deal breaker

weaker,gui,technologies,accessibility,rate
swing is the weaker of the gui technologies relating to accessibility in java compared to swt at any rate

newer
also swt is actually newer and more actively maintained than swing
