mobile, landscape, desktop, ---------------------------------------------------

mobile,landscape,desktop,mode,media,query,width
but then i noticed after changing a mobile to landscape it would switching back to the desktop mode due to the width of the media query being less than the screens landscape width

smaller,liquid,media,query,width
but when the screens is smaller than 900px we switching from fixed to liquid via media query switching to a liquid width will allow our images to scale down our text to wrap and a whole bunch of other great things

side,large,responsive,smaller,vertical,orientation
the panels must be side by side for a large screens but they must be responsive and as the screens gets smaller and switching to vertical orientation

size,smaller,flex-direction,figure
when the screens size is smaller i have it switching flex-direction to column which works well except i cannot figure out how to make the 2nd row trending down start where the trending up stops where ever that may be

drag, images, larger, ---------------------------------------------------

drag,images,larger
i ve already built a view that can take a drawable can use focused pinch-zoom and drag can auto-scale images can switching images dynamically and takes images larger than the screens

swipe,right,images,larger,size,height
i am using view flipper to show bunch on images like a slider where i implemented the functionality of swipe left and right to switching images now some of my images are larger than the screens size in terms of height are getting hidden

other---------------------------------------------------

longer,navbar,lines,space
when the screens resizes the longer elements in my navbar switching to two lines to take up less space

answer,different,frequent,overworld,battle,game,final
and would the answer be different in a case where screens switching is more frequent like between an overworld screens and a battle screens in a game like final fantasy or pokemon

windows,lower,normal,resolution,panel
after switching to windows 10 i ve noticed that when selecting a lower than normal screens resolution the panel fit mode will default to maintain aspect ratio meaning black bars appear

bigger,couple,full,split
when the switching gets bigger than a couple of screens full split it into functions that handle each state using a state table to look up the function directly

text,able,paging,effect,bigger
the point of such an architecture is because i have news with some text between which i want to be able to switching with paging effect but the news text can be bigger than the screens

point,nothing,longer,external,blank,sake,exercise
at this point there is nothing i can do since the switching is no longer there... the external screens is just a blank screens for the sake of the exercise

landscape,mode,listview,taller
however when i switching to landscape mode the listview is taller than the screens

framework,better,compatability,resolutions,densities
switching to 2.2 framework which has better compatability with screens resolutions and densities
