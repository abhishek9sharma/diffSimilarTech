higher, precedence, operator, ---------------------------------------------------

multiplication,higher,precedence,subtraction
to start with i need multiplication and division to take higher precedence than addition and subtraction

operator,higher,precedence,sum
the division operator has a higher precedence than the addition operator + so you need to enclose the sum with brackets before dividing

operator,higher,precendence,function
the division operator has a higher precendence than the addition operator so your function is calculating 1 1 + e -x

multiplication,higher,priority,subtraction
multiplication and division have higher priority than addition and subtraction

higher,precedence
division has higher precedence than addition

note,higher,precedence
note that division has a higher precedence than addition

multiplication,operators,higher,precedence,subtraction,scientific
multiplication and division operators have higher precedence than addition and subtraction in c++ same as in scientific notation

multiplication,higher,precedence,subtraction,extraneous
finally we all know that multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction so we can remove the extraneous parentheses so this turns into

multiplication,higher,precedence,first,implicit
multiplication and division are higher precedence than addition so they get done first - before the implicit conversion to string for concatenation

multiplication,higher,precedence,subtraction
multiplication and division have a higher precedence than addition and subtraction

operator,higher,precedence
this happens because the division operator has higher precedence than the + addition operator

higher,precedence,integer
since division has a higher precedence than addition 5 2 gets evaluated as a integer division returning 2 as an integer

higher,precedence,subtraction
division has a higher precedence than addition or subtraction so it s really this

higher,precedence,sumaverage1+,sumaverage2,integer
the division has higher precedence than the addition so what you re calculating is sumaverage1+ sumaverage2 5 which is integer division which is probably not what you want

operator,higher,order,precedence
the division operator has a higher order precedence as the addition operator

higher,precedence
division has a higher precedence than addition ergo

faster, slower, operation, ---------------------------------------------------

slower,bitwise,operation
it could be done via division which is much slower than addition or it could be translated into a bitwise and operation as well and end up being just as fast as the version

modulo,operation,slower
it is true that division and modulo a division operation is slower than addition

subtraction,okay,point,arithmetic,brackets
the addition and subtraction is okay because the types of a and b force them to be performed using floating point arithmetic - but because division binds more tightly than addition and subtraction it s like using the brackets above only the immediate operands are considered

single-precision,multiplication,longer,subtraction
the term is apparently not an exact measurement as it is clear that a double-precision floating-point operation is going to take longer than a single-precision one and multiplication and division are going to take longer than addition and subtraction

faster,multiplication
an addition is faster than a division and a multiplication

subtraction,level,logic,slower
division is performed by repeated subtraction therefore needs more level of subtract logic making division slower than addition

bit,shift,operation,slower
2.the division by 2 can be done by bit - shift operation is it really slower than addition

larger,type,faster,modulo
performing addition on this slightly larger type will pretty much always be faster than doing division or modulo on the type itself

operation,faster,gpu
i need to find out that how much division operation is faster than addition operation in a gpu

complex,slower,operations,incorrect
as far as i know the division is more complex and slower than other operations like addition so is my code incorrect then

systems,64-bit,faster,32-bit,modulo
for example on most 32 bit systems 64-bit addition is faster than 32-bit division modulo

preferable,computers,subtraction,binary,arithmetic,simpler
knuth writes that fibonacci search is preferable on some computers because it involves only addition and subtraction not division by 2. but almost all computers use binary arithmetic in which division by 2 is simpler than addition and subtraction

dependency,problems,faster
so if your code has tough data dependency problems addition is about 12 times faster than division

careful,optimization,faster
with careful optimization however you can make addition 61 times faster than division

faster
for example an addition is typically much faster than a division

time, example, cycles, ---------------------------------------------------

example,cycles,time
best example the division it an an addition are both o 1 but usually the division takes far more cycles time to execute than the addition

time
i remember it says something like division takes much much more time than addition

difference, expensive, costly, ---------------------------------------------------

first,difference,expensive
the first difference is that division is much more expensive than addition

costly,difference
generally the division is more costly than addition i think but not much difference in this case

other---------------------------------------------------

expensive,multiplication,number,operations,trial,limit,small
so even disregarding that division is more expensive than addition and multiplication we see that the number of operations the sieve requires is much smaller than the number of operations required by trial division if the limit is not too small

simulations,things,square,roots,expensive
if you are doing physical simulations things like division or square roots are going to be way more expensive than addition

work,arrays
in addition to that the crossing off may be less work than a division don t know about python it is for c arrays

larger,complexity
and division has larger complexity than addition
