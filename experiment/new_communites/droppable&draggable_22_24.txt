div, smaller, p.s, ---------------------------------------------------

bigger
this overlap is somewhat forced when the draggable is bigger than the droppable

div,bigger
the draggable div is 3 times bigger than one droppable

p.s,smaller
p.s this will only work if the draggable is smaller than droppable which is true in this case

smaller
but i have a problem dragging to a droppable that is smaller than the draggable

div
how can i make the two droppable div s to not accept more than one draggable elements

div
how can i make the droppable to not accept more than one draggable div

target,size,smaller
perhaps you find it strange since the target droppable s size is much smaller than the draggable

matter,size,big,item
it s just a hunch but maybe it s only a matter of the size of your draggable being too big and being over more than one droppable item

parent, larger, element, ---------------------------------------------------

element,margin,bigger,status,upper
it seems like the draggable element including the margin is bigger than the droppable element and therefore the dropped status is set although the element does not seems to touch the upper droppable yet

dimension,div,smaller,event
when i made dimension of draggable div smaller than droppable div then drop event triggered successfully

parent,element,wrapper,bigger,teeth
i have a draggable parent element ice cream wrapper which is bigger than the droppable one teeth

item,larger,div,appointment,box
when the draggable item is larger than the droppable div for some reason it will always place the appointment in the droppable div box that is directly below the one i am targetting

li,element,bigger,div
apparently the draggable li element is bigger than the droppable div because the li is block size and the div has a 150px width

size,div,smaller,container
and the size of the draggable div s should be smaller than the droppable div so that they fit in the droppable container

unwanted,behavior,parent,element,padding,larger,snaptolerance
i was able to remove the unwanted behavior described above by turning the droppable into the parent of the element and added a margin padding that is slightly larger than the draggable snaptolerance

ui,perspective,image,bigger,possible,container
it works nicely but from the rich ui perspective it s boring so i was wondering since the draggable image is bigger than the droppable how could i do assuming it s possible to have the droppable container suck the bigger image until if fills its dimensions

width, set, z-index, ---------------------------------------------------

full,width,container,wider
this means that your draggable is the full width of the container which is much wider than the droppable and thus can t possibly intersect by 50

set,higher,z-index,visible
for draggable set higher z-index than droppable so that draggable will always be visible over droppable

work,z-index,container
i can make this work if the z-index of the droppable is less than the container but then you can t see where the draggable is since it s hidden behind the container

width,area,set
alternatively you could set a width on your draggable which is less than twice the width of your droppable area or combine a set width with one of the above options for a better user experience

point, element, item, ---------------------------------------------------

item
the problem you outlined is that the droppable is allowing more than 1 draggable item to be placed inside of it

element,point
the draggable is covering more than one droppable element and at this point there are multiple event.target.id s being covered

other---------------------------------------------------


without draggable seems more like it but then i can t use the droppable

validation
i have a validation on the droppable for not adding more than one draggable per droppable
