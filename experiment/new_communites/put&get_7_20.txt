loop, small, assumption, ---------------------------------------------------

small,assumption,process,faster,loop,q.empty
as long as the dataframe is small your assumption that the put process is faster than the get seems true we can fetch all 5 items within one loop of while not q.empty

loop,counter,value,higher,stuck..
when i put my loop counter variable pagessent in the watch window it gets optmized when i declare as volatile it still gets optimized but when the max value is set to 4 the loop exits properly but if max value is higher than 4 get stuck..

requests, second, bucket, ---------------------------------------------------

rate,bucket,requests,second
if you expect a rapid increase in the request rate for a bucket to more than 300 put list delete requests per second or more than 800 get requests per second we recommend that you open a support case to prepare for the workload and avoid any temporary limits on your request rate

performance,considerations,requests,second
at very high speeds amazon s3 does have some recommended request rate and performance considerations but this is only when making more than 300 put list delete requests per second or more than 800 get requests per second for a particular bucket

rate,bucket,requests,second
i m not sure if this is the answer but states that if you expect a rapid increase in the request rate for a bucket to more than 300 put list delete requests per second or more than 800 get requests per second we recommend that you open a support case to prepare for the workload and avoid any temporary limits on your request rate

slower, rate, ---------------------------------------------------

rate,slower
at times the get rate is slower than the put rate and we see messages backing up

slower
this could mean that put is now slower than get and we have to wait

other---------------------------------------------------

topological,sort,value,number,vertices
this should be producing a topological sort but so far i consistently get one value less than i put in as far as number of vertices and none of the number match those i ve inputted

user-agents,post,difficult,different,users
from an interface design standpoint you want user-agents to make post and put and delete more difficult than get or at least distinctly different so that users can rely on that difference to hint when their actions might cause a change in the resource state because they are responsible for those changes

mechanisms,database,slower,data,http
since most data-storage mechanisms in-ram in a database etc. get a lot slower as you put more data in them you should ensure you re only timing your http access and not looking at overall crawler throughput including storage

method,better,webservice
right now i would have to say the put method is better since it works and i could not get the webservice to work

slider,work,better,slider.js,chrome
but the slider won t work well it doesn t get activated is a better way to put it if i insert the code from slider.js into the chrome console hit enter - booom works perfectly i ve been looking for what the problem might be tried adding the type text javascript in the script tags added the document .ready in my jquery still nothing.

wrong,session,login,oswap,privilege,level
now don t get me wrong regenerating the session id on login or more accurately as oswap put it on privilege level change is indeed a very good defense against session fixation

worse,tests,specflow
i m concerned this is going to get worse as we put more tests into the specflow project

count,number,sequence,different,series
from the count you will get the number of sequence and those which have more than 2 put those in a different series and then add that series in the dataframe

functions,data
and then i saw that they put functions under transform that did much more than just get data

large,file,command,slower
as i am benchmarking my cluster i discover that for large file my get command is actually slower than put command

loop
to get your code to run more than once put it in a while loop

cache,slower,native,inbuilt,value
i think put and get on ignite cache would likely to be slower than native put and get on my inbuilt key value store

frequent
you got at least put and delete although they are used much less frequent than get and post as in hardly ever
