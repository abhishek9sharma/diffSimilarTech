important, alot, shorter, ---------------------------------------------------

important,alot,shorter,easier,humans
one important reason is because hex is alot shorter and easier to read than binary is for humans

human,looks,editor,easier
but when anyone human looks at it they look at it in hex using a hex editor which is much easier than reading binary

decimal, representation, head, ---------------------------------------------------

decimal,easier,head,first,representation,number
converting between decimal and hex is more involving and at least to me it s been easier if i have to do it in my head to first convert the decimal into binary representation and then the binary number into hex

usability,standpoint,representation,better,numbers
it seems the from a readability and usability standpoint the hex representation is a better way of defining binary numbers

width,characters,conversion,faster,decimal
this is still accepted by calls like inet_addr and has several advantages all fields are fixed width there are only 8 characters to update and the binary to hex conversion is usually faster than binary to decimal

digit, simpler, corresponding, ---------------------------------------------------

conversion,simpler,digit,corresponding,0xa4
the conversion from hex to binary is even simpler since you can simply expand each hex digit into the corresponding binary for example 0xa4 - 1010 0100

convenient,digit,0-f,groups,bits,single
as others have pointed out hex is much more convenient than binary anyway - you just need to remember how each of the hex digit 0-f looks in binary and replace groups of 4 bits with a single hex digit

readable, useful, data, ---------------------------------------------------

readable,useful
and because hex is much more readable and useful than binary - it s often used and shown

readable,data,dump
hex is somewhat more readable than binary if i happen to be loading a data dump in a text editor etc

other---------------------------------------------------

easier,heads,numbers,blocks,size,byte,digits,notation,clunky
hex is easier for most people to convert to and from binary in their heads since binary numbers are usually expressed in blocks of eight because that s the size of a byte and eight is exactly two hex digits but hex notation would have been clunky and misleading in dennis time implying the ability to address 16 bits

memory,command,easier,solution
- i usually find debugging memory in hex x command is easier than binary so i will not use my solution

right,side,greater,equal,false
if the right side the binary side is greater than or equal to the hex side then you print true if not then you print false

format_int,loops,dec
format_int in binary case it loops 4 times then 4 times more than hex and dec cases

string,longer,corresponding
a hex string is significantly longer than the corresponding binary string

data,editing,paint.net,friendlier,editors
i ve been using images to store data since editing binary data through paint.net is much friendlier than most hex editors

instances,arbitrary,data,text,overhead,better,notation
base64 is usually used in instances to represent arbitrary binary data in a text format it has a 33.3 overhead but that s better than say hex notation which has a 50 overhead

verbose,number
hex is just less verbose and can express anything a binary number can

encoding,readable,sublime,uses
hex encoding is far more readable than binary that s why sublime uses it

space,longer,records,straight,method
unfortunately using hex consumes way more space and takes significantly longer i m dealing with 500gb of data and around 1 2 million records so i would really like to get the straight binary method to work

values,odd,standard,prefix,numbers,larger,magnitude,representation
those hex values seem a bit odd they re powers of two in decimal but in any case 0x128 the 0x is a standard prefix for hex numbers is the larger of the numbers in magnitude and its binary representation is 100101000
