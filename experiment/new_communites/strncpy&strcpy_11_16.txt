unsafe, cousins, strcpy_s, ---------------------------------------------------

unsafe,cousins,strcpy_s,safer
strcpy is notoriously unsafe as are it s cousins strcpy_s and strncpy although they are mildly safer than strcpy

safer,type,bugs
strncpy is not safer than strcpy it just trades one type of bugs with another

myth,safer,version
myth 3 strncpy is a safer version of strcpy

string, array, additional, ---------------------------------------------------

safer,string,array
you should use strcpy or strncpy safer than strcpy to copy the string stored in the array between arrays

safer,additional,parameter
i was exploring around with c regarding strncpy since most people says that it is safer than strcpy additional parameter length to avoid buffer overflows

safer,method
strncpy is not safer method to use as strcpy

safer,alternative
in general strncpy is a safer alternative to strcpy

safer
strncpy is safer than strcpy

better, things, strlcpy, ---------------------------------------------------

better,things,strlcpy
using strncpy 3 is better than strcpy 3 but things like strlcpy 3 are better still

better,checking
strcpy could be better replaced by strncpy which does some bound checking

i.e,better,simpler,willing
i.e strncpy is actually better than the simpler strcpy if you are willing to improve the code

other---------------------------------------------------

buffer,overflow
strncpy is more recommended that strcpy because protect your code against buffer overflow

safier,second,one
using strncpy is considered safier than strcpy because the second one can easily cause buffer overrun

secure
so that the strncpy is more secure than strcpy

instance,useless,nothing
for instance strncpy is mostly useless it gives you nothing more than strcpy

custom,version,weird,length,input
the best solution is to write a custom version of strncpy that is less weird or if you know the length of the input just use strcpy
