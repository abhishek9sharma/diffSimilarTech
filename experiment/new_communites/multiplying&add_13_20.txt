precedence, higher, pow, ---------------------------------------------------

extra,braces,higher,precedence,percentage,discounts
with extra braces because multiplying has a higher precedence than add - assuming these are both percentage discounts

pow,evaluator,higher,precedence,divide
moreover i would like to add the pow in my evaluator with an higher precedence than multiplying and divide

pow,evaluator,higher,precedence,divide
i would like to add the pow in my evaluator with an higher precedence than multiplying and divide

someone,behaviour,operator,higher,precedence
can someone explain this behaviour multiplying operator has higher precedence than add operator

exprbinopmul,precedence,higher,proper,consideration
in the above example the instance of exprbinopadd is a child of the instance of exprbinopmul although precedence of multiplying is higher than precedence of add which results from the proper consideration of the parentheses

precedence,left-to-right,instruction,level
then i think it would be the problem of precedence in most case they are left-to-right and i think multiplying would be calculated first because in c multiplying is more prior than add instruction by one level

clock, cycles, operation, ---------------------------------------------------

operation,clock,cycles,processors
the multiplying operation uses more clock cycles than the add on many processors

faster,clock,cycles,verses,particular,cpu
however multiplying is faster than adding even though less clock cycles are used to add verses multiplying according to what my particular cpu s datasheet says about the instructions being used

higher, lower, resolutions, ---------------------------------------------------

higher,lower,resolutions
you can add higher and lower resolutions by multiplying or dividing them by 2

divide,higher,precedence
multiplying and divide have higher precedence than add and subtract

higher,precedence,example,john
to give multiplying and divide higher precedence than add and subtract you can do something like this example adapted from john levine lex yacc 2 e 1992

slower, years, ---------------------------------------------------

slower
its the multiplying that historically was slower than the add

years,slower
as of a few years ago multiplying was 3x slower than add

other---------------------------------------------------

fast,multiplier,order,slower,normal,hardware
on a cpu with a fast multiplier multiplying may only be on the order of 4 times slower than add but on normal hardware it s 16-32 times slower for a 32 bit operation

fp,throughput,lower,fma,intel,skylake
for example fp add throughput is lower than fma or multiplying on intel before skylake 1 vector per clock instead of 2

sub,cheaper,better,throughput
add sub are cheaper than multiplying better throughput and lower latency

faster,mul,general,values,loop,operations
add is faster than mul but if you want to multiplying two general values mul is far faster than any loop iterating add operations


where multiplying binds more tightly than add

expensive,modern,computers
multiplying is still somewhat more expensive than add on modern computers and compilers go to some effort to replace them with one or two shifts+add instructions

time,addition,step
functionally a multiplying will always take more time than an add because it combines a true multiplying along with a true addition step
