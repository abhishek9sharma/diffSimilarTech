slower, current, requirements, ---------------------------------------------------

slower,current,requirements
des turned out to be even slower than aes but for my current requirements a much simpler algorythm rc4 is sufficient

slower,modern,hardware
des is usually substantially slower than aes on modern hardware and has keys that are far too short for modern use

faster, timings, sensitive, ---------------------------------------------------

timings,sensitive,faster
this shows that the timings are sensitive to buffering and that aes is faster than des

faster,3des,default
if aes is negotiated it s faster than des and 3des used by default by older applications

little,faster,smaller
using des assuming it s a little faster than aes and requires a smaller key and

faster,cpu,aes-ni
aes can be even much faster than des or 3des when the cpu supports aes-ni

faster,result
aes will indeed yield a considerably faster result than des

size, triple, effective, ---------------------------------------------------

effective,size,larger,triple
note that the effective key size of aes is larger than triple des

secure,triple,example
i ve read that aes encryption is more secure than the triple des encryption ms is using in their example above

analysis,rijndael-128,fast,bigger,size
according to this analysis aes rijndael-128 is more than twice as fast as des 3des with a bigger key size more secure

other---------------------------------------------------

unrelated,actual,slower,small,better
though it s unrelated to your actual question des is generally slower than aes at least in software so unless you really need to keep the key small aes is almost certainly a better choice

hardware,failure,power,ones,antenna
turns out this was a hardware failure the aes commands need more power than the des crypto1 ones 50 more which the antenna failed to deliver at the reading range i was testing with

steps,vulnerable
which steps of aes encryption makes it less vulnerable than des

3des,better,sense,secure,performance,necessity,worse
edit 3des is better than des in the sense that it s significantly more secure but still less secure than aes but its performance is of necessity significantly worse than aes des or twofish because you re essentially applying des three times

secure
also see why aes is more secure than des

better,speedup,observations
if you used aes then you might see a better speedup over the des 3des observations
