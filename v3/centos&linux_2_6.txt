outputs, verison, sudo, ---------------------------------------------------

distributions,older,root,user,verison,sudo
some of linux distributions use older python version for root user like centos .if the python verison you re running with sudo isn t correct you can t access those modules installed by pip

distributions,older,root,user,look,outputs
some of linux distributions use older python version for root user like centos .have a look at the outputs of which python and sudo which python you ll see they might be different

others---------------------------------------------------

red,hat-based,distros,fedora,simpler
the pattern-based version installed by default on red hat-based linux distros fedora centos etc is simpler

particular,amazon,things,worse
also very particular that this should be done on centos or amazon linux which makes things worse for me as i have been on ubuntu for long

alpine,docker,image,better,ubuntu
you can use alpine linux docker image it is very light and is better than both ubuntu and centos image to be used as the docker

process,distro,report
one one ubuntu distro fuser -n tcp 3000 will report a process if i own the process yet on another linux distro i think centos it won t report the process even if i own it
