recoverable, addition, unrecoverable, ---------------------------------------------------

recoverable,unrecoverable,md5,better
my sense is that encode and decode are probably good solutions when you want the data to be recoverable but that unrecoverable hash using crypt md5 is a better approach for stored passwords

addition,password,better
in addition using crypt to hash password is better

others---------------------------------------------------

newer,alogrithms
hash is newer and seems to support more hashing alogrithms than crypt

nothing,salt,earlier
that accepts either nothing a salt or a hash that crypt made earlier which has the salt to make the hash embedded in it

second,function,variants
the second hashing function is hash which supports many more algorithms and variants than crypt but does not support some algorithms that crypt does

expensive,md5
crypt with hash is simply more expensive than md5

llvm,gcc,fuction,junk,proven,breakable,worse
mac os x llvm gcc based crypt fuction is borked junk hardwired to only use des a proven breakable hash worse than md5

salt,password,secure,output,hackers,passwords
so when i see that the salt is stored in the hash password and that you use that hash password as salt i think crypt + salt is not more secure against a brute force on output hackers who managed to steal hash passwords
