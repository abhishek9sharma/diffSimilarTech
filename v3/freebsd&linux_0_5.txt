containers,jails,better
linux containers and freebsd jails are a better alternative to chroot

bourne,shell,capable
be aware that the bourne shell in freebsd is more capable than on linux

stable,least,release,s11e
i d expect that freebsd would be more stable least changing from release to release than either linux or s11e

flag,available,cygwin,macos,x,netbsd,better
tail -f that is capital -f as opposed to lowercase -f is a non-standard flag available on linux cygwin macos x freebsd and netbsd that works better for watching log files which may be rotated occasionally

personal,experience,better,low-end,hardware,modern,distro
just a tip but from personal experience i ve found that freebsd works much better on low-end hardware than a modern linux distro does
