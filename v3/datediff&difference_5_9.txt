greater, period, dates, ---------------------------------------------------

narrow,period,days
generally you can use datediff to specify more narrow period if you would like this difference to be less than 10 days you could use

dates,greater,days
how to calculate datediff between two dates if difference is greater than 35 days

end, difficult, minutes, ---------------------------------------------------

end,time,hour,actual,minutes
for example if the start time was 8 55 and the end time 9 05 datediff hour ... would return 1 although the actual difference is much less just 10 minutes

difficult,dateparts,minutes,seconds
datediff becomes more difficult to use as you have more dateparts in your difference in your case looks like minutes and seconds

others---------------------------------------------------

diffseconds,overflow,larger,int32.maxvalue,error,function
note that diffseconds can cause an overflow when the difference becomes larger than int32.maxvalue error the datediff function resulted in an overflow

statement,flag,new,login,greater,threshold
you can then add datediff and a case statement to flag a new login where the difference is greater than your threshold

datepart,better,month
for me testing with a data set of 2508 records with dates evenly spread through a single year and joining the table to itself datepart performed significantly better than datediff the difference between datepart and month was negligable though datepart was typically 1ms faster

column,date,lines
you can use datediff between the column date and your current date and retrieve only the lines where the difference is less than 7 like

method,b,dates,output,time,day
i ve using the datediff method to get the difference b w two dates obtained using the date yyyy mm dd hh mm ss function but getting the output 0 every time even when the difference is more than 1 day
