closer,form,simple,index
it would be slightly more sensible to bind the click to an element closer to the form and if you use getelementbyid rather than getelementsbytagname it s more simple since you don t have to worry about the index of the number you re binding to

different,element
getelementsbytagname is slightly different from getelementbyid as getelementbyid will only return one element if it exists whereas getelementsbytagname can return more than one element
