division, faster, operation, ---------------------------------------------------

non-mathematical,symbols,probabilities,symbol,likely
feel free to use non-mathematical symbols for this but since you re basically multiplying probabilities the multiplication symbol seemed more likely to give an intuitive idea for what is going on than incorporateprobability or somesuch.

number,power,operation,faster
mathematically left shifting is the same as multiplying a number by a power of 2 but as the operation is done only by shifting it is much faster than doing multiplication

note,dshin,faster,division,binary,search
note that i ve incorporated dshin s comment that multiplying is faster than division however the performance improvement is about 90 removing the binary search 10 multiplication vs

easier,shl,operation,operand
implementing multiplication is easier if you remember an shl operation performs the same operation as multiplying the specified operand by two

variable,likely,faster,logic
if you re dividing or multiplying by a variable then it s likely that multiplication is slightly faster because the logic is generally more simple

mistake,number,compiler,optimization,longer
if i make a mistake and multiplying a number by 1.0 instead of 1 and i do not use any compiler optimization then my multiplication will last much longer than multiplying a number by 1

programming,practice,floating-point,representation,ï,faster,division
in usual programming practice one wouldn t bother and simply multiplying by the floating-point representation of 180 ï because multiplication is so much faster than division

division,faster,inverse
i believe that division would be faster than multiplying by the inverse since the inverse has to be calculated first then multiplication performed

shifts,faster,b,compiler,best
the code is written like this in the belief that a shifts and adds are significantly faster than multiplication and b the compiler doesn t know the best way to multiplying by ten

values, possibility, int, ---------------------------------------------------

possibility,values,result,approach,slower,processor,cycles
another possibility would be to multiplying the values and check if the result is equal to 0 but this approach is probably a lot slower since multiplication takes usually more processor cycles than comparing values and or ing them

double,values,kids.size,size,great,possibility,result,int
math.random returns double values between 0.0 and 1.0 so even when you are multiplying it with kids.size if size is 1000 there is a great possibility that the multiplication result is still less than 1 and so converting to int would return 0

divide, numbers, zeros, ---------------------------------------------------

width,height,constant,result
you have to multiplying both the width and the height by a constant and the scaled result of the multiplication should be less than 16777215

first,lines,matrix,numbers
perhaps it s also relevant that the first three lines of the posted code multiplying matrix elements repeatedly since repeated multiplication can generate numbers less than 1 as well

use,divide,faster
and don t use divide where multiplying will do multiplication is typically faster though not always

overflow,last,new,bits,easier
after analysing your code there is a final unsigned 32 bit integer overflow in the last multiplication by 10 you multiplying by 10 not by 2 so you can get up to four new bits in each multiplication making it easier for an overflow even if you do unsigned arithmetic which is recommended so you don t need to play with the signs

easier,tasks,number,zeros
multiplication is the easier of the tasks just remember to multiplying each block of one number with the other and carry the zeros

harder,numbers,divide
multiplication is slightly harder just multiplying two scaled numbers and then divide by your scale factor

first,simpler,integer,result,overflow
multiplying first is probably simpler than using floating point if you only want an integer result and if you know that the multiplication will never overflow

line,divide,result,zeros
so the bottom line is after every divide do the multiplying the 5 with 5 and if the result of multiplication is less than the equals to n then divide the n with result and add the zeros counter variable

higher, precedence, numeric, ---------------------------------------------------

higher,precedence,digit,character
since multiplication has a higher precedence than subtraction you should subtract 0 to your digit character before multiplying it

numeric,expression,higher,precedence
either way your example with the numeric expression would multiplying by 3 first because multiplication has higher precedence than addition or subtraction

others---------------------------------------------------

number,neutral,point,series,fixed
if you start with zero and multiplying it by whatever number s it stays zero -- it s not a neutral starting point for a series of multiplication it s more of a fixed point a black hole in a sense

operator,suitable,api,matrices
there just isn t a lot you can do about this other than not using operator at all to do your multiplication and find a more suitable api to multiplying your matrices

better,couple,bit-shifted,single,running,illustrate,statistical
still while it might be better than multiplying by say 17 16+1 or 12 8+4 as they only add in a couple bit-shifted copies of the original value instead of five it s a very weak hash compared to hash functions that do more than a single running multiplication and i ll illustrate that using some statistical analysis.

complex,integer,scale,scaleback
multiplication is slightly more complex as it needs an integer multiplying followed by a scale back such as 0.72 2 becomes 72 200 becomes 14400 becomes 144 scaleback becomes 1.44

operations,jit,opcodes,relationship,cycles,faster,addition,clock,clocks
in the remote case those operations are not simplified assuming that there is a jit that maps the multiplication and add opcodes in a 1 1 relationship to their cpu instruction counterparts in most modern architectures all integer arithmetic operations usually take the same number of cycles so it will be faster multiplying once than add four times just checked it addition is still slightly faster than multiplication 1 clock vs 3 clocks so it still pays using a multiplication here

shift,faster,loop,cost,check,simple,integer
while it is true that a simple shift or add is often faster than a multiplication but not always â multiplication are faster than you might think the only way you could use it here inside the loop is if you first checked to see that you were supposed to be multiplying by 2 and the cost of doing that check more specifically the cost of making the decision as a result of that check is far more costly than a simple integer multiplication

values,careful,overflow,wider,type,point,smaller,factors
note that for large values you ll need to be careful that the multiplication doesn t overflow - perhaps by converting to a wider type or to floating point or by carefully multiplying and dividing by smaller factors

matrix,easier,several,implementations,method,packages
matrix multiplication is the easier one there are several matrix implementations with a multiplying method in packages org.apache.spark.mllib.linalg and org.apache.spark.mllib.linalg.distributed

autojit,compiler,0s,matrix,1s,actual,part,summation,slower,final,answer
the autojit compiler realizes you re multiplying by all 0s and removes the matrix multiplication completely and simply returns a matrix of all 0s in the 1s it skips the actual multiplication part and just does the summation part of a matrix multiplication which is slightly slower than just returning all 0s finally the final one actually forces the compiler to have to do a matrix multiplication since it can t assume the answer

last,work,previous,multiplies
the reason for this intuitively is that the last multiplication does dramatically more work than any of the previous multiplication so much so in fact that summing up the work of all the preceding multiplies gives something asymptotically dominated by the last multiplying

chain,cost,greater,matrix-vector,cheaper,matrix-matrix
this is not true for matrix chain the cost of multiplying 100 100 100 100 is much greater than 100 100 100 100 100 1 because two matrix-vector multiplication is much cheaper than a matrix-matrix

value,runtime,canbe,faster,instruction,support,processors,risc,complex,operations,proper
if 50 is replaced by x a value known only at runtime there will be a multiplication before the add the multiplication canbe optimised into a faster operation if the multiplicand is simple enough as one instruction because there is support to multiplying by 1 2 4 8 and 16 - at least in some processors and even risc processors multiplication is often more complex than a few add and shift operations - small numbers are often very easy to deal with this way but 575 or 13412 may not be so easy to convert to a small number of simple operations so a proper multiplication will be needed

division,complicated,helper,functions,64-bit,numbers
multiplication and division are much more complicated and the compiler usually produces some small helper functions to deal with these whenever you multiplying 64-bit numbers together

bit,application,numbers,additions
in a 64 bit application this code will be a lot faster than in a 32 bit application in a 32 bit application multiplying two 64 bit numbers take 3 multiplication and 3 additions on 32 bit values - however it might be still faster than a division on a 32 bit machine

operation,costly,things,program,replacement,integer,number
since bit-shifting operation is typically less costly than multiplication to speed things up you will see in some program people use left bit-shift operation as a replacement of multiplication when they mean to multiplying it by an integer number of power of 2 that is 2 4 8 16 etc

thing,couple,num1,num2,function,addition,better
since you want to do same thing couple times writing your multiplication num1 num2 function yourself with only addition and using that when multiplying would be much better choice
