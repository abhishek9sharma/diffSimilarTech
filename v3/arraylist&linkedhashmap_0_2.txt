test,hashmap,treemap,slower,ability,submaps
after a few test hashmap linkedhashmap and treemap are way slower than arraylist and i wanted to use them just for the ability to create submaps

hashmaps,final
it gives me arraylist but arraylist has a linkedhashmap which contains some more linked hashmaps containing final values
