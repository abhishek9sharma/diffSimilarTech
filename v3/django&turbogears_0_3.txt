stronger,support
as well for all i know turbogears 2 or django have stronger support for exposing web services out of the box.

active,tag,overflow,pylons,easier
compare the very active django tag on stack overflow with that of pylons or turbogears though and i d argue getting started is simply easier with django irrespective of anything to do with code

month,similar
web2py may be young but the mailing list has 2000 messages month which is similar to django and far more than turbogears
