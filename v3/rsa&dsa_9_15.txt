equivalent, security, 1024-bit, ---------------------------------------------------

signature,part,ecdsa,shorter,signatures,bits,security,equivalent,1024-bit
for the signature part you may want to use dsa or ecdsa they yield much shorter signatures typically 320 bits for a dsa signature of security equivalent to a 1024-bit rsa signature

signature,independent,strength,smaller,equivalent,security
dsa has signature that is independent of key strength and is much smaller than rsa signature for equivalent security rsa 1024 1568 vs dsa 192

greater, ones, shorter, ---------------------------------------------------

ecdsa,shorter,greater,strength
dsa and ecdsa both produce shorter signatures with much greater strength that rsa

signatures,shorter,ones
dsa signatures are signficantly shorter than rsa ones

slower, testing, ---------------------------------------------------

slower
this is why rsa is much slower than dsa

testing,slower
i have made some testing and it came out that rsa is lot slower than dsa

faster, generation, expensive, ---------------------------------------------------

signature,generation,faster
a dsa signature generation could be somewhat faster than a rsa signature generation maybe up to twice faster

faster,client,pair,signature,verification,fast,expensive,generation
the third operation is made much faster is the client uses a rsa key pair rsa signature verification is very fast whereas dsa signature verification is expensive actually somewhat more expensive than dsa signature generation

others---------------------------------------------------

compact
use dsa it tends to be more compact than rsa

bigger,deal
i ve already done the rsa but dsa is bigger deal to me

better,breadth
rsa is also a better choice than dsa because it has much better breadth of support for signatures still considered secure by nist

older,newer
i guess rsa is older and dsa is newer

size
however in this case dsa key size is less than rsa key size

field,elgamal,keys,riskier,1024-bit,successful,attack
that continued usage of 1024-bit prime field elgamal or dsa keys is much riskier than it is for 1024-bit rsa all are still commonly used because once a successful attack has been conducted against a single well-chosen prime field all users of that prime field may be affected at little additional effort.

verification,10x,slower
however dsa verification expect verification calls to be 100x issue is about 10x slower than rsa verification
