slower, performance, suspicious, ---------------------------------------------------

suspicious,performance,division,slower,operations
i am a bit suspicious of the performance because modulo tends to use division which is slower than your subtraction operations

multiplication,division,slower,integer,addition
integer multiplication division and modulo are much slower than integer addition and subtraction

binary, equivalent, negative, ---------------------------------------------------

negative,higher,binary,calculation,equivalent
with regard to implementation it also takes advantage of a bit of a non-obvious property of r precedence rules actually this is true of other languages as well such as c c++ and java namely that unary negative is higher than modulo which is higher than binary subtraction thus the calculation for is equivalent to

multiplication,division,precedence,higher,addition
multiplication division and modulo have the same precedence and they all have higher precedence than addition and subtraction

higher,precedence,addition
and keep in mind that the modulo has a higher precedence than addition and subtraction

others---------------------------------------------------

conditional,test,expensive,sum,mod
the conditional test and subtraction is typically less expensive than a modulo especially if the sum does not frequently exceed mod

order,magnitude,slower
as you can see modulo is about an order of magnitude slower than subtraction

special,faster,division-based
that is essentially the one case in which repeated subtraction 0 or 1 times a special case of repeated subtraction can be and commonly is but not necessarily faster than division-based modulo

speed,environment,expensive,simple,benchmark,certain
as i said this may increase the speed especially in an environment where modulo is more expensive than simple subtraction but you would want to actually benchmark it to be certain

slower
the reason is that the modulo is slower than subtraction
