multiple, alternative, use, ---------------------------------------------------

mouseleave,work,better
it should also be noted that mouseenter and mouseleave work somewhat differently and usually much better than mouseover and mouseout

mouseleave,reliable
imho mouseenter and mouseleave are much more reliable than mouseover and mouseout which tend to flicker

events,multiple,better
mouseover events can occur multiple times so mouseenter is a better option for this

mouseleave,better,behaviour
in this case mouseenter mouseleave has better behaviour and prevents bubbling compared to mouseover mouseout

idea,mouseleave,better,alternative
i have no idea about the classes but i think mouseenter and mouseleave are better alternative for mouseout and mouseover

use,mouseleave
because jquery doesn t use mouseover and mouseout it uses mouseenter and mouseleave which are more suited to this scenario

mouseleave,reliable
also you might want to use mouseenter and mouseleave which are sanitized by jquery and are a little more reliable than mouseover and mouseout

mouseup,mousedown,mouseleave
this may make for various race conditions and may necessitate using events which give you earlier notification than mouseup mousedown mouseenter mouseleave mouseover mouseout

better,ones,.hover,method
also instead of mouseover and mouseout use the better ones mouseenter and mouseleave or simply the .hover method

others---------------------------------------------------

event,better
the mouseenter event is usually a better choice than mouseover

slow,row,picture,faster,hope
i have a problem with my code i already make a code with mouseover but it was very slow to display per row my picture edit so i read that mouseenter is faster i hope because i have normaly 2000 row
