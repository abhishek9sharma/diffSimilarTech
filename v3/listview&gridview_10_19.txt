control, display, finer, ---------------------------------------------------

finer,control,display
i believe gridview allows much finer grained control of display than does listview

rows,possible,control,better
templating rows like this is possible in a gridview but the listview control is much better suited to this type of data

control,table
i m trying to convert a gridview to a listview to allow me more control over the table display

article,control,better,fit
here s another article that describes the listview control and why it s probably a better fit than the gridview

control,table,better,simple,tables
if you have scenarios where you need more control over how the table is rendered the listview would be better choice but based on what you said simple tables i would recommend the gridview

layout,asp,better
it will produce the desired layout with a gridview but indeed the asp listview is a better choice

better,dataview,clean
listview much better than the gridview dataview in that they let you write out clean html

better,situation
i think the listview is better than gridview in this situation

easier, better, ---------------------------------------------------

easier
you may also consider using a listview which is easier to customize than the gridview

better
i think using a gridview is better for your case than a listview

others---------------------------------------------------

item,width,screen,size,wider,content
by using a gridview with an item width as wide as the screen size 320 you can get it to behave like a listview and if the gridview get s wider the content will automatically produce two columns for you

note,view,property,designer
note that i do not want to bind a gridview directly to the view property from a resourcedictionary where the datatemplates x shared attribute is set to false as this leads to problems in the xaml designer view can t be shared by more than one listview

error
the error is because the gridview is being applied to more than one listview

useful
but don t know if listview or a gridview could be more useful for what i need

able,time,easier
i wasn t able to find out how to do it and since i didn t have more time i decided to go with a listview and a gridview which was actually easier to achieve

powerful,present,tabular,information,controls,complicated
basically gridview are the most powerful way to present tabular information whereas listview controls are for more complicated displays of repeated data

headerview,change,content,height,changes,part,new,content.i,invalidate,work.in,button,adapter,call,geidview.getheight
i add a gridview as headerview of listview when i change gridview s content it s height does t changes i can only see a part of gridview s new content.i have tried invalidate but it does t work.in the gridview i click the more button and then change the adapter of gridview but i can see only a part of new content of gridview and when i call geidview.getheight it does t change

scrolling,faster
i tried replacing the gridview with a listview and the scrolling of the listview is much faster

sneaky,suspicion,view,property,related,first
i have a sneaky suspicion that listview its view property and the gridview are more closely related than it would appear at first glance and achieving my goal may not be possible in any practical sense but this is just a hunch
