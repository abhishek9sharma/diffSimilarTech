actual,trickier,business,ntfs,ext3,nfs
actual mounting of filesystems is trickier business and really depends on what you are mounting - ntfs fat ext3 xfs nfs cifs webdav etc etc

likely,fat32,permission
since the filesystems is more than likely fat or fat32 protecting it permission based way would be more convoluted

easier,first
granted fat is an easier problem but they claim to support many filesystems and it would be my first choice

documentation,maximum,file,size,modern,low,limits,4gb,old,longer,use
i d suggest to check the documentation of your filesystems regarding maximum file size but most modern filesystems don t have such low limits that 2gb 4gb applies to fat and some other old filesystems that are no longer broadly in use on servers

larger,files,notable,exception
as far as i know almost all filesystems support larger files than that a notable exception is of course fat 32

modern,complex,difficulty,implementation
most modern filesystems are also considerably more complex than fat which would add further difficulty to the implementation
