able
once you have this you should be able to have more than one sqldatareader shared on the same sqlconnection in your code and use them independently of one another

exception,cause,earlier,program
the exception may be thrown from the code you are displaying but i would suspect that the cause is because of an sqldatareader associated with the same sqlconnection used earlier in the program execution that has not been disposed
