differences,faster
and how do the differences make liblinear faster than libsvm

faster,linear,large,scale
liblinear is considered faster than linear libsvm and often used for large scale data set

faster,memory,efficient,tasks,classifier,accord
and i ve read that using liblinear is far faster more memory efficient for such tasks as such i ve ported my libsvm classifier to accord net like so

sklearn.linear_model.logisticregression,scalable,memory,efficients
you can also try sklearn.linear_model.logisticregression and sklearn.svm.linearsvc both implemented using liblinear that is more scalable than libsvm albeit less memory efficients than other linear models in scikit-learn
