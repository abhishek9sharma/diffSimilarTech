correlation,statistical,analysis,luck,seaborn
for heatmap and correlation statistical analysis based plot i have had more luck with seaborn than with matplotlib

points,visual
i success in plotting distance with points but i need more visual plot with heatmap

data,worse,large
i tried to do this with a heatmap but the data plot was worse that way due to the large gaps between samples

note,image,latter,offsets,difficult,text
note that this relies on image rather than heatmap as the latter offsets the plot making it more difficult to put text in the correct position

mode,typical
it also allows you to use an interpolated shading mode which will make your plot look more like a typical heatmap
