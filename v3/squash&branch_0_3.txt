if you really need to be the only one to whom your work-in-progress history is visible you could create a local branch pointed at the head of your local work-in-progress to preserve a named reference to the commit and then perform a squash merge git merge --squash which will still create a merge commit but will collapse your work-in-progress commits down to a single commit the local branch you created earlier will still point to the true detailed history however

issue,simpler,git
if you will have only yours commits on your branch issue is much simpler you can do squash those git squash
