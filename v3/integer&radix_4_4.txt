equal, decimal, value, ---------------------------------------------------

string,decimal,equal,value,base
integer.parseint takes string as a signed decimal integer and that integer must be less than and not equal radix value base

search,tree,hash,string
a radix search tree trie might be more suitable than a hash if you re mapping from string to integer

others---------------------------------------------------

sort,algorithm,better
if this is not the case a standard comparison-based sort algorithm or even an integer sorting algorithm like radix sort is asymptotically better

sort,longest,shorter,array
so when using radix sort make sure the longest integer is shorter than the array size or vice versa
