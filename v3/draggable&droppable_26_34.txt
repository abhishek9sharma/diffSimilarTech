div, bigger, width, ---------------------------------------------------

parent,element,wrapper,bigger,teeth
i have a draggable parent element ice cream wrapper which is bigger than the droppable one teeth

div,color,width,height,bigger
i want when draggable div dragged into droppable div the droppable div color get another color then draggable div width height get bigger and exactly fit to droppable div

item,larger,div,appointment,box
when the draggable item is larger than the droppable div for some reason it will always place the appointment in the droppable div box that is directly below the one i am targetting

div
how can i make the droppable to not accept more than one draggable div

dimension,div,smaller,event
when i made dimension of draggable div smaller than droppable div then drop event triggered successfully

div
how can i make the two droppable div s to not accept more than one draggable elements

ui,perspective,image,bigger,possible,container
it works nicely but from the rich ui perspective it s boring so i was wondering since the draggable image is bigger than the droppable how could i do assuming it s possible to have the droppable container suck the bigger image until if fills its dimensions

size,div,smaller,container
and the size of the draggable div s should be smaller than the droppable div so that they fit in the droppable container

p.s,smaller
p.s this will only work if the draggable is smaller than droppable which is true in this case

full,width,container,wider
this means that your draggable is the full width of the container which is much wider than the droppable and thus can t possibly intersect by 50

smaller
but i have a problem dragging to a droppable that is smaller than the draggable

element,margin,bigger,status,upper
it seems like the draggable element including the margin is bigger than the droppable element and therefore the dropped status is set although the element does not seems to touch the upper droppable yet

width,element,greater,placeholder
as the width of the draggable element is greater than the placeholder i can t get the placeholder to accept the draggable element to be droppable

div,bigger
the draggable div is 3 times bigger than one droppable

width,area,set
alternatively you could set a width on your draggable which is less than twice the width of your droppable area or combine a set width with one of the above options for a better user experience

li,element,bigger,div
apparently the draggable li element is bigger than the droppable div because the li is block size and the div has a 150px width

width,wider,double
because you have not set a width on your draggable they are much wider than double your droppable width

bigger
this overlap is somewhat forced when the draggable is bigger than the droppable

div,greater,height,width
the draggable div is greater in height and width than droppable div

target,size,smaller
perhaps you find it strange since the target droppable s size is much smaller than the draggable

matter,size,big,item
it s just a hunch but maybe it s only a matter of the size of your draggable being too big and being over more than one droppable item

z-index, visible, higher, ---------------------------------------------------

work,z-index,container
i can make this work if the z-index of the droppable is less than the container but then you can t see where the draggable is since it s hidden behind the container

set,higher,z-index,visible
for draggable set higher z-index than droppable so that draggable will always be visible over droppable

point, element, item, ---------------------------------------------------

item
the problem you outlined is that the droppable is allowing more than 1 draggable item to be placed inside of it

element,point
the draggable is covering more than one droppable element and at this point there are multiple event.target.id s being covered

others---------------------------------------------------

real,taller,screen,tree,control,full,page
in the real case the draggable can become taller than the screen height and the tree control with the droppable is almost the full page height

tweaks,ability
when the ajax call completes and the status code is a 200 you do some minor css tweaks and then disable the ability of the droppable from receiving any more draggable items

snapmode,outer,inner,longer,active
when the draggable is dragged over the droppable you change it s snapmode option from outer to inner and then when it s dragged out and the droppable is no longer active you change it back

append,things,easier
append draggable to droppable to make things easier

validation
i have a validation on the droppable for not adding more than one draggable per droppable

unwanted,behavior,parent,element,padding,larger,snaptolerance
i was able to remove the unwanted behavior described above by turning the droppable into the parent of the element and added a margin padding that is slightly larger than the draggable snaptolerance

stuff,html,new,content
but it contains what i want draggable stuff with html injected that renders content on an iframe or a div or whatever and that new content is also droppable to insert more stuff inside that code


without draggable seems more like it but then i can t use the droppable

higher,class
to know on which droppable the draggable was dropped the higher droppable added a class to the draggable when it was dragged over it
