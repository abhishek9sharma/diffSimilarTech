neo4j,faster,effect,queries,issue,implementation
neo4j and cypher is still faster and obviously this has no effect on the gremlin queries on neo4j but that might be just a issue with the gremlin implementation for neo4j

approach,best,better,traversal,order
in this case a traversal-oriented approach is best maybe gremlin is better since cypher doesn t allow you to specify traversal order

union,possible,powerful
but i read in this post that group by on union are not possible yet it mean that cypher is less powerful than gremlin

tad,bit,pattern,matching,natural,lmk
translating this to gremlin is a tad bit tedious pattern matching in cypher is more natural but lmk if this is in the right direction and i ll do it

clear,guys,neo4j
cypher seems much more clear to me than gremlin and in general it seems that the guys in neo4j are going with cypher

queries,faster
recently we noticed that cypher queries run faster than gremlin so we decided to convert our queries
