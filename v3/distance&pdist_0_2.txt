implementation,slower,cython,memory,matrix,slow
pdist implementation was always slower than cython and takes much more memory because it explicitly creates a distance matrix which is slow because of sqrt

euclidean,faster
also note that in my code above manually calculating the euclidean distance is much faster then calling pdist
