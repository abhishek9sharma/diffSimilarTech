factors, rsa, different, ---------------------------------------------------

powers,different,p,smallest,larger
hypothesis the first n powers of two each have a different modulus when divided by p where p is the smallest primes that is larger than n

possible,rsa,factors,p
it is perfectly possible to use rsa with a modulus n that is composed of more than two primes factors p and q but two things have to be noted

better, convincing, collision, ---------------------------------------------------

better,large,collision
it would be better to use a large primes as the modulus and get much better collision resistance

convincing,argument,better,bit-swapping
someone else in this thread makes a somewhat convincing argument that modulus a primes is better for detecting bit-swapping

others---------------------------------------------------

strong,factorisation,newer
however strong primes do not protect against modulus factorisation using newer algorithms such as lenstra elliptic curve factorization and number field sieve algorithm

values,greater,value,rsa
some of the random values that you are encrypting are greater than the modulus of the key the modulus is the value of the 2 primes in the rsa key multiplied together which means values wrap-around if you set you will see that input and output always match
