process,mozilla,declaration,padding,different
my website in developing process looking in mozilla firefox with same font-size declaration margin padding and different font-families always a few smaller than in google-chrome or internet explorer

applies,top,bottom,large,larger,one
margin .67em 0 applies a top and bottom margin based on the font-size which is fairly large so that explains why the margin becomes larger when you disable the other one

padding,line-height,property,headings
if you don t want to give padding or margin at all then set the line-height property of headings more than their font-size

child,huge,smaller
the problem is that all inline child elements get a huge margin above them even if their font-size is much smaller
