use,bcrypt,combination,sha-512,sha-1
use either bcrypt on its own or pbkdf2 in combination with your sha-512 although sha-1 hmac is more than enough

complex,construction,particular,direct,input
pbkdf2 also uses a more complex construction in particular hmac over direct digest to make recovering the input password from an output value more difficult

better,salt,detail,good,discussion
an hmac is a better way of adding your salt and pbkdf2 is based on hmac - see below for more detail on pbkdf2 - there s a good discussion at when is it safe to use a broken hash function

passwords,hash,bcrypt,session,complex,random,salt
in django for example passwords are hash with pbkdf2 or bcrypt but session hash use a less complex hmac and no random salt
