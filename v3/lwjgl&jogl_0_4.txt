implementation,better
i think lwjgl has a implementation too but the jogl one is better

java-like,gaming,functionality
jogl is more java-like whereas lwjgl provides more gaming functionality on top of opengl access

gaming,opengl,worried,complete
lwjgl is much more aimed towards gaming with opengl where as jogl is more worried about complete and perfect bindings to opengl opencl

libraries,understandable,smaller
if your company s concern is to avoid big unknown libraries which is prefectly understandable i d advise you to stick with lwjgl which is smaller that jogl
