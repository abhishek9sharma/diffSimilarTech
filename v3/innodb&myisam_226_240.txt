faster, slower, table, ---------------------------------------------------

faster,fulltext,index
myisam is slightly faster than innodb and implements the fulltext index which is quite useful for integrating search capabilities

faster
i am not sure if this is no longer true myisam is faster than innodb for reads

beststat,row-level,inserts-updates,faster
beststat is innodb so i have row-level locking and consindering i do a lot of inserts-updates it should be faster than myisam

perfect,database,reading,faster
myisam is the perfect choice since the database is almost only used for reading and myisam is significantly faster that innodb

faster,worth,lack
ok there are some cases where myisam is faster than innodb but rarely enough that it s worth putting up with the lack of acid-compliance

faster,query,level,lock
myisam is faster when the query is simple but it s much slower in a high concurrent environment as its table level lock comparing to innodb s row level lock

worse,performance
i was told that innodb had worse write performance than that of myisam

faster,application,mix
innodb is actually faster than myisam in quite a few cases so it depends on what your application s mix of selects updates concurrent queries indexes buffer configuration etc

script,indexes,products,faster
the script was tested using myisam and it indexes products relatively fast much much faster than innodb

faster,recent,improvements,difference
some people have said that for reads myisam is faster but recent improvements in innodb have either alleviated or eradicated this difference

notice,slower
please notice that counting with where is not slower with innodb than it would be with myisam

database,faster
i considered changing them to innodb to make the database 100 the same but then read the myisam is faster

faster,simpler
edited to add myisam is faster than innodb because it is simpler

slower,atomic
generally speaking innodb is slower than myisam as innodb is atomic while myisam is not

tables,slower,inserts
innodb tables are even slower than myisam tables for inserts and the delayed key write option is not available

mysql,version,faster
also mysql version starting from 5.5 - innodb performs faster than myisam

pure,speed,faster
in terms of pure speed it is not always the case that myisam is faster than innodb but in my experience it tends to be faster for pure read working environments by a factor of about 2.0-2.5 times

keys,checks,faster
anyway if you don t need to have foreign keys checks myisam would be faster than innodb

wives,tale,faster
yes it is an old wives tale that myisam is faster than innodb

engines,faster,expense,lack
also note that some mysql engines are faster than others for example myisam may run faster than innodb at expense of the lack of real foreign keys

conclusion,faster,read-only,tables,inserts
2 - i have read about myisam vs innodb the conclusion for me was that myisam is faster when it comes to read-only whereas innodb is designed for tables that get updated or inserts more frequently

use,faster,data,base
use myisam usually much faster than innodb if your data base isnt transaction oriented

response,boss,faster
now the response i got from my boss is that i need to prove that innodb will run faster than myisam

indexes,slower
and innodb indexes are even slower to rewrite than myisam

faster
in general is myisam faster than innodb

core,tables,faster
note however that for high traffic websites we do modify the joomla core and we also switch the tables from innodb to myisam regardless what others might think here myisam is much faster than innodb

memory,faster,frequent,dead-locks
memory and myisam would be faster when inserting updating but if you are experiencing frequent dead-locks then innodb would be the way to go

slower,counting,long
i know innodb tends to be a bit slower than myisam on counting but this is far too long

table,slower,tables,major
innodb table is a bit slower than myisam tables but i don t think it is a major problem as you told you are using drupal system is that a kind of mult-sites like a word-press system

concensus,areas,faster
in general it seems as though the concensus is to primarily use innodb but there are still some areas in which myisam is much faster than innodb

benchmarks,faster,little,improvement
in some benchmarks i see that myisam is faster than innodb but seems i have a little improvement

use,mysql,tables,slower
by the way i use mysql 5.1.62 and the myisam tables but i also tested innodb which was even slower

time,faster,acceptable,environment
myisam is almost 4 time faster than innodb which is not acceptable in the environment we are working as i mentioned earlier that every second is worth many dollers for us

heavier
i know innodb is heavier than myisam but just how much more

table,faster,rollback,possible
myisam table is much faster than innodb but no rollback is possible

faster
myisam has proved to be faster than innodb for me

faster,safe,production
myisam is often faster than innodb but isn t safe to use in a production environment for critical data

time,table,faster
with innodb there is less time lost from table locking while myisam is faster in table readings

faster,writes,slower,reads,article
i have been told innodb is faster on executing writes but slower than myisam doing reads i cannot back this up and could not find any article that analyses this i do however have the guy that told me this in high regard feel free to ignore this point or do your own research

slower,uses,faster
innodb is slower than myisam for most uses but can perform faster in certain conditions due to a better locking mechanism

faster,whole,table,throughput
myisam is much faster for reads but since it locks the whole table for writes this is where overall throughput drops compared with innodb

faster,myth
myisam is faster than innodb for reads myth

quicker,acid-compliance,inherent
myisam will be quicker definitely because it s losing the acid-compliance that is inherent in innodb

thread,faster
in a thread i came to know that myisam is faster for reads innodb is faster for writes

trope,faster,holdover,current
the trope about myisam being faster than innodb is a holdover from code that was current in the mid-2000 s

insert,performance,slower,tokudb
at the beginning the insert performance of innodb is almost 50 times slower than myisam and tokudb is 40 times slower than myisam

transactional,inserts,slower
innodb is transactional so inserts will generally be slower than myisam

inserts,faster,data,later
myisam inserts are going to be faster than innodb so if you re logging data and retrieving it later that will be a win

faster,types,queries
myisam is not faster than innodb anymore for most types of queries

slower,huge,select
also innodb is slower than myisam unless myisam is blocking for a huge select

faster,abit
i heard myisam is faster but others say innodb can be fast also but it takes abit more to optimize it

better,concurrency,contexts,faster
have you considered changing to innodb - it has much better concurrency support and in some contexts will run faster than myisam

faster,simpler,design
myisam can be faster than innodb because it has a simpler design

speed,faster
speed does matter here myisam is still slightly faster than innodb especially for reads

slower
why is innodb so much slower than myisam in my case

faster,raw,performance
myisam is often faster than innodb in terms of raw performance mostly because it is not acid

slower
innodb is slower than myisam but in which cases

faster
myisam for reads may well be faster than innodb

slower,count
after all innodb shouldn t be slower than myisam when using count + where but that s exactly what is happening here

faster,certain,functions,rollback...,table
myisam generally performs faster because it lacks certain functions innodb has such as rollback... but it has only table locking

slower,transactional,engine
innodb is often slower than myisam being a transactional db engine with acid properties

table,type,faster,overhead
if you are not using transactions while storing or updating tables switch table type to myisam its quite faster than innodb with much less overhead

slower
however innodb tends to be slower as myisam

faster
you are right because myisam is really faster than innodb

faster,clause
after testing it seems that myisam is faster than innodb when using when there is no where clause

table,type,faster,transactional,support
also table type of myisam will import faster depends on if you need transactional support innodb

faster,use,transactions
myisam is faster but does not support the use of transactions like innodb does

slower
innodb shouldn t be much slower than myisam

faster,concurrent,updates
we know that myisam is faster than innodb when we don t have many concurrent updates inserts

slower,implementation,slow
oh and just incase you were thinking innodb is slower than myisam - the myisam implementation i tested was twice as slow in all counts

faster,benchmarks
innodb not only has the advantages you list but it is also faster than myisam in many benchmarks

faster,queries,quicker
while myisam can be faster for some queries innodb is usually quicker if properly tuned

opinion,use,faster,speed
in my opinion myisam use to be faster than innodb now they are pretty much the same in speed

database,performance,necessary,faster,engine
database performance of the innodb is not necessary faster than the myisam engine

plain,wrong,faster
it is a massive over simplification in some cases and plain wrong in others to say we know that myisam is faster than innodb

faster,marginal
innodb seems slightly faster than myisam but this is really marginal

modifications,data,faster,row,table
if there are many modifications of the data it s said that innodb works faster because it uses row locking instead of table locking like myisam

slower,databases,row,level
innodb is slower for read only databases because it has features acid compliant row level locking that myisam leaves out

read-performance,link,slower
edit for the read-performance this link shows that innodb often is actually not slower than myisam

faster,row,locks,mvcc,full-table
and it s rarely faster than innodb since innodb uses row locks and mvcc as opposed to myisam s full-table locks

better, acid, integrity, ---------------------------------------------------

higher,levels,concurrency,better
therefore innodb can handle higher levels of concurrency better than myisam

better,performance,separate,index
analytics -- when you can scan via the clustered pk you get better performance with innodb than with myisam which has to bounce back and forth between the separate index and the data

engine,better,queries
as well i used innodb engine but myisam is better if most of the queries are select and you are not going to do many writes

mysql,engines,better
1 in mysql engines myisam is better or innodb

better
almost always innodb is a better choice than myisam

better,advanced,features
myisam is better than innodb when you don t need those advanced features and storage speed is more important than other concerns

better,mysql
firstly i switched from innodb to myisam which is better designed for mysql spatial extensions

tables,smaller,better,data,integrity
you can also use compression on the tables to keep them smaller but innodb is vastly better than myisam at data integrity

oracle,better,situations
oracle has kept improving innodb by so much that they declare that it is better than myisam in virtually all situations

better,crash,recovery,poor
innodb has better crash recovery while myisam is poor at recovering

better,performance,acid,transactions
i currently have myisam and i would like to stay with it because it had far better performance than innodb in my case but i heard that innodb has acid transactions

better
but when myisam is really better than innodb

better,inadecuate
finally even if somehow you could manage myisam to perform better than innodb that doesn t mean innodb is inadecuate at all

reliable,mysql,better
as for reliability i think that postgresql is more reliable especially when compared to mysql using myisam - innodb is a lot better here

documents,updates,better
in many discussions and even in mysql documents it has been mentioned that in case of updates innodb performs much better than myisam

application,better
so for such an application is it will innodb be a better choice over myisam

oracle,better
in fact oracle is so sure that innodb is better that they removed myisam from 8.0

susceptible,data,corruption,better
myisam is more susceptible to data corruption than innodb and usually innodb performs better because it caches both data and indexes

select,today,better
you insert in there but never select from there as far as i know today myisam is better than innodb in this case

better,high,read,volumes
myisam is better for high read volumes innodb for high update volumes due to table vs row locking

complex,simpler
innodb is more complex while myisam is simpler

scales,better
innodb scales better than myisam

fine,certain,better
often myisam is fine in certain other cases innodb is better

interviews,benefits,better
sometimes i got asked on some interviews what benefits does innodb have against myisam and when myisam is better than innodb

certain,better
but in certain scenarios myisam works better than innodb

someone,better
someone just told me that innodb is much better than myisam

better
since myisam is better on selecting while innodb is better on writing

better,high-write,table
innodb would be a better choice than myisam for a high-write table

sub-question,better,engine
as a sub-question do you think innodb would be a better choice of engine here than myisam

database,tables,transactions,better
you can change your database to myisam -- i m guessing you re only reading from the tables in the database otherwise if you have read write transactions innodb is the better choice

better,data,integrity,matter,engine
generally innodb is much better for preserving your data integrity so stick with it and do not go back to myisam there is also a matter of what each engine is best fore but unless you give us more details there is no point in dwelling on that

better
this is one way in which innodb is sometimes better than myisam

better
innodb when tuned well performs better than myisam

updates,better
since you don t do updates i think myisam would be better than innodb in this scenario

better,handling,bulk
you can also try using innodb since it s said is better than myisam handling bulk inserts with data already on it

high,performance,better
if you use insert and update high performance uses innodb over myisam is better

table,engine,better,full,text
also i can t see your table engine but myisam is better for full text searching rather than innodb

engine,better,foreign
additionally i ve changed the db engine from myisam to innodb to have better foreign key support

better,read-oriented,tables
i have heard that myisam performs better than innodb on read-oriented tables

application,better
it is said that if you have a mostly read based application you should use myisam as it is better than innodb

better,operations
then i thought about innodb but then i read that myisam is better with many write operations

entire,table,better,handling
myisam locks the entire table while innodb do a better handling of rows being changed

safer,acid,engine,integrity
innodb is a safer acid compliant engine with some integrity features that myisam lacks

better
so i guess myisam would be better suited than innodb

better
mostly innodb is better choice than a myisam

better,read,performance,cost,acid
myisam delivers better read performance compared to innodb at the cost of being less acid compliant

literature,better,faster,old
most of the literature that says myisam is better faster whatever then innodb is old literature

better,old,engine
innodb is a better choice as myisam is really old engine and would fade away in near future

better,crash,recovery,poor,data
innodb has better crash recovery while myisam is poor at recovering data integrity at system crashes

problems,recordings,bugs,better
myisam has some problems with many recordings and other bugs and innodb is now better

quicker, boost, composite, ---------------------------------------------------

inserts,composite,keys,quicker
innodb handles inserts with composite primary keys quicker than myisam

performance,boost,quicker,fulltext,mysql
this is a huge performance boost look like myisam is much more quicker for fulltext in mysql than innodb

performance, closer, model, ---------------------------------------------------

conclusion,higher,performance,average
their conclusion innodb has 30 higher performance than myisam on average

closer,model,performance
this would help myisam come closer to innodb s model and performance but would add complexity to your code

newer, older, transaction, ---------------------------------------------------

newer,older
innodb is newer while myisam is older

newer,transaction,safe
innodb is relatively newer than myisam and is transaction safe

optimization, storage, level, ---------------------------------------------------

database,engine,longer,whole,table
although 4m isn t that many rows with contention and depending on your structure and database engine it may take a while i think myisam alters take longer than innodb because myisam requires whole table locks and handles concurrency less well

storage,engine,row,level,mysql,optimization
3 a first of all if you haven t done yet change the storage engine to innodb which has row level locking and in newer versions of mysql has more optimization than myisam has

table, stuff, records, ---------------------------------------------------

new,table,insert,gb,excess,stuff,data,larger
put another way let s say i start with a new innodb table and insert 20 gb of data assuming that 20 gb incorporates all the excess innodb stuff i realize data stored in innodb is larger than myisam then i delete all data then i insert 10 gb of data

table,engine,large,number,records,faster,data,contrary,indexes
if you have so many records in the table then the first thing is to change the table engine to innodb if its not innodb because for large number of records innodb is much faster as it caches the table data while on the contrary myisam engine only caches the indexes so each time it has to do a full table scan from disk if the data required cannot be fetched from index

differences, hanky, comment, ---------------------------------------------------

google,differences
google myisam vs innodb to find out more about the differences

comment,hanky,differences
the comment of hanky that linked to myisam versus innodb tells you more about the differences

strict, efficient, integrity, ---------------------------------------------------

strict,data,integrity
innodb is more strict in data integrity while myisam is not as

situations,efficient,large,data
there are some situations when myisam is infinitely more efficient than innodb when manipulating large data dumps offline because of table lock

default, better, values, ---------------------------------------------------

exotic,corner,better,certain,work,default
there may be some exotic corner cases where myisam performs marginally better for certain workloads table-scans or high-volume insert-only work but the default choice should be innodb unless you can prove you have a case that myisam does better

tuning,better,engine,different,values,fast-but-unsafe,default
tuning innodb which is the better engine requires adjusting different values than myisam which is often the fast-but-unsafe default

better, solution, bulletproof, ---------------------------------------------------

engine,faster,large,data,counting,better,safe
the engine is myisam i ve heard people recommend switching to innodb but many others said myisam is faster with large amounts of data in terms of counting and innodb better for safe transactions

better,solution,tables,data,bulletproof,paul,transactions
a better solution is not to use myisam for tables where the data is constantly changing - innodb is much more bulletproof and as paul correctly points out you can use transactions on innodb tables but not on myisam

table-level, common, big, ---------------------------------------------------

slower,searches,text,search,big,table-level
innodb can be slower at searches because it doesn t offer full text search like myisam but that isn t a big problem when you compare it to table-level locking of myisam

worth,row-level,table-level,common,situations,faster,queries
it s also worth mentioning that innodb supports row-level locking while myisam only supports table-level locking - which is to say that for many common situations innodb can be dramatically faster due to more queries executing in parallel

default, gurus, at-least, ---------------------------------------------------

mysql,gurus,default,reliable,slower,use
you should use innodb in such scenarios and most mysql gurus recommend using innodb by default anyway because it s considered more generally reliable than myisam despite being slower under some use cases

memory,at-least,reading,engine,default,mysql
and now i have learned that innodb uses more memory at-least while reading than myisam engine so i am trying to change the default engine of mysql to use myisam

longer, primary, practice, ---------------------------------------------------

primary,keys,longer
one thing is that if your inserts are not in the order of increasing primary keys innodb can take a bit longer than myisam

primary,noticeable,difference
innodb is affected by the primary key much more than myisam and it could make a noticeable difference

practice,longer
so that means that in practice an innodb write will take 3 times longer than a myisam write

longer,rows
myisam supports longer rows than innodb does

space, disk, cheap, ---------------------------------------------------

disk,space,2x-3x
innodb consumes more disk space than myisam -- typically 2x-3x

space,friendly
myisam is more space friendly than innodb you can start with that one

disk,space,cheap,benefits
it s true there are some cases where myisam can use less disk space but disk space is cheap and i d much rather get the benefits of innodb

data,space
myisam also tends to store data in less space than innodb

others---------------------------------------------------

doubt,memory,indexes,better,specific,result
your table sounds fairly large so i doubt it s being held entirely in memory but it sounds like innodb handles indexes better than myisam anyway plus since you re being so specific it may be caching the result of the query

table,concurrent,requests
myisam table locking so innodb can handle more concurrent requests

row,level,table,crash,revovery,better
innodb uses row level locking while myisam can only use table level locking that is why innodb has crash revovery is better than myisam

reliable
innodb is more reliable than myisam

higher,throughput
innodb delivered 4.6x higher throughput than myisam while achieving

quicker,instance,time,well-tuned,table,locks
myisam might be quicker in this instance but when you have 100 concurrent connections all reading and modifying this table at the same time you ll find a well-tuned innodb will win and myisam will choke on table locks

performant,conundrum,enigma
not sure why people think myisam is more performant than innodb - it s a conundrum wrapped in an enigma

tables,composite,extra,primary,table
if there are more than one innodb tables that need a composite auto_incrementing primary key add an extra primary key to the myisam table

tables,smaller,footprints,ones,myth
myisam tables have smaller footprints than innodb ones myth

overhead,row-level,problems,table
innodb has more overhead but uses row-level locking so that reads and writes can happen concurrently without the problems that myisam s table locking incurs

web,applications,faster,situations,access
myisam is still widely used in web applications as it has traditionally been perceived as faster than innodb in situations where most db access is reads

memory,actual,data,files,larger
myisam uses less memory than innodb and the actual data files are often quite a bit larger for innodb

storage,engines,faster,select,insert
there is a difference between the different storage engines though myisam is faster for a lot of select innodb is faster for a lot of insert update because it uses row locking instead of table locking and the way it handles indexes

concurrent,row-level
innodb is more concurrent than myisam since it provides row-level locking

weird,behavior,tables,consistent
mind that i ve seen weird behavior from myisam tables -- innodb tables are more consistent

slower,insert,full,index
this also affects how it is stored which leads to myisam being slower than innodb on insert due to myisam requiring a full index re-write on every insertion

slower,inserts,durability,good,performance
if you find that innodb is much slower for inserts updates bear in mind that it offers a much better level of durability - if you tune it for approximately the same durability as myisam then you ll see good performance hopefully

lone,exception,older,mysql,corruption,worse
the lone exception is myisam which is an older mysql storage engine which does not support transactions is more prone to corruption and generally tends to perform worse than innodb

faster,certain,spatial,indexes,transactional,concurrent
myisam is faster for certain queries and supports fulltext and spatial indexes while innodb is transactional and more concurrent

pattern,indexes,slower,full,unrestricted
if you use a where clause though it changes the execution pattern to use indexes so in general innodb will be slower than myisam on full unrestricted counts where as the performance matches up on restricted counts

tables,bigger,counterparts
innodb tables are about 4x bigger than their myisam counterparts

transactions,referential,trade-off,slower
innodb does support transactions and referential integrity but the trade-off is that it is a bit slower than myisam

strict,data,integrity,loose
innodb is more strict in data integrity while myisam is loose

faster,data,reporting,etc..,normal
myisam is faster in data warehousing situations such as full table scan reporting etc.. but innodb can actually be faster in many cases with normal oltp queries

resources
therefore accessing myisam consumes less resources than innodb

right,better,frequent,updates,inserts
am i right that innodb is better for frequent concurrent updates and inserts than myisam

resistant,table,corruption
innodb is more resistant to table corruption than myisam

performance,reading,tables,count,index,clauses,table,slower
generally you can have as good performance for reading as in myisam in innodb tables - you just can use count without where clause and you always should have a suitable index for where clauses as in innodb table scan will be slower than in myisam


innodb is also being developed more than myisam

faster,data,better,hdd-space,smaller,disk
innodb was faster when data was present already and generally performed better except for hdd-space - myisam is smaller on disk

better,tables,available,insert,row,level,updates,table
innodb is usually much better than myisam at tables being available while insert update and delete are happening because innodb uses row level locking for updates whereas myisam uses table level locking

count,group,slower,row
in innodb the count s when where group by or join is not used execute slower than in myisam because the row count is not stored internally

database,large,buffer,pool,small,performance,better
if your database has a large innodb buffer pool and a small key buffer then innodb performance is going to be better than myisam performance especially for large tables

likely,good,idea,tables
by the way the reason this happened is because you are likely using myisam instead of innodb - it is a good idea to switch to innodb as innodb tables are less likely to crash

storage,engine,performance,sessions
if your db storage engine is not wisely chosen like myisam instead of innodb you ll lose more performance than you might win with avoiding sessions

prone,problems
myisam is more prone to locking problems than innodb i believe

anyone,faster,tuning,small,data
anyone who thinks myisam is faster is either not tuning innodb correctly or has such small data that who cares

area,buffer,better,job
in this area i think innodb s change buffer does a better job than myisam s do it now

effecient,primary,data
innodb -- more effecient than myisam because of the way the primary key is clustered with the data in innodb

correct,wrong,better,tables,row,table
i heard correct me if i am wrong that innodb is better for tables that will be updated a lot because of row locking opposed to myisam s table locking

performance,point,hard,benchmark,faster
innodb performance has been improved to the point where it is hard to come up with a benchmark that says myisam is faster

complex,keys,structure,foreign,slow
innodb provides more complex keys structure than myisam foreign keys and regenerating keys is really slow in innodb

general,rule,quicker,table,growth
there are other optimizations available but general rule is that innodb will be quicker than myisam is even with table growth

antiquated,hardware,necessity,modern,better
while on antiquated hardware myisam was a necessity on modern hardware innodb actually performs better

transactional,safety,storage,engine,able,switching,efficient,aggregate
if that s true then you might not need all the transactional safety provided by the innodb storage engine and you might be able to get away with switching to myisam which is considerably more efficient on aggregate queries

faster,recent,versions,smaller,set
myisam has historically been viewed as faster than innodb but for recent versions of innodb that is true for a much much smaller set of use cases

scalable,properties,acid
innodb is more scalable and myisam doesn t support any of the properties of acid

type,10mb,15b,row,30mb
while the myisam type takes around 10mb average of 15b for each row the innodb type takes more than 30mb average of 44b

tables,suitable
plus you have to make your tables myisam which is generally less suitable than innodb

stricter
innodb is much much stricter than myisam

mysqlhotcopy,inly,tables,applications,better
3 mysqlhotcopy inly works on myisam tables and in most applications you are better off with innodb

tests,contention,issues,model,slower
during my tests of innodb v myisam i found that when i did resolve any contention issues the innodb model was 40 slower than myisam

memory,dataset,archived
you will need about six times less disk space to store and memory to process your dataset compared to innodb or about 2-3 times less than archived myisam

versions,mysql,features,available,fulltext,geospatial,indexing,performance,better
newer versions of mysql 5.5+ have extended innodb to support all the features that were previously only available on myisam such as fulltext and geospatial indexing and innodb performance is usually considerably better than myisam when configured properly

last,suggestion,investigation,faster
a last suggestion is to convert your db from myisam to innodb but i think this requires some investigation because it not always the case that innodb is faster

select,queries,2x,faster,updates,insert,slower
select queries in myisam runs 2x faster then in innodb but the updates and insert queries are much slower in myisam

good,read,performer,benchmarks,indexes,faster
myisam is also considered a good read performer however my benchmarks show me that innodb indexes are faster

tables,compact,size,disk
myisam tables are generally more compact in size on disk when compared to innodb tables

suprise,hours
to our suprise innodb took hours more than myisam

better,semantics,data,integrity,performance,targets
innodb supports better locking semantics so if there will be occasional or frequent writes or if you want better data integrity i d suggest starting there and then benchmarking myisam later if you can t hit your performance targets

past,years,today,faster
but innodb has improved dramatically in the past few years and in most cases today innodb performs faster than myisam

doesnt,number,cached,value,column,null,cause
innodb doesnt read number of rows from stored cached value like myisam does if column is not null cause innodb is more optimized for writing than reading opposing to myisam

several,slower,topic,opposite
there are several q a for why is innodb much slower than myisam but i could not find any topic for the opposite

advanced
i don t want to use myisam because innodb is more advanced

figure,contention,faster,rapid,lock
i ve figure out that even though myisam has locking contention it s still faster than innodb in most scenarios because of the rapid lock acquisition scheme it uses

mvcc,multi-versioning,control,complex
innodb implements mvcc multi-versioning concurrency control so locking is much more complex than with myisam

dont,wampserver
most dont bother to close wampserver down cleanly and therefore innodb can get corrupted more easily than myisam

type,system,sensible,contention,different
for an oltp type system innodb is usually more sensible than myisam did you check the contention before trying a different engine

data,mysql,higher,performance,transactions,faster,reliable
out of experience i m involved to a project that uses huge amount of data using mysql and we mostly prefer myisam for data that can be generated it allows to achieve much higher performance losing transactions but generally speaking myisam is faster but innodb is more reliable

harder,knobs,system,higher,throughput,better
innodb is harder to tune since it has more knobs but a properly tuned innodb system can often have higher throughput than myisam due to better locking and better i o patterns

drawback,server,resources,proper
only drawback is that innodb need more server resources than myisam so if you have proper server resources then you should use innodb

benchmark,results,par,faster,workloads
even this blog from 2007 shows benchmark results that innodb is on par with or faster than myisam under most workloads

better,performance,attention,tuning,configuration,atomic,changes,foreign,keys,resistant,data
innodb has better performance than myisam though innodb needs more attention to tuning the configuration innodb supports atomic changes transactions foreign keys and innodb is much more resistant to corrupting data in a crash

higher,resource,consumption,rates,mind
innodb has a higher resource consumption rates then myisam so keep that in mind

faster,years,current,version,workloads
myisam used to be faster years ago but if you use any reasonably current version of innodb then innodb is faster for most workloads

first,normal,slower,7x,usage
first question is it normal that innodb is much slower 7x slower than myisam for such usage

table,sizes,smaller,tables
as you know myisam table sizes are about three or more times smaller than same innodb tables

possible,config,engine,efficient,searches
it is possible that the config of your innodb engine is more efficient for your searches than the way you have myisam set up

real,slower,authoritative,answer
to answer the real question why is myisam slower than innodb i can t give an authoritative answer

nothing,safe,safer,data,loss
nothing is 100 safe but innodb properly used is a lot safer than myisam against data loss and corruption
