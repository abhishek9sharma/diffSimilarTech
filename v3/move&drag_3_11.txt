thumb, press, table, ---------------------------------------------------

mouse,press,release,order,able,bigger,parent,drop
i reimplemented the mouse move press and release events for the inner widget in order to be able to move it inside its bigger parent with drag drop

confusion...you,cannot,table,bigger,smaller,mouse,size
it ends up in a state of confusion...you basically cannot release the drag of the table it keeps getting bigger and smaller as you move your mouse - but you can never let go and release it to get the size you want

mouse,cursor,slider,thumb,speed,lower
but if he move the mouse cursor away from the slider while he is still dragging the slider s thumb the drag speed is lower

others---------------------------------------------------

select,buttons,loop,item,difficult,reordering
this is easy to implement with buttons select items click up or down buttons to move - just loop through and apply the move to each selected item but much more difficult with drag reordering

autosizes,content,listboxitem,wider
textbox autosizes to its content that s ok but when drag apperas the listboxitem becomes wider and move other items it s not ok

events,operation,initial,laggy
i use all the events for the drag operation so maybe the initial move is less laggy perceptually in this case

mouse-down,mouse-move,greater,threshold
a mouse-down followed by a mouse-move is a drag if the move is greater than some threshold to allow for human motion while clicking

distance,treat
by setting the move distance to 4000 i am basically saying if your drag is less than 4000 treat it as a click

press,image,nothing,time,finger
in other words if i press the image and there is no move recorded for more then 1s nothing happens during this time but if i suddenly move the finger i already see the resized image but if i start moving in less then 1s i see how the image gets resized in the way while i drag it

object,ui,slower,mouse
i got a draggable object done with jquery ui and when i drag it it s way slower than i move my mouse

effect,force,spaceship,faster,harder,motion,ship
the overall effect is that the drag force increases as the spaceship move faster making it harder to accelerate in the direction of motion when the ship move faster
