direction, axis, idx, ---------------------------------------------------

idx,lower,element,higher
so floor idx is the lower element and ceil idx is the higher

fractions,direction,higher,std,lower
on the other hand if what you want to do is not rounding but elimination of fractions into one direction then you have std ceil that goes always higher and std floor that always goes lower

higher,lower,axis
now if floor is higher than 0 or ceil is lower than 0 on any axis it means that there just as many tiles outside of the camera scoop

greater, function, decimal, ---------------------------------------------------

works,b,greater
works because ceil a b is always one greater than floor a b except when a b is a whole number

function,greater,multiplier,decimal
a simple function to follow would be if greater than 0 floor else ceil using a multiplier to raise it above the decimal point temporarily whilst doing it

others---------------------------------------------------

greater,possible
the floor times the ceil are greater than the floor xy...that s very much possible

drawimage,smoother,results
Ã¢ when using drawimage coordinates will be rounded for you you might want to do the rounding yourself since it is floor that is used and that ceil that gives smoother results

values,larger,max,smaller,min
in general case you need to determine maximum and minimum shape coordinates along every axis and define minimum axis aligned integer bounding box with values rounded to larger using ceil for max and rounded to smaller using floor for min coordinates
