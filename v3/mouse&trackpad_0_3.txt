trouble,#inner,usual,arrow,keys,wheel
let s boil your trouble down to this if the mouse is over #inner you can t use the usual methods spacebar arrow keys trackpad wheel to scroll #outer up and down

deltas,orders,magnitude,higher,scroll,speed
unfortunately the trackpad s scrolling deltas are orders of magnitude higher than a mouse s so the scroll speed is psychotically high

sensitive,breakpoint,increment,wheel,section
the trackpad is much more sensitive and can get the breakpoint increment correctly but the mouse wheel ends up scrolling through the section much quicker without correctly keeping up with the proper frame rate so i never end up reach the final frame by the end of the section
