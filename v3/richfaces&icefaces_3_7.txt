useful,product,better,quality,documentation
that said i found icefaces to be a useful product and much better than richfaces especially in terms of the quality of the documentation

semantic,support,nitobi,suite
there is icefaces which provides more semantic support than richfaces .also you can try nitobi suite which also provides similar kinda solution.if you are not satisfied with any of these i suggest try to write your own part extending the sun faces

part,research,primefaces,better,applications
i did my part of the research and found out that either richfaces or primefaces would be better but most of my applications were developed using icefaces

personal,experience,mixed,better,jsf,libs,advanced,ajax
my personal experience with both richfaces mixed better with other jsf libs icefaces has more advanced ajax capabilities like server sided push kinda like comet the basic ajax functionality is easier to set up and use but plays difficult sometimes when you mix it with other jsf libs
