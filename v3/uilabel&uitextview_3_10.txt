cause, requirement, results, ---------------------------------------------------

better,results
instead of using uilabel using uitextview gets better results

similar,requirement,better
i too had a similar requirement initially i used uilabel and then i realized that uitextview is better

better,cause,contentview
try to use uitextview rather than uilabel could be better cause uitextview use a contentview that maybe won t be resized immediatly

others---------------------------------------------------

nsattributedstring,priority,interesting,custom,kind,object
using a category on nsattributedstring in priority before uilabel could be more interesting in case you wanted to use the custom nsattributedstring for others kind of object like a uitextview

uitextfield
you would have to use a uitextfield or a uitextview - uitextview being more like a uilabel than a uitextfield

complicated
my problem is uitextview is more complicated than uilabel

easier,objects,uiscrollview
or even easier rather than adding uilabel objects to a uiscrollview you could just use a uitextview

padding,right,bigger
i think the problem happened because the padding left right of uitextview is bigger than uilabel

aware,suitable,uitextinput,bug,ios
i m aware that uitextview is much more suitable for this as it implements uitextinput protocol which has all the methods i need but due to a bug in ios i m limited to uilabel

need,information,longer,slower
also consider using uilabel instead of uitextview if you don t need to edit information inside since uitextview take longer to allocate and init and are generally slower than uilabel
