add-in,architecture,cleaner,project,different,model
using mef for the add-in architecture over prism can be cleaner because the reasons for each project are vastly different and mef has a cleaner model i think it can also act as a basic ioc container

type,situation,easier,dynamic
i personally think combining prism with mef makes this type of situation easier though since mef allows for easier dynamic extensibility for roles

modularity,top,bottom,wheras,modules,granular
this means with mef you have modularity from top to bottom wheras with prism modules are more granular units

easier,world,tutorial
mef seemed a bit easier than prism and i started to do a hello world mef app with this tutorial
