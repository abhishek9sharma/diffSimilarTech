structured,basic,mins
2 yii a bit more structured than codeigniter but you have a basic app up within 10 mins and if your familiar with mvc design its a great way to develop portals incredibly quickly

apps,quicker,code-gen,active,record,harder
you can build apps a lot quicker with yii due to the code-gen and active record but it will be a bit harder to learn than codeigniter


i have worked on codeigniter but yii is far more ahead of that

yii has a higher learning curve than say codeigniter and cakephp

in looking into different frameworks the routing mechanisms they have and the different alternatives employed to make them go faster such as with codeigniter wordpress yii and symphony with alternative caching options how would you do a like-for-like is it possible
