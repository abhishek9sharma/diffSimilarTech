fonts, tools, larger, ---------------------------------------------------

tools,fonts,bigger,font,size
i am trying to explore kde a bit but many of the tools i rely on have fonts that appear so much bigger under kde than gnome even though the chosen font size is the same and the resolution is the same 1920x1200

font,size,larger
the motivation is that font size 12 under kde seems to be much larger than under gnome

aptana,quicker,best
on kde aptana ran perfectly quicker than on gnome at the best of times

gtk+,native,whereas,qt
on gnome gtk+ can be seen as more native whereas on kde qt is more native
