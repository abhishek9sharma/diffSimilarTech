nirvdrum, worse, superior, ---------------------------------------------------

nirvdrum,easier,kde,superior,flexibility
even though git-svn or the nirvdrum svn2git is easier to start with here are some further reasons why using the kde svn2git instead of git-svn is superior besides its flexibility

worse,kde,superior
there are many reasons why git-svn is worse and the kde svn2git is superior

easier,kde,superior,flexibility
even though git-svn is easier to start with here are some further reasons why using the kde svn2git instead of git-svn is superior besides its flexibility

worse,kde,superior
you see there are many reasons why git-svn is worse and the kde svn2git is superior

tools, use-case, one-time, ---------------------------------------------------

one-time,conversion,use-case
it is great if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for a one-time conversion you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case

one-time,conversions,use-case
it is a great tool if you want to use git as a frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case

one-time,conversions,use-case
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case

one-time,conversions,use-case,oom
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case and should not suffer from oom error

one-time,conversions,right,use-case
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but the right svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case

one-time,conversions,tools,use-case
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn or tools based on it but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case

one-time,conversions,use-case,proper
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case and also makes proper git tags from the svn tags

others---------------------------------------------------

better
would svn2git be better that git-svn for this scenario

better,results,tags,branches.
using svn2git might produce better results than git-svn if you have tags or branches.

easier,kde,superior,flexibility
even though git-svn or the svn2git you used is easier to start with here are some further reasons why using the kde svn2git instead of git-svn is superior besides its flexibility
