first,pattern
the capturing group 1 in the first pattern is greedy it first matches everything and takes as less as it backtracking

regex,matches,search,end
but this is not a good regex because matches zero or more times with greedy for every search it will go to the end then it will backtracking to match the

next,number,steps,fewer,matching
since the next is not far the number of backtracking steps is much fewer than with greedy matching

spirit,print_p
for your code to work spirit would need to recognize that the greedy print_p matched too much and then backtracking to allow matching less
