solutions,kqueue,macosx,epoll,dev,poll,better,small
and platform-specific solutions as kqueue bsd macosx epoll linux dev poll solaris are better if relatively small subset of all descriptors is ready on each cycle

particular,servers,generic,unix,tools,welcome
my case in particular is with solaris servers but generic unix bsd tools are more than welcome

support,better
bsd find and gnu find but not solaris find support better units than just c for characters bytes
