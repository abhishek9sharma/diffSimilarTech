better
i prefer sublimetext 2 but notepad++ or scite might suit you better

time,several,seconds,file,pre-evaluation
sublimetext 3 needs much more time several seconds more then scite before the opened file shows up and i suppose it is because sublimetext does some pre-evaluation of the file content like detecting areas suitable for folding there are fold triangles available depending on indentation of non-white characters in the file
