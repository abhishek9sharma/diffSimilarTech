divinding, quaternion, decimal, ---------------------------------------------------

faster,inverse
i believe that division would be faster than multiplying by the inverse since the inverse has to be calculated first then multiplication performed

quaternion,b,nothing,multiplicative,inverse
division of quaternion a by quaternion b is nothing more than multiplying a by the multiplicative inverse of b

single,fp,slower,op
according to agner s instruction tables a single fp division is slower than a single reciprocal op and a single multiplying op

slower,decimal,number
i presume that you know that using a division is a lot slower than multiplying by decimal number 5 is always slower than 0.2

operator,multiplicative,operators,slower
my question i would rather not use the multiplying operator as multiplicative division operators are slower to execute on my target

left-shift,divinding,shift,faster,operation
these can be compared to multiplying by 2 x left-shift or divinding by 2 x right-shift but it should be noted that a binary shift is much faster than a division operation

note, performance, dshin, ---------------------------------------------------

note,dshin,faster,performance,improvement
note that i ve incorporated dshin s comment that multiplying is faster than division however the performance improvement is about 90 removing the binary search 10 multiplication vs

jit,performance,critical,slower
sure that s probably compiled or jit d away but you should avoid division in performance critical code it s far slower than multiplying

others---------------------------------------------------

height,tree,total,time,better,part
but in normal case it takes n 2 comparison so you half the height of tree but you multiplying each merge with two so total running time is not better than division to 2 part

programming,practice,floating-point,representation,multiplication,faster
in usual programming practice one wouldn t bother and simply multiplying by the floating-point representation of 180 ï because multiplication is so much faster than division

integer,better,first,divide
while working with integer division it s better to multiplying first and divide later to minimize the rounding error

accurate,reciprocal
perhaps it s the case that division is much more accurate than reciprocal plus multiplying

irrational,number,notice,routine,precision
to improve on the multiplying by this irrational number notice how the division routine gave lots more precision didnt need to be that extreme assuming 16 bit numbers using 32 bit math operations

multiplication,complicated,compiler,helper,functions,64-bit,numbers
multiplication and division are much more complicated and the compiler usually produces some small helper functions to deal with these whenever you multiplying 64-bit numbers together

digit,concise,larger,factors,efficient,result
but determining the digit and the carry by division is much more concise and for the larger factors also much more efficient when multiplying a digit by 100 the result is on average 450 requiring 45 subtractions but two divisions are sufficient for all factors

resources.â,divide
division typically uses more resources.â to avoid division we multiplying rather than divide

bit,application,numbers,values,faster,machine
in a 64 bit application this code will be a lot faster than in a 32 bit application in a 32 bit application multiplying two 64 bit numbers take 3 multiplication and 3 additions on 32 bit values - however it might be still faster than a division on a 32 bit machine

harder,subtractions,remainder,oodles
division is much harder to calculate with subtractions can t go too far find remainder - if a float then calculate fraction from remainder which in itself is oodles of add multiplying and subtract

pemdas,precedence
i read about python following pemdas that is precedence of multiplying is more than division
