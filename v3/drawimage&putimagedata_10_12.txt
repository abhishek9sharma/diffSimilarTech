as of right now drawimage is much faster than putimagedata

slower,earlier,year
that beeing said putimagedata is much slower than drawimage at least when i tested them earlier this year

slower,old,browser
the only problem that as far as i know using drawimage is slower than using putimagedata and it was required in old browser versions like firefox 2 or such

getimagedata, pixel, manipulation, ---------------------------------------------------

use,getimagedata,easier
don t use getimagedata putimagedata for clipping since drawimage is easier and faster.

pixel,manipulation,getimagedata,slower
if you don t intend to do pixel manipulation you should only use drawimage without getimagedata putimagedata which are slower though

others---------------------------------------------------

curious,function,2d,api,note,faster,unintuitive
if you get curious and discover the putimagedata function in the canvas 2d api please note that drawimage is much faster which might be unintuitive

clipping,version,faster
using the clipping version of drawimage will be faster than putimagedata

performant
is putimagedata ... more performant than drawimage ...
