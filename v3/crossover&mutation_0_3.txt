bits,points,possible,better,solution,rate,higher,variation,next
bits so more crossover points are possible also inside a floating point number or is the better solution to set the mutation rate higher and let mutation add more variation in the next generation

easier
mutation is typically easier to do this with than crossover

use,better,solutions
when i use only mutation i find better solutions than when i add in crossover
