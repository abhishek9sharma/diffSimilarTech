last, iterator, second, ---------------------------------------------------

item,last,second,checks,smaller
it compares every item except the last - it will be checked by the second last item and checks whether the next item is smaller

iterator,element,operation,multi,smaller,unlikely
moving iterator from one element to the next is an o c operation both in the list and in the multi map except c is slightly smaller for the list so it is unlikely you ll gain much by combining the two

greater, integer, lower, ---------------------------------------------------

ceiling,number,amount,greater,lower,integer
now i would like to take the ceiling of this number except in cases where the amount it is greater than the next lower integer is smaller than some epsilon

number,greater
it works except for in the case of the next number being greater than the current one

others---------------------------------------------------

slower,molasses,adventure
once i did that all went well except for being slower than molasses which begins my next adventure

else,statement,digit,greater,max1,first,digits
for such numbers as 54321 the else statement will be executed never because any next digit is greater than max1 except the first two digits

input,equal,try,better,idea
not totally sure what you want to do but using a while checking if the user input is equal to next and if not trying to cast to int using a try except is a better idea

synchronisation,matter,nice,song,sooner
for music like what i am using it for the synchronisation didn t really matter except that it s nice having the next song come on sooner than later when changing tracks

solution,faster,clauses
the next solution is faster than using in and except clauses

purpose,complexity,accordion,better,easier,section,tabs
for me they serve pretty same purpose to hide complexity except accordion is imho better for continuous-reading it s easier to quickly go to next section while tabs seems to be more random-access

a1,cell,right,wider,screens
it looks almost ok except i can t make the a1 cell to align right next to a2 on wider screens

purpose,changes,capabilities,use,web,developers,revision,ecma
from the mozilla perspective the purpose of these changes except for adding more capabilities for use by web developers is to lead up to javascript 2.0 that is being developed as the next revision of ecma 262 revision 4 tc39 workgroup

example,oop,perspective
the next example does more or less the same except from an oop perspective

start,previous,invariant,blocks,size,last,slack
in both cases you may also have to shift one or two elements off the start end of some blocks to the end start of the previous next block again at most o n 1 2 times to maintain an invariant that no two blocks differ in size by more than 1 except for the last which is used to take up slack
