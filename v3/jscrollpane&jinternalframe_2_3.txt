smaller, height, jlabel, ---------------------------------------------------

height,bigger
specifically jscrollpane have height bigger than jinternalframe

jlabel,size,smaller
my problem is this i don t want the jlabel or the jscrollpane to stretch to the size of the jinternalframe if the jlabel is smaller than the jinternalframe

others---------------------------------------------------

jtable,nested,issues,scrolling,larger
i ve found that in my jtable which is in a jscrollpane nested in a jinternalframe there can be issues with scrolling and resizing when the jtable was larger than the jscrollpane
