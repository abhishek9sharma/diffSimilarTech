pattern, structure, user-friendly, ---------------------------------------------------

pattern,good,procedure,page,structure
i am getting used to the post redirect get pattern i find it a very good procedure and it also seems to get me thinking more about page structure and not relying on asp.net events too often

pattern,pages,susceptible,resubmitions
note also that in general it is best to follow the pattern of reloading pages with get after post which makes you less susceptible to form resubmitions in which case using sessions for storage is the better solution

web,applications,pattern,user-friendly
at any rate i think web applications that follow the post redirect get pattern are slightly more user-friendly but your mileage may vary

requests, latency, b, ---------------------------------------------------

network,latency,requests,time,first,byte
network latency is ruled out because get requests take more or less same time as local machine whereas time taken to first byte is more for post and put requests

system,b,requests,entries,database
the purpose of the rest api is to a store basic information about the planets in the solar system b allow get requests and c allow me to use post to add more entries in the database

secure, request, data, ---------------------------------------------------

action,better,request,semantic,data,annoyances
an add action like that would be better done as a post request partly for semantic reasons it s sending data rather than get ting it and partly to avoid annoyances like this

broader,application,data,server,purpose
a post has broader application and is generally used to send persistent data to a server in fact prescriptively get should not be used for this purpose

request,suitable
first you make post request although get request is more suitable for search pupposes

request,little,safer,parameters,browser
post request is a little safer than get because the parameters are not stored in browser history or in web server logs

safety,answer,safer
regarding your question about safety -- the answer is post is absolutely no safer than get

data,safer
however post data are not much safer than get data anyway

#2+,calls,request,data,valid,different
the conclusion is remember page #2+ calls are get and the request data that you may have used and were working for post are no more valid creating a different set of conditions now reducing your recordset and creating a total count that may be 0 voiding the pagination system hence the 404

speaking,request,types,requests,better
speaking of get request types you should also know that get requests tend to perform better than post

last,answers,data,secure
last to address other answers while you should use post data when modifying something it is in no way more secure than get

acceptable,properties,data,id
from my understanding it is acceptable to supply less properties in post and upon get you receive more data id auto generated by the server

secure,information,url
post is also more secure than get because you aren t sticking information into a url

standard,request,secure
standard post request is not more secure than get one

slower,bigger,size,request
but generally post is slower and would be bigger in size than a get request

opinion,requests,secure,data
in my opinion post requests are not more secure than get requests and the data can be easily intercepted

parameters,harder
also don t think post parameters are any harder to manipulate than get parameters

request,secure
the get request is marginally less secure than the post request

data
post can send more data than get

data,length
post can hold more data and thus you probably won t get exhausted easily with length of data

worse,security,default,parameters
one reason post is worse for security is that get is logged by default parameters and all data is almost universally logged by your webserver

quicker,step,request,headers,body
get can be quicker compared to post as it is a one step request post sends headers first then the body of the request

use,secure
use post instead of get it s more secure

comparative,table,secure
however in the comparative table i linked get is listed as less secure than post

particular,attack,secure
using post prevents this particular attack but is this actually any more secure than using get

data,use,easier
if your form is meant to create modify data you ll use post instead of get but get is easier to test

use,http,forms,data,url
one big difference links are use http get while forms can use http post thus transferring more data without encoding them to the url as parameters

request,efficient,bear,mind
however a post request is less efficient as a get request - bear that in mind and only use post if you really need to

ajax,request,next,better,browser
what you need to use is an xhr or ajax request to get the next 10 post it is much better to do it this way rather than hiding them and activating them as needed because even if you hide it the browser still had to download the content

requests,secure,visible,url
get requests are less secure because all the parameters are visible in the url while post requests are more secure as they are not shown anywhere in the url

project,security,secure
i am asked to apply to all the actions of one mvc project for security reason says post is more secure than get which i disagree with

khan,answer,secure,riggsfolly
edit taking into account what was said in the comments though it looks more secure and is recommended by w3 see touheed khan s answer post isn t more secure than get and as riggsfolly said

secure
post is not any more secure than get

faster,values,header,request
get is slightly faster because the values are sent in the header unlike the post the values are sent in the request body in the format that the content type specifies

secure,request,parameters
also note that using post is absolutely not more secure than get because the request parameters aren t immediately visible in url

rid,data,bigger
how can i get rid of the post put data getting exponentially bigger

task,details,request,suitable
actually if you would like to retrieve specific task with all its details get request would be more suitable than post

everybody,secure,https
why everybody here is saying post is more secure than get when used over https

misleading,information,safer
and apart from common misleading information where post is safer than get it is not

data,secure
post data isn t inherently more secure than get data

requests,safer
post requests are no safer than restful requests which are no safer than get requests

characters,robust,secure
characters post is more robust and secure than get

minor,easier,ways,request
another reason but rather a minor one is that get is easier to exploit that post as there are more ways to trigger get request than to trigger post request

edit2,wrong,secure
edit2 seems as if i m wrong re post being more secure than get

method,data,secure
please always try to use post method for submitting data as it is more secure than get method

secure,sticking
post is also more secure than get because you aren t sticking

better,size,limitations,length,http,request
post would be the better option though as get has size limitations maximum length of http get request

requests,insecure
get requests are no less insecure than post requests

secure,sense,data,url,request
using post is more secure than get in the sense that data shown into the url in get request but not in post

request,longer,bytes,requests
so if your get request is longer than 255 bytes it s advised to use post requests instead

security,details,secure,comments,details.
after that is done you can go into security details where get is slightly less secure than post - see the comments for details.

data
you can send a lot more data with a post than a get

call,secure
i wouldn t call post more or less secure than get

initial,request,page,subsequent
an initial get request to a page usually costs less than subsequent post anyway so there s not much reason to avoid it

larger,data
post will allow the larger data set and with jquery ajax you should send the data using the data object even if you use get

powelljf3,secure
as powelljf3 said post is more secure then get though it can still be gotten to

request,safer,invulnerable
post request are safer than get but that does not mean are invulnerable

secure
firstly post can seem more secure than get

information,access,token
the post at has more information on how to get that access token

pictures,related,data,first
if the post has more than 9 pictures related to it i only get data from the first 9

requests,secure
i do understand that get requests are less secure but in your scenario your post just doesn t seem to want to work

delegate,methods,request,earlier
i am using custom delegate methods but when i run this the get request is performed earlier than the post so i cannot get the key before the get is done

request,information,able
a post request can include all the information that a get request does plus more which makes it seem like it should be able to do everything get can do plus more

help,information,table
to get more help with that post information about your table structures and content

request,guidelines,restful,api,purpose,data
i don t want to use the get request since it says in the guidelines of a restful api that it should use post for this purpose plus i might want to send more data than get can handle

secure,general,rule,information
it s not any more secure than get but the general rule is that you want get for getting information and post for changing information

method,secure
using the post method isn t necessarily more secure than get

data,values,url
using post allows for more data to be transferred since get will append the values to the url itself

comment,original,information
following my comment on your original post here s some more information that will help you get through this

data,server,privileges
param should be params and therefore your data is not being serialized which would explain why the server is rejecting your post since post requires more privileges than get presumably

secure,false,premise
you can feel like post is more secure than get all you want but it s a false premise

file,uploads,request,verbose
moreover in case of multpart form-data encoding which is required for file uploads but in this case get request is not an option anyway post will be more verbose

unencrypted,connection,secure
on an unencrypted connection post is no more secure than get

capacity,data
post has more capacity it can transfer more data than get

effect,secure
in effect post is no more secure than get

secure
post isn t more secure than get

request,state,thing,data,appropriate
usually though post request are intended to be used for changing the state of the resource on the server so if the only thing you have to do is retrieving data a get is more appropriate

information,arrays,useful,answers
if you edit your post to give some more information as to what is actually in your arrays you might get more useful answers

easier,testing,json,requests
although get may seem easier even for testing purposes for json you should use post requests

body,request,different,fields
here i don t like that the body of the post request contains more different fields then the body returned from the get request - but maybe this is not a problem

little,safer,parameters,browser
post is a little safer than get because the parameters are not stored in browser history or in web server logs. also data is not displayed in the url

secure,ssl,present
although post is more secure as compared to get when ssl is present

aware,better,kind,thing,request
i am aware that a post is better for this kind of thing but my question is is this expected from a get request

secure
hence post is more secure than get

outputs,normal,request
also it seems that my view gets called more than once according to the log outputs and that is normal except it should be a post then redirect to a get but it seems to have more than one post request

request,smaller,websockets,accurate
a get request will be slightly smaller than a post although using websockets would give a more accurate figure

comments,data,appropriate
as suggested in the comments since you are saving data post is more appropriate than get

easier,request
using post would be easier but it will be get request

secure,information
post is more secure than get because you aren t showing information anywhere

note,safer
however note that post is not much safer than get

secure,quick,example
post is more secure than get this is just a quick example

response,request,uri,sensitive,information,better
this response thus assumes that a request using the post verb would not use the uri to transfer sensitive information or it would be no better than get

method,secure,data
post method are generally consume more secure than get because when we use get method than it can display the data in url bar.if the data is more sensitive data like password then it can be inggeris

note,safer,user
note you can also use get but post is safer because the user can t change it in the url

secure,data,transfer
post is more secure then get and data transfer size limits are also there

data,secure,details,query
using post data is more secure than get because with get the details would be in the query string portion of the url

requests,better,problems,little,unsure
i was taught from him that using get requests was better than post but after reading up i would like to switch to post my only problems is i am a little unsure how to modify my code to switch over from get

secure
first off get is no less secure than post

request,method,correct,html,common
be the result of form data probably url_encoded and use the correct request method get is perfectly correct but coming from an html from post is much more common

asynchronous,request,better,user,perception,long
as it s widely known that an asynchronous post request is better since the user won t get a perception that the app has crashed while it s loading the long process

signup,passport,request,ajout-membre
so i m trying to send a formula with ajax before using passport for the signup it was working after using passport the post request to ajout-membre gets redirected to with a get explain more my code

parametres,url,hand,user,secure
when you do get the parametres are written to url so you can access them easily on other hand it can be rewritten by user so post is more secure way

exception,data
with the exception there is more data with the post than the get

supply,data
supply more data upon post and receive less data upon get

request,secure,harder
for example post request are considered more secure than get request as creating a post request is relatively harder than creating a get request

request,server,light,weight,requests
other than that accepting a get request might be - depending on the server side rest framework - slightly more light weight than post requests

stick,action,data,xss-issues
stick with post on any action that does more than get data avoid xss-issues

ajax,request
while your ajax send a get request read more about how to post using ajax and jquery

communicative,intent,request,payload
if you use post when get is more semantically correct it is less communicative of the intent of your request since post usually means you are sending a payload

addition,data,number,size,byte,request,url-encoded
in addition if you have few data to send using get will url-encode the data this means that the number of generated sent bytes will be higher than the data size itself while post will consume more byte in general because the request will additionally contain a content-type application x-www-form-urlencoded header likely a content-length header plus the same url-encoded data as get

requests,data,request,dicey
i understand that get requests are meant to read data while post requests are meant to alter data if a post request is sent more than once dicey things can happen

secure,middle,attacks
post is absolutely not more secure than get as to man in middle attacks

secure,http,protocol
post is no more secure than get over the http protocol

secure,itâ,unencrypted
post is not more secure than get as itâ s also send unencrypted

details, replication, helper, ---------------------------------------------------

details,master-master,replication
another post outlines some more details on this how to get master-master replication with subversion

details,helper,error,message
maybe you can edit your post and provide more details on your helper methods current_user the error message you get with the code above

details,charles,proxy
this post goes into more details how to get charles proxy work with android 7 nougat

url, request, parameters, ---------------------------------------------------

better,passwords,part,url,request,bad
i think whoever said post is better than get when using passwords meant that the passwords would be part of the url in the get request which would obviously be bad

q1.i,better,name-value,pair,parameters,url
q1.i know that post is better than put for name-value pair parameters as the get exposes it in url and post doesn t

form,_server,cleaner,url,parameter
also you can determine if someone is submitting a form or getting the form by checking if _server request_method post which is cleaner than using a get url parameter though i guess there s nothing wrong with the other approach...

pass,parameters,form,url,outside,application,better
however i m not sure you want pass parameters via get if you have a form and url isn t callable from outside of your application post is far better

friendly,short,parameters,request,query,string,url
by doing a redirect-after-post the redirected url which renders the results of your search can be made friendly and short while you can use post to pass more parameters in the request to the server and avoid the long query string associated with the get url

requests,context,complicated,variation,request,arguments,ones,url
post requests can provide a bit more context besides the url but for your question one could argue that they are just a more complicated variation of a get request providing some more arguments besides the ones from the url and in most cases one could turn a post request into a get request with a more elaborated url anyways

query,string,variables,url,data,request,body
usually get is a query string where data is passed through the url with variables appended to the url and post the data is passed through the request body post can pass more data then get

parameters,request,server,side,url,longer
you can also add some get parameters to a post request which are received on the server side as long as the get url is not longer that 1024 bytes

form,request,server,appropriate,values,string,parameters,effect
make the form get not post because the request is not changing anything on the server so get verb is more appropriate and also the get verb will pass all the form values as a query string parameters so you ll get the desired effect

user, easier, safe, ---------------------------------------------------

note,user,logical
note that i am assuming a user can get invited to more than one post which seems logical

easier,developers
using get is much easier than using post for most of developers

safe,seasoned,user
some people say get can be less safe than post -- but to the seasoned user this doesn t make any significant difference because they can intercept and modify headers of the request

users
i want to get all the users that has more than one post but

sandbox,user
you can t get more than 20 post if you are a sandbox user

apache,user,email
btw if you also post the question in apache user email list it might get answered more quickly

user,recent
now i want from all user that have more than 1 post to get all post except the most recent post

tags,user
given the above how would i get a list of all the tags on a given post assuming that more than one user added tags

safe,history
however post is a bit more safe than get because get could be stored in the history

user,record,views,latest_reply.id,bigger
i would like to know how to only get the post that the user either hasn t read at all no record in views or the post latest_reply.id is bigger than the one saved in views

higher,overhead,user,shoulder
post has a higher overhead marginally if we re honest but it all adds up but it doesn t become part of the url so can t be seen by say a casual observer over the user s shoulder - whereas get can

user,value,easier
get would obviously allow for a user to change the value a lot easier than post

users,easier
while users can manipulate post it s far easier to manipulate get

username,user,easier,request.user
but if you want to get the username of the user who makes the post is easier than that you only need to access the request.user

older, version, error, ---------------------------------------------------

older,versions,someone,newest,version
there are lots of post about using older versions but can someone explain why i wouldn t get the newest version

earlier,marked,error,event
note the post that was earlier marked as a duplicate how to get error event details in firefox using addeventlistener

older,version,error
update due to matthew s post i used an older version before but even after updating to 1.6.6 the version i use now i still get an error

commands,older,req.body
curl commands seem to work as do some other post commands from older code but when i log out req.body all i get is

end_date,older
how can i get the post which have end_date older than today

older,package
this post suggests how to get and install an older package release but nhib 3.1 doesn t seem to be available stand alone from nuget

answers, comment, comments, ---------------------------------------------------

answers
what i am trying to figure out is how to get the post that have less than 5 questions and answers together

comments
how can i get all post that have less than 18 comments

comment
basically i need to get all post items having more than 5 comment

blog, steps, output, ---------------------------------------------------

steps,blog,details,output
these steps were taken from this blog post which contains more details about how to investigate and what output you ll get

blog,info
this blog post provides more info to get started

blog,access,token
this blog post explains more on how to get an access token on android

blog,detailed,product
this blog post is more detailed but unfortunately does also not mention where to get the product key

queries,blog,comments
if that s the case how should i make the queries like get me the blog post which have more than 10 comments perform efficiently

better, method, faster, ---------------------------------------------------

ps,exact,faster
ps i know i should use post but it has the exact same problem and i switched back to get to debug it faster

better,url
i think this is better done with a post redirect get so the url can be bookmarked

better,ways
there are i am sure better ways to do the above and i will post here should i get to know more myself

security,better,data,behind-the-scenes
as far as security goes post is much better than get as the data is sent behind-the-scenes rather than embedded in the url making it the typical protocol for login info

ajax,use,simpler,response
if you have the ajax use get rather than post this is simpler then you can test the response by just viewing the page with the appropriate query string

better,blog,api
and your post will be better than you d probably get from using the blog api ymmv but i ve yet to find a compatible editor which did everything in ways i was fully happy with if your use case and expectations are simple though you might well be happy with this module but you should probably not expect it to be very useful for a while

pro,safer,method,example
since i m against get and pro post which is safer method here s an example with post

better,parameters
post would be better and you wouldn t have to hide the get parameters

use,method,limited
and of course use post method instead of get because get is more limited

worse,performance
post has worse performance than get

thread,method,faster
you should check this thread why get method is faster than post

research,better,sooner,solution
i am beginner in transactions and entity manager so i will just continue research to understand it better but maybe i get answer here sooner or if i find the solution i will post it

best,method,database,cat
i m searching for the best method to get result with database contain more than 100000 post and more than 100000 cat

method,faster
it is said that get method is faster than post but i don t know why is it

better,large,unsafer,secure,requests
since post is better suited to transfer large amounts of data or difficult formatted data it is the established standard for submitting forms but it is in no way safer unsafer or more less secure than get requests

better
post is not better than get

note,method,appropriate
note you are using a post method but a get method seems more appropriate in your case getvotes

better,info
however i ve searched for a couple days and am not getting a definitive answer and i need a better understand of this so i know no better way to get more info than to post here

remote,server,better,issues
my questions are am i right to want to use json and use a php file on the remote server that will accept it as get or is post better and what issues should i be aware of when submitting this for review through itunes

better
when post is better than get

https,better
using post over https is better than using get and http

information,better
with more information i get for this i will update this post and make it better i just currently do not know what to call this

better
when get is better than post

able,comments,comment_checking_threshold
i need to be able to get the post that have had more comments than their comment_checking_threshold between their comments_last_checked date and the current date

better,method
get is a better method in this case than post

method,faster
i have seen other people asking the same question why get method is faster than post

better,ajax,string
also post is generally considered better than get for ajax calls as it doesn t have the same string length limit slightly more secure too

info
if i get know some more info i will update this post

fewer,data,method
we can send fewer data with get method compared to post method

faster,better,felix,kling
you won t get it done faster or better as felix kling said in the other post

better,someone
what i am hoping to get from this post is a better way to do this or hopefully someone can tell me why is happening i know that the latter might be hard since it can be a bunch of reasons

brute,force,method,urlroutingmodule,combres.axd
i also found a post that suggests a less brute force method to get the urlroutingmodule to catch the combres.axd route

shorter
generaly get is shorter than post

information
let me know if you get it working if not i ll edit this post to specify more information

better,changes
and no it doesn t need to be post in fact get would be better semantically here because you re not actually making changes to stored data

form,method,password,validation,better
just copy the content of your code in doget to dopost it should work or else set form method get but in case of password validation post is better and write your code for validation in dopost

multipart,data,method,query,put,appropiate
restful services does not implement an exact way to transfer the info you can use path query string form string or even multipart data so you can do it as you want but in your case instead of using get method with all the data in the query a post or put is more appropiate and you will not hit the query string limit

better,data
yes generally post is a better way of submitting data than get

rest,method,better
1 reading other questions about the rest method for this proposes i think that i should use get better than post

better
get is better for some cases but it seems to me you should use post instead

method,illustration,sense,operation
get method is used for illustration here you may find that post makes more sense for this operation

method,requests,actual,data,better
you should not be using the post method for requests that contain no actual data get method is better for that

data,alot,safer,large
when you use post data is a alot more safer than get and you can send large no

comments,method,data,characters
as mentioned in comments use the post method instead of get because post allows much more data characters across in one message

bullet,proof,better
instead i m using post which isn t exactly bullet proof but still a better choice than get in this case

wrong,blog,faster
edit the above is mostly wrong this blog post might get you started faster

unitythread,class,easier,function
first get unitythread class from this post which makes it easier to call a function on the main thread from another thread

quicker,ajax
a get is a bit quicker and than a post in an ajax scenario

parameters,size,better
get parameters are limited in size and post is better suited for this

better,anyways
in this case post may be better than get anyways

better
edit would doing it as a post rather than a get be better

safer
is post safer than get

words,x-http-method-override,header,better
in other words i think post with x-http-method-override get header is better solution

request,better,json
also a post request would be better than a get if you re sending json

parameters,url,better,safer,form,method
i don t recommend sending such parameters via url get it is better and safer if you use post form method

better,data,proxy
yes post is better than get because post data is not usualy logged by a proxy or server but it is not secure

thing,guys,safer,user,data
one more thing some guys would misunderstand that post is safer than get as user can not see the sent data

better,method,user
better than get use post method to send and retrieve user data

better,formatting,specific
i ll get better with formatting and being more specific with the post

ajax,method,faster,proccessing,fields,information
usually in ajax get method is faster as it doesn t involve proccessing post fields and as you are only getting information i would stick it

faster
get is always faster than post

pragmatist,simpler
as a pragmatist i m inclined to use get because implementing it is way simpler than post

method,better,form
is get method is better than post method if you use a form

better
i believe post is better than get

method,safer,data,datas
get method is not safer than post data never trust datas coming from the client side

friendship,method,suits,better
so for creating a friendship post method suits better than get

data,method,better
but i believe sending data using curl with post method is better than get method

indirect,payload,safer
post makes it more indirect to intercept and read the payload than get but not safer

appropriate,method
post would spring to mind but i think get is a more appropriate method because 99 of the time you only supply a bunch of parameters to these types of actions

use,method,login,api,safer
i just want to know if i use post method for login api then is it safer than get method

method,okhttp,slower,httpclient
but the post method okhttp is more slower than httpclient s post always more slower than okhttp s get method

better,redirect,functions,particular
or how is it better than post redirect get if the functions can in fact be used in solving my particular problem

method,useful,data,pages,limitations
the get method is useful for passing a reasonable amount of non sensitive data between pages while the post method has less limitations and is best for more sensitive data

function,better
i already build the function to receive by get but i think via post would be better

better
and i think post is better than get

method,capacity,response,better
because post method storing capacity of response is better than get response

user,unauthorized,better,method
edit based on questioner s comments if modifying a number in a url is all that is required to point to records the user is unauthorized to use would post perhaps be a better method to use than get

faster
i could do a post but get is much faster

use,better
use post instead of get it s better

use,safer,rest
use post its safer than get if you use rest

right,complex,type,better
i d question whether get is the right verb here considering you need to pass a complex type it sounds like it would be better served as a post

faster
get is faster than post

method,faster
why get method is faster than post

data,model,tricky,better
if you have nested data in your model this will soon get tricky to handle though and in that case a post is the better option

better,comments,new,comment
this is better than using get comments api for every post to see if there is new comment

simpler,faster
get is simpler and faster than post and can be used in most cases

better,information
sidenote you are using a post in this case a get would be better since you re retrieving information only

method,forms,calls,safe
while the post method can be submitted with forms or ajax calls and it is pretty safe at least more than the get

amount,data,query,string,method
this means the amount of data you could pass by using post verb is much more than by using a query string and a get method

method,restful,getclientjson
3 imho using method get would be more restful for a method called getclientjson than method post

fine,better,use
i guess post would be also fine but get is always better for our use

data,method,little,harder,simple
although putting data with post method little harder than simple get

content,add,headers,use
however you cannot do anything more than get the content -- you cannot add headers cannot use post

faster,element,suggestions
i used get because is faster than post if you need it just to get a list of element for suggestions

better,side
however it is better to do this on the php side and work more securely with post instead of get

stores,information,pattern,better
for something like a search where you are retrieving information it might be okay but for anything that stores information the post redirect get pattern is a better approach

ddelnado,optimal,better
also as ddelnado mentions get might not be optimal for this post might be better suited

non-url,input,method,appropriate
i can t help with the coding side of your question but if you re passing in a non-url input then the post method would be more appropriate than get

count, similar, tags, ---------------------------------------------------

num_post,count,.filter,tags
i normally use something like this tag.object.annotate num_post count post .filter num_post__gt 2 to get tags with more than 2 post

value,count,sequence,op,rows
based on the op s example count is unique for each id cant group so after grouping by id and cant specify the logical condition for year in i if the first value of count is less than 12 get the sequence as showed in the op s post or else return the sequence of rows assign the output to pond

similar,related,tags
i want to get similar related post that should be matching atleast 3 tags all post have more then 10 tags

similar,queries,links,issues
rather than try and regurgitate the discussion based on similar queries i will post some links here that should get you thinking more about these issues

info, mapping, users, ---------------------------------------------------

mapping,info,response
post your mapping info and one of response s hit you do not want to get may help more

page,users,info
what i m trying to get is a page that displays 20 users per page will have pagination with the fallowing info it should show only users that have more than 2 post published

body, idempotent, character, ---------------------------------------------------

performant,idempotent,message,body
get is more performant as it is idempotent and does not contain a message body where as post does

faster,encapsulation,character,limit,body
the get is usually faster because it has no encapsulation sends data via url usually with a 255 character limit as post exists encapsulation by being sent by the body of the http request

things, type, sorry, ---------------------------------------------------

unsecure,type,datatransactions,searchform,secure,things
get is more often used on unsecure type of datatransactions like for example a searchform and post is used when you want to make more secure things like a login form

sorry,information...,type,given--,helpful,things,comments
sorry that this post is more of the and for further information... type than a direct answer which i think has now been given-- i just thought it was helpful not to get things lost inside comments

sense, static, specific, ---------------------------------------------------

sense,specific
i know using post would make more sense but i am using get for specific reasons

sense,static
that would mean i d need to do a post rather than a get though get makes more sense when i m just getting some static data right

important, functions, https, ---------------------------------------------------

https,important
for security http vs https is more important than post vs get

functions,important
however if you want to get more than one post rather use functions mentioned above i think the most important thing is to grab them in one db query and not in ineffective way one-by-one

second, link, simple, ---------------------------------------------------

opinion,second,thats,ecure,opinion.it,easier
in my opinion the second way to achieve this is better because using get is not thats ecure in my opinion.it s easier than using post

simple,examples,requests,documentation,http-on-modify-request,complicated
there are simple examples 1 2 for intercepting get requests in the documentation for http-on-modify-request however intercepting post requests is more complicated

page,actions,simple,ids,complex,models
each page would have 2 actions a get that takes simple ids and a post which takes more complex models

point,view,forgery,easier,first,link,second
from a hacker s point of view a get forgery is much easier than post forgery at the first you only post a link at the second you need to point to a malware website with hidden iframe and autosubmit forms but both of them fail if tokens are checked

page,second,record,pagination,link,values,model
i think the problem is when the page is loading to get second record from database when the pagination link is selected post values are no more passing to model page so might be the problem

strings, reality, restful, ---------------------------------------------------

reality,longer,strings
in reality the post are much longer but the strings simply get cut off

restful,strings
however neither post nor get alone are more or less restful - both are strings of data just in slightly different parts of the request

error, help, exception, ---------------------------------------------------

error
or in case there are less than 5 post you will get an error

exception,help
also if you could post the exception you get could be from more help to find what s happening with your code

error
when i want to get more than 54 post i receive this error

number, amount, smaller, ---------------------------------------------------

posts_per_page,nothing,query
i know there can be problems with posts_per_page but nothing is working i ve searched a lot to get the query to display more than one post

final,note,larger,amount,information
one final note post can transmit a larger amount of information than get

server,logs,ping,pages,smaller,amount
because in my server logs it s showing a lot of post with million of ping while the other pages have been get is a smaller amount of number

response,number,smaller,query
i don t understand why if i count the number of items in the 2nd response the number of post is smaller than the number of post i get from 1st query

topics,number,x,greater
basically it equates the number of topics to the number of post so i always get x topics and x post if post is greater than 0

requests, maximum, fake, ---------------------------------------------------

requests,larger,maximum
post requests can be much larger than get requests as get requests are limited by the maximum length of a url

requests,time
in your case since get requests take far less time to go around than post requests that s why they re completing first

requests,smaller,limits,specs
get requests have smaller limits than post in the specs

requests,fine,trickier
so you can implement get or head requests just fine but post requests are trickier

requests,complex,ones,parser
post requests are much more complex that get ones so the parser lies in a separate package body-parser

requests,harder,fake,nice
post requests are harder to fake compared to get requests so you have that going for you which is nice

requests,lightweight,high,load
more over it seems that get requests are more lightweight than post under high load

compact,requests,url-encoded
is post more compact than get since get requests have to be url-encoded

requests,restrictive,size,limitations
get requests have more restrictive size limitations than post requests

idea, good, lower, ---------------------------------------------------

data,server,good,idea,lower,limit
generally when passing lots of data to the server to be processed or stored using post is a good idea since get has a lower limit than that of post

example,secure,good,idea,attack
it is just an example that shows a scenario in which get is more secure than post but i don t think it would be a good idea to choose get over post from this attack reason

able, single, likes.how, ---------------------------------------------------

able,single,rest
not able to get more than 100 post in single rest api call for the linkedin company updates

able,likes,post.the,likes.how
i m able get only 1000 likes of the post.the post contain more than 1000 likes.how can i get all the likes

users, user-agents, standpoint, ---------------------------------------------------

solution,variables,trickier,users
here s the solution for post variables as well which is probably trickier for more users than the get solution

standpoint,user-agents,difficult,different,users
from an interface design standpoint you want user-agents to make post and put and delete more difficult than get or at least distinctly different so that users can rely on that difference to hint when their actions might cause a change in the resource state because they are responsible for those changes

able, ones, author, ---------------------------------------------------

able,flag,obvious,ones,helpful
i actually like that having got the gold flag weight badge i m able to flag the problem post that are less obvious - the ones that 9 times out of 10 get marked as helpful but occasionally get disputed

able,database,result,author,objects,ones
i m able to query my database below to get the result that i want but i don t want to have to iterate through all of the author objects just the ones that have more than one post

category, categories, ones, ---------------------------------------------------

category
i get somehow category repeated if it has more than 1 post eg

categories,ones
i try it and i get all the categories and not just the ones with more than 1 post in them

appropriate, base, things, ---------------------------------------------------

appropriate,queries,safe
get is more appropriate than post for queries because of its safe semantics

base,appropriate
on that base a get is more appropriate then a post

appropriate,things
however using get rather than post is typically more appropriate for things like this where you are only selecting different options rather than changing data on your server

complicated, complex, ---------------------------------------------------

complicated
if you re just handling get then you can just look for n n but handling post will require something more complicated

complex
post is a little more complex than get though

request, data, errors, ---------------------------------------------------

shares,field,request,post_id,sharedposts,empty,data
when i request the shares field i can see more than one post with shares but when i request post_id sharedposts for some of them i just get an empty data array in response

method,errors,request,route,ajax,call,data,important
i only know method not allowed errors from a get request to a post route but that s not the case as ajax is performing a post call though there is some get data attached and more important it s working on localhost

limit, 2mb, several, ---------------------------------------------------

default,limit,method,2mb,higher
there is a default limit of post method which is 2mb which is way higher than get

size,limit,smaller
you ll hit problems with larger submissions and file-uploads as the size limit for a get is much smaller than a post

limit
so is it enough only to use limit to get more than 50 post

event,longer,limit,several
in the event that a get must be longer than that limit several people have suggested that it s ok to use a post instead

last, mode, share, ---------------------------------------------------

sandbox,mode,last
first of all if your instagram client is in sandbox mode then you can t get more than 20 post more clearly last 20 post

last,share,page,superpoints
if the last 100 post have more than one share from the page he get ranked up or some superpoints

suitable, inserts, ---------------------------------------------------

suitable,inserts
where 404 may be suitable for get and put update but less suitable for post inserts

suitable
while using get isn t that pretty in this case post could be more suitable you could do this

field, table, columns, ---------------------------------------------------

field,page,likes,records,time
the problem i am having is that there isn t a timestamp field that i can use to page with and some post have way more than 5000 likes 5000 being the most records you can get at one time

field,table,scheduled_date,equal,current
there is a field in the post table named scheduled_date which i will get the post that are less than or equal to the current date

policy,rid,extra,column,tableview,columns
i am setting the policy to constrained-resize to get rid of the extra column based on this so post tableview has more columns than specified

mysql,select,query,table,secs,records
i need some advice on how to get the mysql to respond to a select query from post table within 3 to 4 secs post have more than 1 million records

like_count,integer,field,users
and each post have a like_count integer field i want to get users along their post that has more that n post which is liked more that m times i do

table,columns,unique,post_type,relevant
you can of course have only one table aka post and keep adding more columns that are unique for each post_type where they get filled in if relevant

api, tumblr, instagram, ---------------------------------------------------

tumblr,api,time
however it isn t clear how much the value can be for the standard tumblr api you can t get more than 50 post at a time

instagram,api
how to get more than 20 post from instagram using their api

restful, serialization, huge, ---------------------------------------------------

restful,services,methods,ones,complicated
i managed to create simple restful services with get methods but i can t imagine creating post ones being much more complicated

serialization,http,requests,restful,simpler,huge
this would make things considerably easier as the android library has native support for json serialization and making http get requests to restful urls is much simpler than http post requests it s not a huge deal but just less stuff you have to worry about

amount, data, candidate, ---------------------------------------------------

limitation,amount,login,password,data,visible,bar
get has limitation of amount when submitting data safe to use up to 2000 characters ie s limit and is visible to address bar of the browser and not being used for login password and post can send more data than get and also not visible to address bar

limit,amount,data,smaller,semantic,difference,good,candidate
get is basically just like post it just has a limit on the amount of data you can send which is usually a lot smaller than post and a semantic difference which makes get not a good candidate from that point of view even if technically they both can do it

easier, button, checks, ---------------------------------------------------

look,easier,radio,button
have a look at this post it is probably easier to get the selected radio button by changing your itemscontrol to use a listbox with the existing datatemplate

user,value,easier,suitable,checks
get would obviously allow for a user to change the value a lot easier than post so suitable checks for existance and ownership of the record would be important

others---------------------------------------------------

blog,heap,space,symptom,unable,dex
as per the blog post to give eclipse more heap space symptom is â you get unable to execute dex java heap spaceâ edit eclipse.ini with something like

common,mis-conception,secure,obvious,browser,variable
there appears to be a common mis-conception that post is more secure than get simply because it seems more obvious how to get a browser to manipulate the post variable

length,parameter,longer,bytes,g-wan
i noticed once the length of a get parameter is longer than 400 bytes or 2000 bytes for a post parameter g-wan returns 400 error

title
what i want is to get all post which contains 20 less in the title


when i try to get more than 100 post it returns

wait,time,long,larger,issue
the usual wait time of the post is not too long not too larger than get so i don t think that should be an issue and post always gets back with a 200

project,set,comments,comment,threshold,date
i m working on a project where i have a set of post a post has many comments and i want to get all the post that have had more comments than the post comment threshold in the post comment date range

fix
it seems that a lot of people have been confused by this post and started asking more and more to get the mentioned above fix

types,type,little,variation
the problem is that some post types have way more post than others so i want to show only 3 post per post type to get a little variation in the loop

note,values,var,wich,sense,form
note that doing this will get the values via post var instead get wich makes more sense since you are sending via post your form

patent,prior,art
you can t get a patent any more because with this post i will claim prior art -

request,appropriate,good,practice,bookmarkable,page-to-page
but do also remember that in your case get request looks more appropriate and as balusc says its not good practice to use post for bookmarkable page-to-page navigation

ing,ajax,likely
also try post ing using ajax as get is much more likely being cached

bigger,state,objective,approach,job,done...and,expert,opinion.
i know my post became slightly bigger but i tried to state clearly my objective and my approach to get the job done...and to get expert opinion.

susceptible,websites,attacker,arbitrary,request,ways,arbitary,automatic
the only scenario in which post is slightly less susceptible is that many websites that arenâ t under the attackerâ s control say a third-party forum allow embedding arbitrary images allowing the attacker to inject an arbitrary get request but prevent all ways of injecting an arbitary post request whether automatic or manual

book,blog,better,simple,example,horse,mouth
if you are curious though rather than just trusting a book or a blog post it is better to make a simple example and take it apart - you get it straight from the horse s mouth and you learn a whole lot more

best,answer,input,look,comments,printf,results
please note this is the best answer you can get without providing more input look at the comments to your post what are your printf results

com_id,eve.com_id,multiple,result
if you have more than one post with the same com_id in eve.com_id you will get multiple post in your result

tidy,refreshing,issues,method,thing
maybe i would mostly always choose post over get it s more tidy and refreshing and going back issues with post method are a thing from the past in any major browser they just ask you if you want to resend the data don t they

points,answer,requests,useful,certain
all good points however in answer to the question get requests are more useful in certain scenarios over post requests


i get far more than 50 post

pinoyyd,neater,straight,point
the pinoyyd post is neater and get straight to the point how do i authorise a background web app without user intervention

search,form,use,requirements,forms,usable,accessible
first i would suggest making your search form to use get not post of course this will depend on use cases and requirements but search forms should use get to make them more usable accessible

feed,facebook,max,subattachments,image
to get the feed of facebook api but it only returns max 12 subattachments while the post include more 12 attached image

several,results,faster,lighter
i run the ab test several times with same results post is faster but get is lighter

site
i ve looked through other people s questions on this site but it still isn t getting through to me so i thought i d post my code and get an answered more tailored to what i m doing

blame,incorrect,hours,response
i agree to get any blame here for such incorrect using of the sending post and waiting for more then 2 hours for response

.parse,function,newer,days
i basically know zilch of java but i m hoping someone can help me put something into that .parse function that would get me post that have dateupdated newer than 5 days

level,protection,token
but using post instead of get presumably adds one more level of protection for xsrf types of attack it does not you need some form of explicit xsrf protection token with post or with get

clearer,beginner
you could use post here as well but get will be clearer as a beginner and refreshing won t invoke the browser s submit form again dialogue

indepth,var_dump,last,checkbox
i know this has been covered indepth in other post but i can t get my var_dump of post to print out more than the last checkbox that is checked

look,string,memorystrea,memorystream
have a look at this post to read more about getting a string from a memorystrea how do you get a string from a memorystream

rid,annoying,paypal,website,important,data
to get rid of the annoying warning it might help to tell paypal to return to your website using get instead of post and send less of the important data back

cloudinary,direct,accepts_nested_attributes_for,images
i m trying to get cloudinary direct uploads working on a rails app using carrierwave and accepts_nested_attributes_for to submit one or more images with a post

information,stronger,user,json,infos,request,page
one way that you can consider for hide information not totally but more stronger than get of user is create a json with your infos and send a post request to your page

note,repetition,category
please note however that you may still get some repetition if a post is assigned to more than one category

go,functionality,smaller,recreatable
give the resources a read have a go at implementing the functionality you need and if you get stuck post smaller recreatable problems with the code you have written

anyone
anyone knows how to bypass this problem and get more than 100 post

options,timeout,short,time,possible,dialog,annoying,flash
additional options are to show this via a timeout so it s only shown when the post takes more than a short time and to use some form of fadein not sure if possible with a dialog then you don t get the annoying flash on the times it s very quick

attachment,entries
for now if post have more than one attachment i get n entries back.

request,safety,half-decent,debugging,tool,requests
a post request would not provide any more safety than a get request any half-decent web debugging tool can forge post requests

data,body,cookies,urls,length,secure,part
get is basically for just getting retrieving data a get should not have a body so aside from cookies the only place to pass info is in the url and urls are limited in length get is less secure compared to post because data sent is part of the url

hope,clarification
hope you get the more clarification by this post

bytes,reliable
if you re transfering more than about 512 bytes then using post rather than get should prove more reliable


post has a lot more advantages than get

client,scores,highscore,problems,simple
the client post scores and fetches highscore lists from the server and everything seemed to be working perfectly we had been testing it for a month with no problems and the code is really simple with not much more than a put get

finding,work,worth
i ended finding that post was more work than it s worth and that you could accomplish the same with get

loads,callback,newer,page
i have tried doing the same request as when the page loads when this callback occurs and get the post that are newer than those already on the page

shader,objects,camera,view,image,effect
because your not going to get that using a shader like this by itself because as it stands it will only apply to objects like your plane but not the full camera view that requires a post image effect

helpful,negative
if you find this fix helpful then please do up-vote the question such that it doesn t go in negative so that the post doesn t get closed and more people may get help

fix,quick,correct
eventually i went back to post because we needed the fix quick but it has been bugging me because semantically a get is more correct in this case

help,real,effort,complicated,things
if you post for help on questions that can be resolved yourself without any real effort you re doomed when you get exposed to more complicated things


is there anything more i should do more than changing post to get

term,sidebar,repeat
i have links of term on sidebar when i attach more than one post to term it get repeat

second,.net,larger,maxrequestlength,http,module,portion
to answer part of your second question with .net if the post is larger than maxrequestlength part of the .net configuration but smaller than maxallowedcontentlength part of the iis configuration you can create a custom http module to get at the portion of the post that came through

user,open,new,older,change,client,side
now next time user open app it will show post and will get any new post or fetch more older post but there is no way it can detect a change in one of the post that it already have in client side

legacy,harder,struts2
legacy way would be to use post redirect get harder way on struts2 would be using the token interceptor but if you aren t target old browser just do like that

time,calls,requests,overhead,traffic
generally i ve read many time you should do ajax calls as get requests not post because post produces more overhead and traffic

years,blog,relatedfieldwidgetwrapper,popup,next,foreign
i have followed modified code that dan gentry wrote years back in his blog post titled more relatedfieldwidgetwrapper â my very own popup to get the + sign next to foreign keys and figured out a way to load them to the next page my problem is i do not know how to back out of a chain of these

higher,id
that means - get all the post that have higher id than the current one

form,preferable,search
posting your form with get instead of post would be more preferable in case of search form as u wont need to maintain any session and no need of storing values in database also

query,results,stackexchange,reputation,users,body,user
i need a query to get results from stackexchange dataset in such a way that it returns me 100 top reputation users with not more than 3 post body of post for each user

better,performance,webservers,contents,temporary
get may yeild marginally better performance some webservers write post contents to a temporary file before invoking the handler

order_children,entries,menu,categories,overwritten
when timber calls order_children duplicate entries post belonging to more than one of the menu categories get overwritten

resource,fields
that is the resource returned on a get had less fields than the one passed on a post

ajax,performant
ajax calls using get are more performant than post according to yahoo

recent,reply,replies,created_on,value,post_id,subject
if a post has a more recent reply i want to get the replies created_on value but also get the post post_id and subject

letter,compact
post has one more letter in it than get so it s less compact

new,thread
this is what i ended up settling on using i will upvote and welcome all new post in this thread that get this done with less code

sensitive,data,query,string,custom,headers,sense
the reason to use post for sending sensitive data is that it prevents data leakage via the query string although another way would be to use get with custom headers set although post makes much more sense

shorter,basic,test,workouthandler
i have simplified the app so the post is shorter but the basic problem is that if i get test in workouthandler - it cannot recognize methods in wardenstrategies or loginhelper unless i also include those files in the handler they are already included in app.rb

character,doubt,performance
other than the fact that get has one character less than post i doubt there is any performance difference

samples,events,specific,example
post some samples of how your events are wired up and i get give a more specific example

maxdocs,incremental,solr,sooner
also after you are done with your bulk import reduce maxtime and maxdocs so that any incremental post you will do to solr will get committed much sooner

various,methods,patch,head
given http supports various methods like get put post delete and more like patch head options etc

better,read-only,richer,sort,warnings
sometimes get is a better option in those read-only scenarios because it makes your url scheme richer and avoids these sort of post warnings

updated_at,default,first,visitor,loads,longer,time,subsequent,benefits,caching
caching with an activerecord object creates a key that includes updated_at by default so if a post changes the first visitor that loads the post will have a longer wait time and every subsequent visitor will get the benefits of caching

parameter
in this way is if the parameter arrives by post or via get the withdraw more

ajax,requests,ajaxoption,httpmethod,fragile,actionlink
basically ie sometimes caches ajax get requests so setting the ajaxoption s httpmethod to post is a less fragile way to construct an actionlink

part,life,easier,understanding,two-way
the part life before binding in this post was easier for me to get the understanding of how two-way binding can be created

pointers,love,slower
any pointers would be appreciated i d love to get this working as you can imagine doing the post synchronously is considerably slower than asynchronously

script,input,request,address,img,src,desirable,elegant
obviously i could script each input into a get request address and replace the img src with that but post is more desirable and it seems there should be a more elegant way to make use of the form s submit mechanism

vulnerable
get is more vulnerable than post as it can be transmitted and stored

result,earlier,.js,file,error,plugin
the problem i have noticed is that sometimes the jquery post result is retrieved earlier than the load of the .js file has been completed so i get an error and of course the jquery plugin doesn t work

onload,script,purpose,data,reasonable
but for my personally preference any default state should be done before hand and not the in the script for example initiate your radio dom element to have checked property and then onload script call the post directly anyway post is not designed for this purpose just imagine post as to save something if you just want to get query some data get would be more reasonable

friends,couple,name,picurl
if i need to display one 1 friends post i can do this simply but when there are couple of friends with more than 1 post i can t get the name and picurl of the user and it displays null in json response

perfect,query,left,jon,comments,table,comment_date,result,null,post_date,greater,date
give it a try works perfect for me what it is doing query get the all the post with a left jon with comments table so when a post has comment them n it also has the comment_date if no comments posted on the post then in result set it will be null so i have merged the comment_date with post_date so which post has the greater date for comment_date or post_date it will first and so on

instances,subject,csrf
in some instances accepting a get rather than a post could make you more subject to a csrf attack

eps,situation,script,readable,transformations,object,size
for eps is the same situation the post script is more readable but you should apply all necessery transformations on object before get its size

blog,earlier,interaction,product,name,state
the blog post i mentioned earlier says it s more about interaction did the product name get added rather than state

logical
but a get seems more logical than a post anyway

django,forms,instance,appropriate
i know django forms uses post but in this instance i feel that get is more appropriate which means i don t have to use django forms but does that mean i also don t have to validate the data

operators,better,feeling,nigerian,users
it seems some operators do better with post s than get s - this is a feeling i get from what some nigerian users mention

thing
however there s one thing we haven t considered yet - what if you never get more than 5 post

support,resources,faster,response,third,party
we provide a number of support resources which may get faster response than post on third party sites including the virtuoso users mailing list public support forums and confidential support cases

blog,subject,django,project,github,start,point
i have a blog post explaining more about the subject as well as i have created a django blank project in github so you can get that to have a start point of your project using vagrant

type,faster,cause,curious
is type get faster than type post cause i am curious how both work

sketch,ideas,interested,group,hands,dirty
try to sketch out your ideas post somewhere find more people interested assemble a group and get your hands dirty

frequent
get and head being much more frequent than post

ideas
this post is more to get advises and ideas rather than solving a problem

none,comments,hand
none of the post have more than 10 comments so it wouldn t get out of hand

access,logged-in,users,specific,user,share,user_status,unable
and if i want to get access to logged-in users post to be more specific post that user share from my fanpage is there any other workaround because i have tried using user_status and unable to get it work

data,new,reddit,limitation
i have been trying get data out of new reddit post but theres limitation where you cant get data from more than 100 post

elegant,options,development
i think using post is more elegant and has more options for further development than passing them via get

mike,brent,wide,open,abuses,recommendation,better
2 as mentioned by mike brent get is wide open to easy and simple abuses but while his recommendation of post is better it s still open to abuse unless appropriate measures are taken see 3 below

earlier,user,small,div,invalid,argument
this ties to another post i had earlier basically when the user clicks a link a script is loaded into the big div the big div which contains the smaller div later on i need to reload the smaller div but it requires variable available only in the big div and i cannot include them in the small one for other reasons basically the script works when you load everything at once but when you try to dynamically load the small div i get a invalid argument supplied error here is how my code structure

options,dosn,string,length,negative,slower,couple
post gives you more options and dosn t have a limit on parameter query string length like get the only negative is post is slower by a couple of milliseconds to create the request

usual,tagging,objects,tag,tags,applications
usual way with tagging is to get objects by tag but if tags are used by few applications it may give more than post

today,yesterday
but if today post is less than 10 post i will get back the yesterday post to query

larger,files
you could use a post instead of a get to allow larger files and be semantically correct

appropiate,idempotent,queries,action
get is more appropiate for idempotent queries while post is more appropiate for action queries but you can shoot yourself in the foot just as easily with any of them if you don t understand the security architecture for the application you re maintaining

system,box,larger
so i have a post system and i want the box to get larger as more post come in

deeper,pre,incrementors
i m trying to get deeper with post and pre incrementors but am a bit stuck with the following expression

shipping,longer,call,alert,session
the problem is that the post shipping takes longer than the call get alert then shows me the session variable not updated

book,http
type book why do we need anything more than http get put post

swagger,list-without-search,list+search,page,documentation,latter
i resorted to split the two in swagger list-without-search as get and list+search as post just to put the page in the swagger documentation also if the latter actually works also as get

work,emails,alternative,easier,hacks
i m sure there s a work around to use get for emails but the alternative post is much more easier and doesn t require any hacks to get around

date,count
so it is considerably less then what facebook states in their documentation at least looking by the date however by count it seems you get more than 50 post

image,pil,earlier,fourier,images,function
i have just done some image processing using the python image library pil using a post i found earlier to perform fourier transforms of images and i can t get the save function to work


added just so this post doesn t get down-voted any more -

whole,database,id,mood,grumpy,easier,answer
while you don t get the whole post you do still have to query the database for the id of post with mood grumpy so unless you have lots of post it s probably easier to just go with the answer dorel gave

content,blog,test,posts...,height,widgets,larger
for example on the blog page of my current project i have two widgets in the sidebar one for latest tweets and one for latest music news however as you can see on this page the content of the blog post all test posts... are much longer than the height of the two widgets and would of course get larger as more post are added

original,nature,test,point,numbers,set,conditions
the scenario that came up in the original post was due more to the nature of the test and the author s not realizing how floating point numbers get rounded displayed than due to a set of conditions that might come up in the real world to cause problems with code when using np.where

first,overflow,today,expert
this is my first post on stack overflow i want to get involved into more php that is the reason i got started today i will need more expert help in the future

size,restrictions,configurable,setting,higher,end,request
gets have a size restrictions post do not or at least it s a configurable setting on the server and has a larger higher end than a get request would

zheyuan,interesting,experiments,results
adding on top of zheyuan s interesting post did some more experiments to see that we can get the same results with intercept as well as follows

currenlty,divs,large,space,bigger
i m currenlty putting each post in a but this just stacks all of the divs and i get a large space between post which are bigger


you can also chose to get more than 25 post at once

issues,github,issue,repository,help,better
and if you find yourself with more issues after this post i check my github daily so logging an issue against my repository will get more help in a better place for a back and forth

sense,slower,caller,notification,agent,value,queue
i think i generally agree with your summary - it makes sense that postandasyncreply is slower than post so if the caller doesn t need to get a notification from the agent when the operation such as putting value into the queue completes it should definitely expose a way to do that using just post

grateful,somebody,correct,syntax,example,function
i would be really grateful if somebody could post the correct syntax firstly so i can get it working and more importantly so i can work through a working example to understand what the function is actually doing
