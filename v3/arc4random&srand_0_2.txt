better,random,rand,seed
from what i can gather arc4random generates much better random numbers than rand does however i haven t seen a way to seed it and i would like to just like using srand

results,stable,iterations,rand,longer
results are quite stable srand and 999999999 iterations of rand takes around 6 s while arc4random takes much longer around 30 s
