greater, return, nothing, ---------------------------------------------------

addition,rectangular,calculation,cheaper
addition subtraction for the rectangular bound calculation is cheaper than multiplication

operations,faster,division
subtraction operations and usually significantly faster than multiplication and division

operations,addition,harder,division,slower
for floating point operations addition and subtraction are harder than multiplication and division so they may be slower or not again it depends on how much transistor real estate there is dedicated to the fpu

division,higher,precedence,addition,extraneous,parentheses
finally we all know that multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction so we can remove the extraneous parentheses so this turns into

addition,division
the addition and subtraction are much more than multiplication and division

basics,division,higher,addition,esoteric
i know the basics division and multiplication higher than addition and subtraction but i would have to look up something more esoteric

intuition,addition,faster,division,correct
the intuition would say addition subtraction are faster than multiplication division but is that really correct

division,modulo,precedence,addition
multiplication division and modulo have the same precedence and they all have higher precedence than addition and subtraction

division,remainder,higher,precedence
remember multiplication division and remainder operators are all higher precedence than subtraction

return,addition,division,testing
it is also possible to manipulate the inputs so that various parts of the calculation return 0 for addition or subtraction or 1 for multiplication or division to make testing easier but this only gets me so far

division,slower,addition,c#,version
i don t understand why the division multiplication in c++ is so much slower than addition subtraction where the managed c# version is more reasonable to my expectations

higher,precedence,addition
multiplication has higher precedence than addition subtraction

division,higher,precedence,addition,parentheses
division multiplication has higher precedence than addition subtraction and parentheses is required to do addition subtraction before multiplication division

operations,addition,faster,integer,division
typically operations like addition and subtraction are much faster in integer -- multiplication and division less so

division,operators,precedence,addition,scientific,notation
multiplication and division operators have higher precedence than addition and subtraction in c++ same as in scientific notation

division,higher,priority,addition
multiplication and division have higher priority than addition and subtraction

division,higher,precedence,addition
multiplication and division have a higher precedence than addition and subtraction

precedence,addition,operators,division,higher
this is happening because the concatenation operator has a higher precedence than the addition or subtraction operators but multiplication and division have a higher precedence then concatenation

expensive,addition,division
multiplication is more expensive than addition subtraction and division is more expensive still

addition,division
apart from that multiplication is addition done more than once and division is subtraction done more than once

natural,precedence,division,greater,addition
i don t think they have a natural precedence unlike say multiplication and division being of greater precedence than subtraction and addition because they can be built from subtraction and addition

division,precedence,sum
indicates that multiplication and division have more precedence than sum and subtraction

variation,division,addition
in general you ll have more variation with multiplication and division than with addition and subtraction

integer,division,modulo,addition
integer multiplication division and modulo are much slower than integer addition and subtraction

division,higher,precedence,addition
to start with i need multiplication and division to take higher precedence than addition and subtraction

nothing,rule,division,precedence,addition
nothing follows the rule of multiplication and division having more precedence over addition and subtraction

longer,single-precision,division,addition
the term is apparently not an exact measurement as it is clear that a double-precision floating-point operation is going to take longer than a single-precision one and multiplication and division are going to take longer than addition and subtraction

numeric,expression,higher,precedence,addition
either way your example with the numeric expression would multiplying by 3 first because multiplication has higher precedence than addition or subtraction

others---------------------------------------------------

unary,priority,lower
in t-sql unary minus is made to be the same priority as subtraction which is lower than multiplication

rule,grammar,division,operations,tree,addition
notice that by making the rule for contain the rule for this grammar makes sure all multiplication division operations occur lower in the parse tree than any addition subtraction

similar,base,type,additions,slow,division,trickier,numbers,long
subtraction is similar using subtraction of the base type and borrow instead of carry multiplication can be done with repeated additions very slow or cross-products faster and division is trickier but can be done by shifting and subtraction of the numbers involved the long division you would have learned as a kid

matrix,algorithm,efficient
after much fuddling with the sparse matrix algorithm i realized that distributing the multiplication over the subtraction was dramatically more efficient

higher,precedence,digit,character
since multiplication has a higher precedence than subtraction you should subtract 0 to your digit character before multiplying it

costlier,right
in general multiplication is more costlier than subtraction right

complex,addition
i don t know how it works but it s much more complex than addition subtraction or even multiplication

title,faster,example
as in title why is multiplication much faster than subtraction in this example

addition,lower,latency
addition and subtraction are slightly lower latency multiplication is the same

calculator,division,highest,priority,time,addition,lower
put each token +- of final command string in a list maybe a binary tree works and sort that list to tell the calculator that division and multiplication has the highest priority in the mean time addition and subtraction has lower priority

higher,values
while multiplication normally works subtraction fails for higher values

operator,second,higher,precedence
this subtraction operator occurs within the second brackets and so has a higher precedence than the multiplication

slower
multiplication is slower than subtraction

arithmetic,expensive,division,powers,dividion,exponent,addition,range
it will be much slower i don t have benchmarks but i would guess at least an order of magnitude maybe more decimal will not benefit from any hardware acceleration and arithmetic on it will require relatively expensive multiplication division by powers of 10 which is far more expensive than multiplication and dividion by powers of 2 to match the exponent before addition subtraction and to bring the exponent back into range after multiplication division

higher,precedence
the only way it would be broken up differently would be if addition had a higher precedence than subtraction like multiplication does
