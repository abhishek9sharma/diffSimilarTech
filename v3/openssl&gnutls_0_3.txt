usability,api,time,preferable
speaking about usability personally i would prefer gnutls api but at the time openssl looks more preferable to use

similar,gutmann,cryptlib,gnu
openssl is more similar to peter gutmann s cryptlib and gnu s gnutls

newer,better
i ve generally gone with openssl though gnutls is newer perhaps better
