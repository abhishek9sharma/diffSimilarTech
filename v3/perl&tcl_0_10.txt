style,previous,real,alien,seasoned,developers
hence the code style you adopted actually tries to make tcl code look more like python or perl or whatever was your previous language for no real value and also look alien to seasoned tcl developers

django,html5,twig,smarty,node.js,templatetoolkit
supports javascript mason xbl xul rhtml scss python html ruby python3 xml sass xslt django html5 perl css twig less smarty node.js tcl templatetoolkit php

better,regex,performance,bad
i know that perl performs better for some regex but will the tcl performance really be this bad in comparison

faster,dynamic,slower
in fact in my experience php is faster than any dynamic language i have benchmarked it against - python perl ruby tcl are all slower performing than php

simpler,family,difficult
it is written in tcl which is a language somewhat simpler than perl but broadly in the same family and not difficult to learn

verbose
tcl is more verbose than perl here

syntax,related,bash,tcsh
while tcl syntax looks more related to shell syntax like bash or tcsh tcl is actually more closely related to perl or php or ruby

arrays,closer,dict,hash
tcl arrays are closer to what python calls a dict and a hash in perl

worse,regard,basic
tcl is no better nor worse than perl ruby python or any other scripting language in this regard -- they all do basic file operations with equal aplomb

easier,matthew,scharley
tcl might be easier to embed than perl but i do have to agree matthew scharley s reasoning
