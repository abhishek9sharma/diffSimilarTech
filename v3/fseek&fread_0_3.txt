data,useless,bytes,kb
you fseek to offset x whatever data is buffered is now useless you fread 100 bytes and the buffered fread reads more - probably 8 kb

faster
so i guess fseek should be much faster than fread

faster,changes,pointer
i probably feel fseek might be bit faster than fread as fseek changes the pointer position to the new address space that you have mentioned and there is no date read is happening
