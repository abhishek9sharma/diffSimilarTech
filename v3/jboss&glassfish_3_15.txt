production, deployments, alternative, ---------------------------------------------------

better,j2ee,server
i think glassfish is a better j2ee app server to start with than jboss

ee,server,better,alternative
but if you want a full-fledged java ee 6 server then glassfish 3 or jboss 6 is a better alternative

afaik,production,deployments,better
afaik jboss is much more adopted in production deployments than glassfish but this doesn t necessarily mean it s better

others---------------------------------------------------

right,weblogic,business-bean-classes
well glassfish is more right than jboss and weblogic business-bean-classes should all have their own ejb-local-interface

easier
i tried jboss too but i think glassfish is easier to use

containers,complex,alternative,nested,transactions
many containers such as jboss provide more complex alternative transaction managers which support concepts like nested transactions but others like glassfish do not

larger,community
jboss has a larger community than glassfish

opinion,user,friendly,use,project
in my opinion glassfish is more user friendly than jboss so i decided use glassfish for my project

big,complex,application,smaller,easier
jboss is a big and quite complex application and glassfish is smaller and i find it easier to understand

implementation,smaller,whole
as for me jboss implementation is smaller than the whole glassfish so i m using

weblogic,better,native,spring,context,direct,mq
in weblogic and glassfish you ll be better inspired by deploying the native ibm jca resource adapter and creating jndi resources then referenced in the spring context as above in jboss a direct mq client bean declaration suits best as below

location,popular,idea
but in my location jboss is more popular than glassfish so i have a idea

better,slick,gui-based,admin,console,command,line
glassfish however performs better than jboss and has a very slick gui-based admin console whereas jboss can only be administrated with a command line

better,product,next,project,documentation
even if jboss is the better product in my next project i will shift to glassfish because of the better documentation

v3,production,environment,application,server,features,stability
glassfish v3 vs jboss 7.0 in using in production environment i know more people use jboss the application server but glassfish has more features and stability over jboss
