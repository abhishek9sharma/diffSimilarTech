2, user, consider, ---------------------------------------------------

2-,consider,stemmers,simpler
2- consider stemming instead of lemmatization stemmers are much simpler smaller and usually faster than lemmatizers and for many applications their results are good enough

user,simpler,version
you can also user a stemming which is a simpler version of lemmatization

others---------------------------------------------------

thing,porter,algorithm,better,cause.
p the second thing is porter stemming algorithm but then i realized lemmatization is much better for my cause.

better,results,source
lemmatization should lead to better results than stemming source

valid,operation,better,solution,faster
if you require that the words are still valid after this operation lemmatization will be a better solution otherwise stemming might be better because it is way faster to execute

harder,ready
lemmatization is relatively more complicated as compare to stemming that is why it s harder to find some ready and free solution
