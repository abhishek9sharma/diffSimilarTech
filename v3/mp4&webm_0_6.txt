little,better
the ogv version of the video seems to run a little better than the webm which itself seems to run better than the mp4

faster,standard,familiar,format
probably webm will load faster than standard mp4 but i am not so familiar with webm format

robust,place
webm is usually more robust than mp4 which can be all over the place

free,alternative,support,platforms
- you can also consider using webm which is a free alternative to h.264 and has better support on some platforms than fragmented mp4

faster
also it looks like when i transcode webm to mp4 2.7 is 30 faster than webm

implementation,fallback,browsers
the mp4 implementation is more widely used and wouldn t require a webm fallback in most browsers
