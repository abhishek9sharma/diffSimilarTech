offsets,main,shader,switches
then sort entities by shader mapping and render using offsets in the main vbo thus minimizing shader and vao switches

possible
is it possible to use the same vbo with more than one vao like this

issue,big,vertices,uint,maximum
i have issue with drawing big vbo with vao because the vbo has more than 65536 vertices and my vao is just uint that has maximum 65536
