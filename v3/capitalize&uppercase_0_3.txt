thumb,labels,relationship,types,better,readability
as a rule of thumb it is recommended to write labels as capitalize and relationship types in uppercase thus achieving a better readability

first,letters,lower,letter
based on what i ve thrown at it names with first letters capitalize will become lower case only if it isn t followed by another by another uppercase letter

sparsity,data,words,rarer,corpus,statistics,decent
for some purposes lowercasing everything is better because it lowers the sparsity of the data uppercase words are rarer and might confuse the system unless you have a massive corpus such that the statistics on capitalize words are decent
