72x72, tablet, dpi, ---------------------------------------------------

ldpi,mdpi,over-large,icons,smaller,layout
if you re diligent about making graphics for at least the main three densities ldpi mdpi and hdpi then you should not see over-large icons except where the screens is physically smaller than your layout expects it

image,smaller,greater,dpi
edit - now that i think about it i m not sure why your image would appear smaller unless your screens had a greater dpi than hdpi

device,api,density,lower
i am not aware of any device that can use api 14 with a screens density lower than hdpi

image,folder,xhdpi,images,density,smaller
i have tested that by modifying one image in hdpi folder and keep it as it is in the xhdpi folder the result was note 1 is loading from the xhdpi folder am i missing something here it suppose to load images from the hdpi folder because it s screens density is smaller than 320 dpi

images,folder,density,smaller
it suppose to load images from the hdpi folder because it s screens density is smaller than 320 dpi

density,tablet,bigger,ones,folder,phone
owing to the fact that the screens density on the tablet is smaller android therefore uses the images in the mdpi folder for the tablet and the slightly bigger ones in the hdpi folder for the phone

res,mdpi,bigger,xhdpi
try placing youre images in res mdpi they will be streched to fit screens which are bigger hdpi xhdpi

high,density,smaller,mdpi
ldpi assets will look bad on high density screens but are exponentially smaller than mdpi which is exponentially smaller than hdpi etc

images,folder,density,smaller
am i missing something here it suppose to load images from the hdpi folder because it s screens density is smaller than 320 dpi

density,xhdpi,mdpi,72x72
if the screens density is less than xhdpi i load smaller sampled sizes of the 96x96 image - as 36x36 for ldpi 48x48 for mdpi 72x72 for hdpi

ldpi,mdpi,resolutions,table
even if i create three versions for ldpi mdpi and hdpi there are more than screens resolutions in that table if there is no matching image it will scale my image and may not retain the aspect ratio

others---------------------------------------------------

resolution,480x800,smaller,size,normal,aka,device
now i have another device which has the same pixel resolution of 480x800 but since the screens is smaller it has screens size normal and hdpi aka device 2

image,longer,width,types,drawables,different,type,mdpi,ldpi,horizontal,scroll
in my android app i have a background image which is longer than the screens width for all the three types of screens.this implies that i have got 3 drawables each for different screens type mdpi ldpi hdpi and hence i have included a horizontal scroll bar in my app
