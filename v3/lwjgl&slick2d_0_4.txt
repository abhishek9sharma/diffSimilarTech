newer
slick2d is made to work with lwjgl 2 lwjgl 3 however is way newer than slick2d and therefore slick2d does not support using lwjgl 3

you could use slick2d it is way easier to use and works with lwjgl

on one hand slick2d is fast and simple but it seems lwjgl is more adaptable in the sense that it has both 2d and 3d capabilities

i ve been delving into game programming with slick2d and i ve began to wonder if in the long run knowing lwjgl would be more helpful
