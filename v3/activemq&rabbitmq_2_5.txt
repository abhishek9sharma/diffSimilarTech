what does rabbitmq do better or worse than activemq

better,sense,easy
it seems activemq is better than rabbitmq in the sense that it is easy to set up and maintenance for cluster

others---------------------------------------------------

amqp,attempt,zeromq,complete,red
lot s of free stuff available look for anything implementing amqp for example and not limited to apache s attempt - activemq zeromq as listed above rabbitmq which is more complete than zero and even red hat are in the game with red hat messaging

use,prod,fine,highroad,better
i use activemq in prod and fine with it but for very highroad rabbitmq will be better

apache,popular,qpid,jms,provider
apache activemq which is way more popular than qpid or rabbitmq - or indeed any jms provider would work just fine
