load,servers,simpler,client
as for streaming it s better to use udp first because it lowers the load on servers but mostly because you can send packets with multicast it s simpler than sending it to each connected client

efficient,datagram,guarantee,data,receivers
multicast are more efficient than datagram socket however it also uses udp and hence does not provide any guarantee that the data packets will be received by all receivers

form,discovery,broadcast,better,udp
a third possibility would be to send out some form of discovery packets either by broadcast or better by multicast udp
