better,order,runtime,method,decoration
i think this is better done with a metaclass in order to handle both runtime and subclassing method decoration

easier
you could then wrap this up in a metaclass to make it easier for people who are subclassing

little,magic
it s a little less magic than metaclass but it also means you re going to have to remember to decorate each subclassing
