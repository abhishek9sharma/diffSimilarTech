greater, int, value, ---------------------------------------------------

value,greater,counter
then while the temp value is greater than 99 subtract 100 from it and add 1 to the counter

addition,greater,number,higher,order
if you continue to use your method of performing this task then you need to manually check if the addition of the two lower order decimal digits has caused a carry by checking if the result of the addition is greater than 10 and if it is subtract 10 from the number and then add 1 to the higher order digit calculation

greater,stacksize,number
while the number is greater than stacksize add a stacksize to the stack and subtract that from the number

string,int,value,method,result,greater
provided a string i want to convert the chars from the string to an int add a value from another method getkey to this number and if the result is greater than 26 subtract 26

value,greater,counter
then while the temp value is greater than 9 subtract 10 from it and add 1 to the counter

x,greater
look at it this way based on your logic while x is greater than 100 add 5 while it s greater than 500 subtract 5 .

difference,negative,2pi,greater
just take the difference and if it s negative add 2pi and then if it s greater than 2pi subtract 2pi

oodles, remainder, ---------------------------------------------------

remainder
if the remainder is less than 3 subtract the remainder else add 5 - remainder

remainder,oodles
division is much harder to calculate with subtractions can t go too far find remainder - if a float then calculate fraction from remainder which in itself is oodles of add multiplying and subtract

others---------------------------------------------------

left,smaller,result,larger
quick idea - go through the roman number from right to left if value of more to the left is smaller than then subtract it from the result if larger then add it

root,set,sum,cubes
to find all the pairs of integers x and y that sum to n when cubed set x to the largest integer less than the cube root of n set y to 0 then repeatedly add 1 to y if the sum of the cubes is less than n subtract 1 from x if the sum of the cubes is greater than n and output the pair otherwise stopping when x and y cross

help,number,result,numbers,sum
i need some help though i need each number in that list to be subtract from 27 then if the result is less than 33 add 94 then print the numbers as they were just with that sum completed how do i do this

nodes,score,closer
we observe that for 7 nodes 1 2 3 5 6 8 9 we are getting further by 1 add 7 9-2 to the score for other 2 4 7 we are getting closer by 1 subtract 2

price
if the price is less than 25 add 10 to that price if the price is 25 or over i want to subtract 10 from that price

values,lower,computer,ascii,higher
to make the value gotten from the above steps to a hexadecimal digit in character form then for values lower than 10 add 0 if you re on a computer with with ascii encoding and for values at 10 or higher then subtract ten and add a

complex,sub,sense,group
i know this is a simple example but for more complex code if sub add and sub subtract had more code would it make sense to group in subroutines

faster,subtraction
since addition can be faster then subtraction we add the offset instead of subtract it from 31

h,time
if there is more than that subtract 250 + 180 and add 6 h to the time needed
