example, tablecelleditor, rendering, ---------------------------------------------------

better,rendering,strategy
i don t really think that jtable will help you here anyhow better than jlist - it has the same rendering strategy

better,jcomponents,tablecelleditor,example
i think jtable would be better jcomponents as jlist because there you can implements tablecelleditor maybe example with similair output here

display, better, ---------------------------------------------------

better
a jlist would probably be better than a jtable

better,display
probably using a jlist or a jtable is a better choice than display records using text fields

others---------------------------------------------------

custom,class,sorts,bigger,panel
should i go further and make a custom jtable class of sorts and jlist can have a bigger panel size but they are only painted and not intractable

column,commandeditors,easier,cell,editor
it seems like you only need one column of commandeditors so jlist would ve been easier to use had it support cell editor like jtable does
