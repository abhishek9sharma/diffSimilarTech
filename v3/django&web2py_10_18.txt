better, easier, ---------------------------------------------------

easier
i think you ll find that web2py is even easier to learn and use than rails and django

better
anything django does web2py does better

appadmin, big, box, ---------------------------------------------------

gae,better,box
as i understand it web2py supports gae better out of the box than django

better,appadmin,administrators
django s is better web2py s appadmin is for administrators only

wonderful,framework,better,limited
django is also a wonderful framework but web2py is just better in my limited experience opinion

admin,better,customizable,appadmin
django s admin is better and more customizable than web2py s appadmin

big,purpose,webpy,better
we thought of django but we think that is very big for our purpose and we decided that webpy or web2py is a better option

turbo,gears,better
django turbo gears web2py which is better for what

mvc, hindsight, conveniences, ---------------------------------------------------

mvc,framework,things,easier
plus moving from a php mvc framework to web2py or even django would make things easier

conveniences,environment,newer,hindsight,easier
i prefer web2py because there are more conveniences built into the environment than offered by django but web2py is much newer than django and hindsight always makes it easier make new implementations better

others---------------------------------------------------

faster,ror,shadow
you will get web2py working faster than either django or ror without a shadow of a doubt

popular,familiar,heavy,complex
to answer klochner both seems quite popular but ruby is not a language that i am familiar with and django seems more heavy and complex to me than web2py

days
i have just spent a few days playing around with web2py and really like it and i am wondering if django offers something more that i am missing out on

important,issue,easier,pylons
anyway the most important issue is that web2py is easier than django pylons php and rails

lower,initial,learning,curve,tool
having said that web2py has a lower initial learning curve than django as it was specifically designed as a learning tool

lightweight,counts
and web2py is more lightweight than django rails whatever on pretty much all counts

focus,simple,better,complex,explicit
web2py has more focus on simple is better than complex but django has more focus on explicit is better than implicit

young,mailing,month,similar,turbogears
web2py may be young but the mailing list has 2000 messages month which is similar to django and far more than turbogears
