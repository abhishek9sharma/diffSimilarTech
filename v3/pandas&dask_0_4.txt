hdf5,familiar
this may help those confused by dask and hdf5 but more familiar with pandas like myself

slower,smaller,datasets
1 i guess dask will be slower than pandas for smaller datasets

flexible,data,parts,dataframes,memory
pandas is far more flexible for working with data so i often bring parts of dask dataframes into memory manipulate columns and create new ones

storage,.csv,dataframes,faster,hdf5,slower,csv
when hdf5 storage can be accessed fast than .csv and when dask creates dataframes faster than pandas why is dask from hdf5 slower than dask from csv
