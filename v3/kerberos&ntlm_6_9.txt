ways, performance, better, ---------------------------------------------------

ways,better
in fact in some ways ntlm is better than kerberos

better
kerberos could be considered as a better option than ntlm

better,performance
i understand that kerberos has better performance than ntlm

secure, credentials, domain, ---------------------------------------------------

secure
but since ntlm is less secure than kerberos why isn t it the other way around

secure,domain,credentials
but as i understand it ntlm disallows the more secure kerberos domain credentials if they re available

others---------------------------------------------------

bit,straight,good,sso,capabilities
it seems a little bit more straight forward than kerberos but provides good ntlm sso capabilities

secure
if you really want to go more secure than ntlm your may want to configure kerberos

huge,tokens,network,slower
for a low traffic site the huge tokens that kerberos send across the network actually makes it slower than ntlm

complex,faster,certain,limit
kerberos is complex to set up and even though it generally is considered faster than ntlm this is only true when you reach a certain limit of simultanious users on your site
