server,side,nothing,socket,factory
on the server side you re using tcplistener which is nothing more than a socket or tcpclient factory

socket,class,easy
what i suggest that you use sockets for you needs you can use the framework socket class but tcplistener class and tcpclient class are much more easy to use
