alternative, avi, platforms, ---------------------------------------------------

free,alternative,better,support,platforms
- you can also consider using webm which is a free alternative to h.264 and has better support on some platforms than fragmented mp4

support,avi,format,better
it doesn t support avi at the moment but imho mp4 format is better suited for h.264 anyway

others---------------------------------------------------

provided,sps,beginning,raw,stream,richer
when i demux an mp4 with ffmpeg the provided sps at the beginning of the raw h.264 stream is richer than mine

container,vp8
h.264 is more often encapsulated in mp4 container and vp8 in mkv

size,codec,bigger
but i don t know why the size of mp4 video with h.264 codec is bigger than the size of the image set in the only implementation i found so i made my own archive format that is basically the imageset merged together in 1 file and compressed with snappy plus the info for split them again

formats,vs,exact,data,mp3,aac,audio,devices
both formats flv vs mp4 can contain exact same data h.264 video with mp3 or aac audio but mp4 is supported in more devices software
