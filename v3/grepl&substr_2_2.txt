benchmark,test,operation,better,sapply,vectorised
finally i also made a benchmark test which shows that substr operation is slightly better than sapply grepl and significantly better than vectorised grepl alone

david,arenburg,answer,sapply,sixiang.hu,better
therefore vectorized substr by david arenburg is the best answer while sapply grepl by sixiang.hu and significantly better than grepl by david arenburg
