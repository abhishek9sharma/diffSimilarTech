slower, faster, execution, ---------------------------------------------------

operation-for-operation,slower,reality,application
while ruby and python are both interpreted-language and operation-for-operation slower than compiled-language the reality is in executing an application only a small portion of cpu time is spent in your code and the majority is spent into the built-in libraries you call into which are often native implementations and thus are as fast as compiled code

little,slower
php is an interpreted-language so will run a little slower than a compiled-language

slower
and perl like any interpreted-language is much slower than a compiled-language

slower,overhead
this makes interpreted-language generally slower than compiled-language due to the overhead of running the vm or interpreter

faster,ball
a compiled-language will generally run faster than an interpreted-language so i think ruby and php start behind the eight ball but it really comes down to how you use the language and how you structure the code

faster,execution,compilation,step
so compiled-language are faster in execution as at the time of execution no compilation is required but in interpreted-language each execution step is preceded by a compilation step every time making it slow

faster
that being said a compiled-language like c will almost always be faster than an interpreted-language like javascript

faster,account,development
of course c++ or any compiled-language will be faster than an interpreted-language but you also have to take in account the development time of the web site app

slower,difference,negligible
mostly interpreted-language are a bit slower compared with compiled-language but i guess the difference is almost negligible in coffeescript javascript because of node.js

slower,cpu,line
naturally interpreted-language will run slower than compiled-language as compiled code can be ran blindly by the cpu where as compiled code needs to be checked ran line by line

different,opinion,slower
this is a good question but should be formulated a little different in my opinion for example why are interpreted-language slower than compiled-language

orders,magnitude,slower
an interpreted-language will typically run one to two orders of magnitude slower than a compiled-language

execution,speed,slower,need
interpreted-language execution speed are slower than compiled-language true but once there is need for more speed you can call in compiled stuff through gems or micro services

faster
from what i know a compiled-language such as c++ is much faster than an interpreted-language such as javascript

time,slower
it should be noted that interpreted-language are inherently many time slower than natively compiled-language

programs,faster,uncompiled
in my general programming experience compiled c c++ programs generally run faster than most other compiled-language like java or even compiled python and almost always run faster than interpreted-language like uncompiled python or javascript

compromise,portability,slower
java seeks to find a compromise between a purely compiled-language with no portability and a purely interpreted-language that is significantly slower

slower
fact is that interpreted-language like php are always slower than a compiled-language

faster,jit,trivial
there is no way an interpreted-language can be faster than a compiled-language or even a jit language under trivial conditions

slower
interpreted-language tend to be but not always are significantly slower than compiled-language

definition,slower,drawback,execution
python is an interpreted-language so by definition is slower than other compiled-language but the drawback in the execution speed is not even noticeable in most of applications

easier, possible, bytecode, ---------------------------------------------------

easier,possible
an interpreted-language surely makes it easier but this is still entirely possible with compiled-language like c

easier,bytecode
while java could be described as a compiled and interpreted-language it s probably easier to think of java itself as a compiled-language and java bytecode as an interpreted-language

performant, operations, level, ---------------------------------------------------

level,performant,assembly
then c which is one those languages closer to the processor level is very performant and generally speaking compiled-language because they turn your code into assembly language are more performant than interpreted-language

performant,operations
interpreted-language are inherently less performant than compiled-language - c will generally outperform python - some operations more than others

better, performance, examples, ---------------------------------------------------

performance,programs,better
performance of programs in compiled-language is significantly better than that of an interpreted-language

examples,better,performance
writing in a compiled-language java or c++ in your examples would almost certainly give better performance than an interpreted-language like php

others---------------------------------------------------

dynamic,common
this is usually seen in dynamic interpreted-language but is less common in compiled-language

high-level,features,life,easier
interpreted-language are usually more high-level and therefore have features as dynamic typing including creating new variables dynamically without declaration the infamous eval and many many other features that make a programmer s life easier - but why can t compiled-language have these as well

efficiency,benefit,statements,smaller
my guess is that in interpreted-language the efficiency benefit in using switch statements is indeed smaller than in compiled-language

overhead
especially in an interpreted-language like php where classes add more overhead than a compiled-language

better
are compiled-language better than interpreted-language or vice-versa
