browser, faster, slower, ---------------------------------------------------

slower,faster
it seems to be slower in google-chrome and firefox but is significantly faster in opera

better
much better than opera firefox and google-chrome

diff1,faster
conclusion diff1 is faster in firefox opera and safari diff2 is faster in ie and google-chrome

browser,faster,webkit
the results varied from a browser to another firefox 4.0b12 is faster using but google-chrome webkit and opera is faster when using

browser,quicker
using any other browser google-chrome firefox and opera it s much quicker

idea,frame,browser,correct
the idea is that if they are using ie then they must install google-chrome frame and if they are using less than firefox 4 or opera 11.5 then they must upgrade their browser not not sure if the way i am doing that is correct

browsers, major, mode, ---------------------------------------------------

major,browsers,details
this code to date is only supported by a couple of the major browsers namely google-chrome 37 and opera 24 see more details here

browsers,helpful,mode,powerful
since you noted thoughts on other browsers would be helpful opera s kiosk mode seems more powerful than google-chrome s

browsers,nice
on all of the other browsers i ve tried safari opera ie google-chrome it looks much less nice because all of those browsers scroll half a screen at a time

fireofx,better,css
fireofx google-chrome safari and opera has better css selectors support compare to ie

major,browsers,better,container
it s way faster on ie but other major browsers firefox google-chrome safari and opera perform better when using a container and then appending it fragment or div

higher, text, linux, ---------------------------------------------------

linux,text,pixel,higher
on linux google-chrome displays text about one pixel higher than firefox and opera

pixels,higher,lower
in safari it is several pixels higher up than in firefox and google-chrome and significantly lower in opera

bigger, ie7, div, ---------------------------------------------------

share,bigger,ie7
according to some - browser - statistics ie6 market share is still bigger than google-chrome safari and opera together nearly as much as ie7

div,width,bigger
on your screenshot div width in opera is bigger than in firefox and google-chrome

others---------------------------------------------------

work,setting,iframed,page,larger,part,text
safari and opera work with the google-chrome setting but firefox and ie display the iframed page larger than google-chrome causing part of the text to be cut off

fine,assitional,css,settings,ribbon,div,higher
now this works fine in google-chrome and safari and i have had to use assitional css settings for firefox but ie and opera both display my ribbon div about 25px higher than in google-chrome or safari

recent,builds,bigger,viewport,presto,table
google-chrome recent builds only and firefox are behaving very strict in this regard no matter how much content you have it will be no bigger than your viewport while opera presto behaves more like a table 100 is treated as a minimum not a maximum

browsers,behavior,insert,first,line,div,better,last
the second happened when you remove everything and starting type and hit enter different browsers behavior very differently google-chrome insert very first line as a just text node of contenteditable container and than put every new line into div opera 12.12 handle it better and it never allows remove last div node ie9-10 starting jump around and after you started again uses p tags instead of div that s not even such a disaster just inconsistency but yet the firefox is not yet even trying to change it s br behavior

usage,outdated,release,popular,previous,versions,penultimate,version
for comparison 0.68 usage means this outdated google-chrome release is more popular than the current and previous versions of opera the penultimate version of safari on ios and ie 9 or 10

works,weirdish,blur,effect,hover,smaller,ends
works in google-chrome firefox a bit weirdish blur effect on hover opera ends look smaller safari ends look smaller

latest,version,longer,userscripts,box
also nice to know is the fact that the latest version of google-chrome and also opera don t know since when but longer than google-chrome supports userscripts out of the box no need to install any add-ons

ie6,version
according to w3counter ie6 is used by more people than opera safari and any version of google-chrome

specific,browser,webkit,devs,knowledgeable
usually you want to avoid solutions from browser-vendor as they ll cater toward that specific browser but opera webkit google-chrome safari firefox devs are usually more knowledgeable in terms of cross-browser solutions and compliance with the standards than m ones

answers,browser,support,message,default,internet,explorer
answers in opera was checking browser support for my page and wanted to search some stuff up. i don t get this message in my default browser google-chrome nor in internet explorer or firefox

note,faster,memory,leaks
note i recommend using opera - it is much faster than google-chrome as it doesn t have memory leaks and comes with a built-in ad blocker

older,safe,insertadjacenthtml
well unless you re targeting older than google-chrome 1.0 firefox 8.0 ie 4.0 opera 7.0 or safari 4.0 it s safe to use insertadjacenthtml

complete,finger,touch
opera probably is more complete to manage canvas than google-chrome but the problem is always to exclude the finger touch if i m using the pen

image,longer
as you can see in the image google-chrome is running a lot longer than opera

extensions,possible,widgets
firefox just provides far more access to its own internals and system to the extensions so its technically possible to do more with them than with opera widgets or google-chrome extensions

standards,compliant,good,picky
i have already run into problems with old javascript code which i thought was standards compliant by firefox or opera standards - which are pretty good but google-chrome was even more picky

14-times,time
google-chrome took more than 14-times more time to complete than opera

green,painting
especially in opera there is much more green in the painting than in google-chrome

coverage,market,half,huge
in any case vorbis clearly has the most coverage google-chrome has more of the market than safari now opera is about half of safari and obviously firefox is huge and it doesn t really have the strong opposition that theora has
