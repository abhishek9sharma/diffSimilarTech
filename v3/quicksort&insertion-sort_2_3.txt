time-efficient, faster, linkedlist, ---------------------------------------------------

faster,linkedlist
i think that insertion-sort would be much faster then quicksort when sorting a linkedlist

time-efficient,linkedlist
it seems that when sorting insertion-sort would be more time-efficient then quicksort when sorting a linkedlist

cs,better,merge-sort
in cs insertion-sort is less commonly used because we have much better algorithms quicksort and merge-sort come to mind
