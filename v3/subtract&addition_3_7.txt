level, instructions, division, ---------------------------------------------------

slower,faster,basic,instructions,comparison
on most processors a boolean operation has no reason to significantly be slower or faster than an addition both are basic instructions even though comparison may take two of them subtract then comparing to zero

subtraction,level,logic,division,slower
division is performed by repeated subtraction therefore needs more level of subtract logic making division slower than addition

faster,subtraction
since addition can be faster then subtraction we add the offset instead of subtract it from 31

others---------------------------------------------------

result,expression,division,interesting,multiplication,fma,single
however if the result a is added to or subtract from another expression and not reused then starting with the division may be more interesting since you can group the multiplication with the following addition by using a fma thus with a single rounding

method,task,lower,order,digits,result,greater,number,higher
if you continue to use your method of performing this task then you need to manually check if the addition of the two lower order decimal digits has caused a carry by checking if the result of the addition is greater than 10 and if it is subtract 10 from the number and then add 1 to the higher order digit calculation

alu,command,numbers,bit,number,simple,complement
when the alu gets a command to subtract it is given 2 numbers - it makes a not to every bit of the second number and makes a simple addition and adds 1 more because 2 s complement is not to every bit +1

strict,rare,subtraction,common,image
strict addition is rare but subtraction is more common like when you subtract one image from its filtered one
