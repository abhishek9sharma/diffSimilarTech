likely, advanced, wtp, ---------------------------------------------------

plugin,eclipse,compatibility,plugins,likely
moreover i m using m2e the maven plugin for eclipse so it seems that the compatibility of any maven plugins that might work by themselves is even less likely with m2e

wtp,plugin,eclipse,advanced
as far as i remember the support of wtp was removed from the plugin since the maven eclipse m2e plugin got more advanced

others---------------------------------------------------

go-have-a-coffee-break-while-you-wait-for-it,slow,performance,project,larger
the problem i found with the m2e though was that it always got so horribly ridiculously go-have-a-coffee-break-while-you-wait-for-it slow performance when the maven project became larger adding more and more sub-projects

simpler,logic,things
the eclipse builder uses simpler logic than maven so sometimes the things m2e does are just not enough

longer,works,builder,things
with 0.13 m2e this no longer works as the maven builder appears to put things in target your-artificat-version-snapshot web-inf classes

steeper,learning,projects,integration,iam
maven 2 has a steeper learning curve but provides a much richer set of functionality for building your projects and eclipse integration through m2e or iam

dependencies,better
that way of adding dependencies is better managed by maven with m2e

words,friendly
in other words m2e is more friendly to the maven way

platform,better,integration,additional,plugins,web
m2e is also a platform that let others provide better integration with additional maven plugins android web development etc.
