versioning, different, msi, ---------------------------------------------------

product,different,versioning,larger
upgrade code must be the same product code must be different and installation versioning must be larger in either first second or third number

msi,product,new,higher
when you install a msi with abovementioned settings msi will check if any other product installed with same upgrade code if it finds a product then it will check if the new installation has a higher versioning

others---------------------------------------------------

ubuntu,kernel,docker,difficult
on ubuntu 12 04 the kernel must be upgrade and docker installation is more difficult

eclipse,slower
does an eclipse installation perform slower after the upgrade

directory,ci,central,place,disk,space
you should be able to share the system directory across all of your ci installation providing a central place for upgrade and using less disk space

manifest,clickonce,older,brand,new,user-specific
downsides are that you have to digitally sign the application assemblies and clickonce manifest so clickonce can verify the upgrade and replace the older versioning instead of creating a brand new installation clickonce only installs into a user-specific app directory not into the all users program files directory and you cannot have any user-customizable install settings like installing various components or sidechaining additional package installs besides prerequisites

time,references,guids
you probably have authored upgrade of your install incorrectly in some way so every time you tested your installation you were adding more references to the guids tied to these registry keys

transaction,msi-style,better,startup,database-application
as for production side of things upgrading your database in transaction msi-style installation is much better than attempting to upgrade at each app startup since you can potentially end up with desynchronized database-application versioning

ase,database,documentation,databases
as the versioning of the ase in the dumped database will likely be older than the versioning of ase you are installing to do the restore you will technically be doing a database upgrade so you will want to review the installation documentation regarding upgrading databases

user,patch,smaller,package,entire
this can enable the user to download an upgrade patch that is much smaller than the installation package for the entire product
