slower, small, ti, ---------------------------------------------------

ti,faster,depth,slow
using orientdb that is supposed ti be faster than neo4j for depth i m seeing a slow performance

slow,slower,small,150k
i found that orientdb is too slow at least much slower than neo4j even on relatively small 150k datasets when searching records by text pattern despite the presence of indices

others---------------------------------------------------

number,requests,lower
the number of requests orientdb could serve is consistently 3 to 5 times lower than neo4j

blog,good,better,complex,types
i read in some blog that orientdb performs at least as good if not better than neo4j while also offering more complex types like mongodb would

fancy,advanced,popular,heroku
orientdb looks more fancy and advanced but not as popular as neo4j and is not supported on heroku

short,full,replication,better,documentation
in very short orientdb supports full replication while it seems neo4j does not natively but neo4j would be more widely adopted and has better documentation

result,longer
as you can see the neo4j result is way longer then the one from orientdb
