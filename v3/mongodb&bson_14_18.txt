format, storage, types, ---------------------------------------------------

int64,int32,storage,size
the distinction between int64 and int32 in mongodb is more about bson storage size

queries,json,format,angular.js,faster
i generally use mongodb because it returns queries in json format integrates well with angular.js and its bson format is much faster than json

server-side,document,binary,format,richer,types
mongodb s server-side document representation is a json-like binary format called bson which has richer types than javascript json and preserves field order

storage,format,native,types
the bson storage format used by mongodb supports more native types than javascript including 32-bit and 64-bit integers

mb, larger, limit, ---------------------------------------------------

json,representation,document,limit,compact
note that json representation of mongodb document could exceed this limit since bson is more compact

files,larger,document,size,limit,mb
gridfs is not a server-side feature but rather a convention on how files larger than the bson document size limit of 16 mb can be stored in mongodb

document,larger,mb,exception
so if your document bson is larger than 16 mb mongodb throws exception

document,json,structure,specific
a document in mongodb is more or less like a json structure bson to be specific

data,json,precise
yes mongodb persists data as json or bson to be more precise but you don t have do deal with it

smaller,maximum,document,size
mongodb must be smaller than the maximum bson document size

levels, nesting, documents, ---------------------------------------------------

levels,nesting,documents
mongodb supports no more than 100 levels of nesting for bson documents

levels,nesting,documents
basically mongodb supports no more than 100 levels of nesting for bson documents

levels,nesting
mongodb supports no more than 100 levels of nesting for bson

levels,document.
mongodb supports no more than 100 levels of nesting for bson document.

others---------------------------------------------------

12-byte,string,shorter,form
how to encode 12-byte bson string of mongodb s objectid to shorter form

stores,memory,based,system,flexible,objects
mongodb stores everything in memory anyway and works in a similar vein being a key-value based system however i believe mongodb is more flexible as it allows for storing bson objects within themselves

value,json,better,fit,default,stores,data,additional
if your requirement is to store a key with value as json then mongodb is a better fit in this scenario as by default mongodb stores data in bson which is json + additional data types

annoying,data,back,office,pain,binary,different,platforms,representation
the bson becomes even more annoying to work with when exporting data from mongo to another db platform this is the case when dealing with big data that is collected and you want to merge it with some properties from the back office mongodb this means a lot of pain you need to transform the binary objectid to a string in order to join with the id in different platforms that do not use bson representation
