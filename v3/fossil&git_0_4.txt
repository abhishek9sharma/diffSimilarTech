article,database
from the article it sounds like fossil isn t a database any more than git is a database

merge,options,workflow,likely
4 fewer merge options than in git though the fossil workflow makes merging less likely to occur in the first place.

system,rcs,mercurial,subversion
as the comments already mention if you are starting out with version control you would be well advised to choose a newer system than rcs git mercurial fossil subversion ...

easy,easier,sqlite,file
fossil is another one that s easy to use i would say easier than git to learn but it uses an sqlite file to store your code and i m not sure if it scales to really big projects
