secure, observations, obsolete, ---------------------------------------------------

least,secure,better
des is the least secure 3des is better but i d go for the aes

better,speedup,observations
if you used aes then you might see a better speedup over the des 3des observations

encrypted,text,better,safer
how ever if you insist to use some api in java i have to say that des is really old way to encrypted text 3des desede or aes will be better and safer both of them have already been supported since java6

obsolete,algorithm,better
you re using des in your example which is a flawed and obsolete algorithm alternatively use 3des so i suggest moving to aes which provides better encryption

older, aes-ni, cpu, ---------------------------------------------------

faster,cpu,aes-ni
aes can be even much faster than des or 3des when the cpu supports aes-ni

faster,default,older
if aes is negotiated it s faster than des and 3des used by default by older applications

others---------------------------------------------------

analysis,rijndael-128,fast,bigger,size
according to this analysis aes rijndael-128 is more than twice as fast as des 3des with a bigger key size more secure

better,sense,secure,performance,necessity,worse
edit 3des is better than des in the sense that it s significantly more secure but still less secure than aes but its performance is of necessity significantly worse than aes des or twofish because you re essentially applying des three times

expensive
3des is more expensive than aes for example

slower
furthermore 3des is much slower than aes
