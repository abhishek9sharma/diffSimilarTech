uwp,possible,decimal,places,different,engine
if this code challenge is for a uwp app then it is possible that the built in geocode may return more decimal places as it currently uses a different geocoding engine at the moment

similar,ggmap,batch,locations,error,geocodequerycheck,queries,errors
i had a similar problem using ggmap geocode for a batch of locations where roughly 20 of locations gave the over query limit error even though geocodequerycheck would show more than enough geocoding queries remaining and the errors were sporadically spread throughout the locations not just the last 20

location,reverse,reliable,requests,server,call
2 location + reverse geocoding - seems more reliable but requests location services on the device does it work on wifi only tablets and for it to be enabled and requires time to a fetch location b server call to reverse geocode

gem,support,step
can the geocode gem support more than one geocoding step

api,better,usage,limits
the geocoding api works better than geocode normally but has usage limits and the implementation is bigger
