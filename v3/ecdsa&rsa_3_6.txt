greater, size, strength, ---------------------------------------------------

part,dsa,shorter,signatures,equivalent,1024-bit,signature
for the signature part you may want to use dsa or ecdsa they yield much shorter signatures typically 320 bits for a dsa signature of security equivalent to a 1024-bit rsa signature

dsa,shorter,signatures,greater,strength
dsa and ecdsa both produce shorter signatures with much greater strength that rsa

size,cookies,signatures,smaller,equivalent
if you re interesting in reducing the size of the resulting cookies you should consider using ecdsa rather than rsa to produce the signatures - ecdsa signatures are considerably smaller than rsa signatures of an equivalent security factor

others---------------------------------------------------

faster,private,operations,high,efficiency,enough
ecdsa is much faster than rsa for private key operations so it should definitely be preferred over rsa when high efficiency is required unless rsa is still fast enough something that may very well be the case

point,view,better,performance,core,openssl,signatures,second,nist,curve
from the central authority point of view ecdsa also allows better performance on my pc using a single core openssl crunches out more than 6500 ecdsa signatures per second in the p-192 nist curve and only 1145 rsa signatures per second with a 1024-bit key

faster,verification
rsa is much faster then ecdsa at verification
