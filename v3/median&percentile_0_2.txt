25th,75th,simpler,first
in the end i will add a band that displays 25th - 75th percentile but i figured working with the median would be simpler first

someone,top,productive,useful,programmers
as one good programmer can be more productive than two average programmers i vaguely remember an old ibm study concluding someone in the top percentile was 27x more productive than median it s useful to see the same programmers doing it both ways
