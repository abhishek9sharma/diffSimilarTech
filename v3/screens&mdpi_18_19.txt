good, 72x72, resolution, ---------------------------------------------------

density,xhdpi,ldpi,48x48,72x72,hdpi
if the screens density is less than xhdpi i load smaller sampled sizes of the 96x96 image - as 36x36 for ldpi 48x48 for mdpi 72x72 for hdpi

densities,ldpi,hdpi,over-large,icons,smaller,layout
if you re diligent about making graphics for at least the main three densities ldpi mdpi and hdpi then you should not see over-large icons except where the screens is physically smaller than your layout expects it

issue,phone,smaller,layout,res
addressing issue #2 if your mdpi phone has a smaller screens than 600dp it will use the layout in res layout folder

today,ldpi,smaller,good,large,lower,density
i don t know how many screens today are still ldpi and mdpi but i want to support smaller screens while still looking good on large screens even large screens that are lower density

image,hdpi,smaller,ldpi
a ldpi image on a hdpi screens would appear smaller than the same image on a mdpi or ldpi screens

images,res,bigger,hdpi
try placing youre images in res mdpi they will be streched to fit screens which are bigger hdpi xhdpi

high,density,smaller,hdpi
ldpi assets will look bad on high density screens but are exponentially smaller than mdpi which is exponentially smaller than hdpi etc

image,ldpi,larger,hdpi
a hdpi image on a ldpi screens would appear larger than the same image on a mdpi or hdpi screens

drawable,ldpi,xhdpi,image,shorter,width
i have used this link to generate nine-patch images however even if i add the files to the drawable ldpi mdpi ldpi xhdpi and xxhdpi folders the image is still shorter than the screens width

resolution,hdpi
so as i said - mdpi also doesn t means that your screens resolution is less than hdpi screens resolution

120x120px,image,smaller,xxhdpi,device,pixels
do note that a 120x120px image if displayed on the screens will be 3x smaller on a xxhdpi device compared to a mdpi device as there are three times as many pixels per inch

versions,ldpi,hdpi,resolutions,table
even if i create three versions for ldpi mdpi and hdpi there are more than screens resolutions in that table if there is no matching image it will scale my image and may not retain the aspect ratio

others---------------------------------------------------

g1,bitmaps,smaller,device,160dpi,small,difference
so a g1 will show mdpi bitmaps slightly smaller than a mdpi device with a true 160dpi screens but this is a very small difference so it s not a big deal

image,longer,width,types,drawables,different,type,ldpi,hdpi
in my android app i have a background image which is longer than the screens width for all the three types of screens.this implies that i have got 3 drawables each for different screens type mdpi ldpi hdpi and hence i have included a horizontal scroll bar in my app

scales,images,resolution,bigger
i read in some tutorials that android automatically scales up the images when the screens resolution is bigger than mdpi

real,phones,bigger,resolution
in other words the if these were real phones the mdpi would have a bigger screens allthough both have the same resolution

density,tablet,android,images,folder
owing to the fact that the screens density on the tablet is smaller android therefore uses the images in the mdpi folder for the tablet and the slightly bigger ones in the hdpi folder for the phone

device,destiny,default,values
if device screens destiny is more than mdpi - use default values folder

high,resolutions,tablet,larger,dpi,rating
the reason those two really high resolutions exist in mdpi is because they are only used on tablet which have a larger screens size...so the dpi rating works out to still be in the midrange
