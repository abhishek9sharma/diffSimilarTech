x, x.getrow, size, ---------------------------------------------------

worse,x,x.getrow
however that is much worse by a factors of 10000 than what i am currently doing which is for matrix x for putting and x.getrow idx .todense for taking

worse,size
however it still performs worse by initially a factors of 3 but as the matrix size increases asymptotically worse by a factors of exactly 2

others---------------------------------------------------

model,nonlinear,bs,smaller
consider a model with lots of factors or nonlinear terms like bs ns or poly the model frame is much smaller compared with model matrix

acp,sub,extract,composition,cluster
after that you can use acp on sub matrix to extract factors and understand more the composition of each cluster

triangle,input,lower,triangular
finally note that by default ichol references the lower triangle of the input matrix and returns a lower triangular factors

character,names,data,frames,confusing,behaviour
perhaps in the same vein and i had a problem of this sort with some of my other data trying to convert character names in matrix and data frames into factors results in more confusing behaviour

better,correlation
which matrix will be better in defining the correlation between the factors

factorization,decomposition,general,ways,approximate,simpler,loss,info
matrix factorization sometimes referred to as matrix decomposition is a general term in ml there are many ways to approximate a matrix using simpler factors sometimes with loss of info

vector,rows,object,slower,normal,distance
i measured the time it takes to calculate the distance between a vector and the rows of a matrix when they are in the object and it work slower by a factors of 3 then the normal distance function

multiplication,ten,old
in the code below i use block multiplication to speed up your code for a 1024x1204 matrix by more than a factors of ten 7.1 s with old code and 0.6s with new using only a single thread without using sse avx

advance,number,complicated,mistaken,two-dimensional
eta to answer your question in more general terms let s say we had the number of subjects and levels set up in advance increasing the number of factors is more complicated unless i m mistaken because then it would no longer be a two-dimensional matrix
