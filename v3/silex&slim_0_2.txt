uglier,afraid,current,version
i think silex produces a bit uglier code than slim but i m afraid to choose slim because it s changing constantly and i will be stuck with the current version if it breaks backward compatibility

bigger,community,point,view
silex seems to have a bigger community than slim maybe it s just my point of view
