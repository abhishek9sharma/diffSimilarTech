faster, threads, project, ---------------------------------------------------

slower
this could mean that put is now slower than get and we have to wait

rate,slower
at times the get rate is slower than the put rate and we see messages backing up

faster,project
you ll get it done much faster by just looking at the sample project i put together

hand,threads,faster
on the one hand we can say let s put 20 threads and get it done faster

view, smaller, strings.xml, ---------------------------------------------------

string,strings.xml,scroll,view,smaller,screens
put the string in strings.xml set it to a text view inside a scroll view so that it doesn t get hidden on smaller screens set autolink to make the links clickable

layout,image,upper,independent,view,smaller,bigger
i need to form a layout in which i want to put an image in the upper 50 of the screen two edittext two button in the lower 50 of the screen and also it should be device independent so that the view doesn t get disturbed on smaller or bigger screens it works fine on minimum 3.2 hvga device but everything goes overlapped if run on a even smaller device

greater, vc, argument, ---------------------------------------------------

exception,byte.parse,string,greater
the reason why you get the exception mentioned is because when you call byte.parse but the string that you put in is greater than 255

compiler,warning,vc++,argument,greater
but i get compiler warning c4309 truncation of constant value in vc++ 2010 whenever the argument to put is greater than 0x7f

width, height, perspective, ---------------------------------------------------

perspective,current,height,image,number,width
to put this in perspective the current project i am working on involves comparing the width and height of an image to get a number to determine if the width is longer than the height or the same

height,element,width,auto,mind,client
and i m just having trouble saying if the image original file s width is greater than the height then we need the height to expand to the height of the surrounding element and put the width at auto so it doesn t get squished but keeping in mind that the client can upload any image size they want with no restrictions of must be 350x350

data, post, methods, ---------------------------------------------------

post,get.if,data,form,secure
data should be in post or get.if you dont put your data in your form then you will have to use get which is less secure than post

multipart,data,method,query,post,appropiate
restful services does not implement an exact way to transfer the info you can use path query string form string or even multipart data so you can do it as you want but in your case instead of using get method with all the data in the query a post or put is more appropiate and you will not hit the query string limit

crud,endpoints,post,methods,base
i was digging through the flask pluggable views documentation and while i find the methodview to be very helpful for making restful crud endpoints usually i end up wanting more than just get post put delete methods under a base route with common decorators and so forth

rid,post,data,bigger
how can i get rid of the post put data getting exponentially bigger

mechanisms,database,slower,data,http
since most data-storage mechanisms in-ram in a database etc. get a lot slower as you put more data in them you should ensure you re only timing your http access and not looking at overall crawler throughput including storage

number, different, series, ---------------------------------------------------

count,number,sequence,different,series
from the count you will get the number of sequence and those which have more than 2 put those in a different series and then add that series in the dataframe

uncertain,statement,number,highter
if you are uncertain you can always put an if statement and check if the number you get back is highter then int.maxvalue

post, url, better, ---------------------------------------------------

post,user,thing,filter,method,safer,difference
both get post user can put any thing in it and you must filter any input that user make it in your form example the value in textfiled sent to server by post method and that don t make it safer than get method the difference between them that the textfiled value doesn t visible in url

url,parameter,post
you can change the http verb near the url parameter to get post put delete or more

post,better,name-value,pair,parameters,url
q1.i know that post is better than put for name-value pair parameters as the get exposes it in url and post doesn t

actions,post
you have mentioned that we can t use actions more than get post put delete which is not true

semantic,controller,request,rest-api,nested,objects,better
so since it is only semantic you can do whatever you want in the controller once you get the request and i suppose your rest-api does not include complex updates of say a part of a list or specific fields in nested objects - i believe put would be the better choice

post,delete...
you could manage more than get or post like put delete...

loop, small, q.empty, ---------------------------------------------------

loop,counter,value,higher,stuck..
when i put my loop counter variable pagessent in the watch window it gets optmized when i declare as volatile it still gets optimized but when the max value is set to 4 the loop exits properly but if max value is higher than 4 get stuck..

small,assumption,process,faster,loop,q.empty
as long as the dataframe is small your assumption that the put process is faster than the get seems true we can fetch all 5 items within one loop of while not q.empty

requests, second, bucket, ---------------------------------------------------

performance,considerations,requests,second
at very high speeds amazon s3 does have some recommended request rate and performance considerations but this is only when making more than 300 put list delete requests per second or more than 800 get requests per second for a particular bucket

rate,bucket,requests,second
i m not sure if this is the answer but states that if you expect a rapid increase in the request rate for a bucket to more than 300 put list delete requests per second or more than 800 get requests per second we recommend that you open a support case to prepare for the workload and avoid any temporary limits on your request rate

rate,bucket,requests,second
if you expect a rapid increase in the request rate for a bucket to more than 300 put list delete requests per second or more than 800 get requests per second we recommend that you open a support case to prepare for the workload and avoid any temporary limits on your request rate

file, command, complex, ---------------------------------------------------

large,file,command,slower
as i am benchmarking my cluster i discover that for large file my get command is actually slower than put command

complex,file,look,edtftpj
if you need to do anything more complex than put file or get file take a look at edtftpj free

better, js, map, ---------------------------------------------------

better,.js,vendor,folder
is that better than just get the .js already compiled and put it on vendor folder

method,better,webservice
right now i would have to say the put method is better since it works and i could not get the webservice to work

better,map
if you will only use put remove get it s better to choose map

better,helper
you need to put all of your code in your get do block or better in a helper file module

time, entries, hashmap, ---------------------------------------------------

entries,hashmap,slower,time
first thing that came to mind was that it was caused of too many entries in the hashmap which caused every put and every get to be slower every time

homework,time,precis,quicker
i m currently in school and usually spend my time here on stackoverflow looking for answers to homework this time i d thought that perhaps i ll put my code here and maybe i ll get help more precis and quicker

others---------------------------------------------------

network,latency,requests,time,byte,post
network latency is ruled out because get requests take more or less same time as local machine whereas time taken to first byte is more for post and put requests

multi-index,values,higher
i m struggling to know how to put it back together with the multi-index and then how to get the 2016 values that were either higher or lower than the min max already recorded

infowindow,html,content
if you want to get more out of infowindow and put html content in them i would recommend trying infobox

worse,tests,specflow
i m concerned this is going to get worse as we put more tests into the specflow project

odata,efficient,fields,data,field,b,validation,exception
i believe what s happening is that odata uses merge verb that is more efficient than put put requires sending all fields while merge sends only changed data but in your model field b is marked as required so you get a validation exception on the client side

user-agents,post,difficult,different,users
from an interface design standpoint you want user-agents to make post and put and delete more difficult than get or at least distinctly different so that users can rely on that difference to hint when their actions might cause a change in the resource state because they are responsible for those changes

aws,stunnel,ssd,drives,primary,device,ridiculous,read,systems,faster,rds
we even setup replicas outside aws using stunnel and put ssd drives as the primary block device and we get ridiculous read speeds for our reporting systems - literally 100 times faster than we get from rds

donald,trump,sender,money
if you put donald trump on it as sender you might get sued for more money than you can imagine

header,likely,file,headers
anything you put in a header is likely to appear twice when compiling a single file because headers often get included by other headers so they get included more than once

doesnt
here i just put the code within each case and the code doesnt get called more then once

frequent
you got at least put and delete although they are used much less frequent than get and post as in hardly ever

main,method,program,jframe,gui
the main method does little more than to get the program running here to create a jframe to put the main gui code s jpanel in and then display that jframe

uniq,output,class,command
if you want to do more than just get the uniq output you could put your own java class or command line program rather than use usr bin uniq

value
for example if i put 40 as value there will i get charged more

easier,set,size
is there any easier way than put all in set and get set size

google,apps,files
so it s really odd because google penalizes the apps that do put all their code files in and update frequently because these get checked more often

addendum,earlier,little,bit,barry,houdini
addendum i didn t get to add earlier this little bit is what i would have put before seeing barry houdini s answer

swagger,list-without-search,list+search,post,page,documentation,latter
i resorted to split the two in swagger list-without-search as get and list+search as post just to put the page in the swagger documentation also if the latter actually works also as get

html,json,post,appropriate,ways,bad,uses,harder
bowler is pretty much scalatra + scalate with some enforcing nudging of the developer towards good restful practices such as proper use of content-type and accept http headers for responding and emitting html and json and dealing with get post delete and put in appropriate ways and making bad uses of get and delete harder

detailed,route,generic,one
you should also put the more detailed route first so it will not get swallowed by more generic one

place,effort,mac,port,wiki,guides,better,distro
buggy plugins -- even if the plugin exists across all operating systems like flash generally they work best on windows and then linux and mac fight it out for second place usually more effort put into the mac port but on linux there may be wiki guides to get it working better and the distro packagers may use these tricks when auto-installing the plugin for you

attempt,links,error
however if i attempt to put or paste with more links than currently exist i get the following error

common,server
get and post are relatively common put is less common so may not be covered in your server implementation

parts,stack,difficult,new,historical,data,storage
the data collection and storage parts of that stack are already done and i just need to get querying done made more difficult by the fact that the new system queries can take 10+ seconds to complete but can be queried on any dimension and a tool to process the historical data and put it into the new storage engine

functions,data
and then i saw that they put functions under transform that did much more than just get data

plan,struggle,faster,better,hardware
given the explain plan you posted i suspect you ll probably struggle to get it to run any faster unless you put run on better hardware with faster cpu

loop
to get your code to run more than once put it in a while loop

resource,user,information
the idea is that the server generally has more information about the resource than the user and so get might return more information than is required for put

lower,itâ,likely
if you put -c lower than 80 itâ s going to make it less likely that you get

videos,s3,data,limits,20gb
i m try to host videos on s3 and to put data transfer limits so i don t get charged for more than say 20gb any way to do that

good,practice,brackets,easier,complex
but its a good practice to always put the brackets to help making your code easier to read so you wouldn t get confused in more complex algorithms

object,appropriate
if you can still get the object after i don t think i would use delete but put may be more appropriate


however i m not sure how to get these working or more importantly where to put them

button,row,event,id
i have put a button for each row which i want to create on click event for it to get the id of that row and be able to send user to second page to edit that row info but i have problem with checking this multiple button if it were checkbox it was easier

content,article,tag,text,read
one way is to just output the content of the article and put a read more tag in the text and you ll get the text outputted with the read more button after it

pre-aggregation,counters,expensive
pre-aggregation with counters requires 1 get + 1 put which is more expensive than just puts

wrong,session,login,oswap,privilege,level
now don t get me wrong regenerating the session id on login or more accurately as oswap put it on privilege level change is indeed a very good defense against session fixation

zilch,someone,.parse,function,newer,days
i basically know zilch of java but i m hoping someone can help me put something into that .parse function that would get me post that have dateupdated newer than 5 days

dummy,joptionpane,areas,balls,screen
i put dummy joptionpane pop-ups in various areas to confirm my code was getting there and it appears it is all executing but no balls ever get drawn much less drawn over and over to make them move and bounce around the screen

place,app.xaml
if it is something that is used in more than one place or even something that might get used more than once then put it in app.xaml

single,ingredient,query,recipes
also i can do a single ingredient but how would i put together a query to get recipes given more than one ingredient

boolean,corresponding,functions,user,better,public,bjarne
from this point of view if a class has members which don t need to be protected for example a boolean which its corresponding get set functions can be freely changed by the user is better to put that attributes as public and remove the get set functions more or less these are the bjarne stroustrup words

line,spacing,page,multiple,statements
2 in my office there s a lot of lack of line spacing because you get to see more of the code on one page that way. they also put multiple statements on one line and over imho use

black,image,white,gradient
i get black image and if i put start more then 0 i got white gradient but no image

information,better,nothing,free,partial,answers
any information i can get would be better than nothing so please feel free to put in partial answers

matter,pages,next,links,stop,item
it s no matter what limit i put it create more less pages i can navigate between them with next and prev links but all this stop working when i trying to get 31+ item

slider,work,better,slider.js,chrome
but the slider won t work well it doesn t get activated is a better way to put it if i insert the code from slider.js into the chrome console hit enter - booom works perfectly i ve been looking for what the problem might be tried adding the type text javascript in the script tags added the document .ready in my jquery still nothing.

address,rest,bit,member,last,ones,mac
i have been thinking about something after the master makes de inquiry and paging process when up to 7 devices are set as active members active member address and the rest up to 256 are put on parked more 8 bit parked member address or hold or sniff this two last ones doesnt get a mac

topological,sort,value,number,vertices
this should be producing a topological sort but so far i consistently get one value less than i put in as far as number of vertices and none of the number match those i ve inputted

implementations,limit,throughput,certain,actor,minute
what implementations allow me to put a limit on the throughput that is guarantee that a certain actor does not get executed more than n times per minute
