lesser,global,argsort
one way would be to fill the diagonal elements with something lesser than global minimum and then use argsort -

draw,area,shorter,pixels,value,flatness,square,sine
even with 32 levels of recusions it will never explode in a rectangular draw area whose diagonal is shorter than 2 32 pixels the limit would be reached only if you are splitting a virtual bezier in a virtually infinite space with floating-point coordinates but you don t intend to draw it directly because you won t have the 1 2 pixel limitation in such space and only if you have set an extreme value for the flatness such that your minimum square sine constant parameter is 1 2 32 or lower
