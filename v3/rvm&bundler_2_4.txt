better,application,rbenv-gemset,results,gemsets,favors
bundler is a better way to manage application dependencies. there is a plugin rbenv-gemset for getting the same results as rvm s gemsets but sam clearly favors using bundler instead

work,passenger,gemsets,opinion,deployment,better
you can also read up on how to make rvm work with passenger 3 it might be transferrable to 4 with gemsets though in my opinion using bundler deployment is much better option

others---------------------------------------------------

files,gemfile,directive
rvm supports more then just .rvmrc one of this files is gemfile with either the bundler directive to specify ruby

need,work,thing,harder
there is no need to do anything to make bundler work with rvm but there is one thing about bundler that makes it harder to use
