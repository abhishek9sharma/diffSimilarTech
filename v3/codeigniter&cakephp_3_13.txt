yii, libraries, lower, ---------------------------------------------------

frameworks,yii,smaller,learning
if you employ php frameworks like codeigniter yii maybe even cakephp which have comparatively smaller learning curves you will find your path wellpaved for you in php

frameworks,libraries,auto-generating
depending on how much you used cakephp you may need to realize that frameworks other than codeigniter often have more libraries and auto-generating funcionality is that the right word

lower,learning,curve
codeigniter has the lower learning curve overall so i would recommend it over cakephp

others---------------------------------------------------

opinion,easier,someone,experienced,wrong
in my opinion it will probably be easier to integrate with codeigniter although someone more experienced with cakephp might prove me wrong

heavy,framework,category,lighter,zend
i personally use codeigniter which probably falls in to the heavy framework category but is at least much lighter than cakephp and lighter than zend too i think

hip,zendframework,symfony,flow3,favourable
cakephp is very hip zendframework is widely used although more of a all-purpose component library yet i personally believe symfony flow3 and codeigniter to be more favourable

suspect,flexible,structure,smaller,lighter,quick,look,manual,behaviors
i suspect codeigniter doesn t have quite as flexible a structure it s smaller and lighter than cakephp but a quick look at the cakephp manual to see how behaviors components helpers and the vendors folder may be helpful

slower,speed
cakephp is considered slower than codeigniter but you can tweak it to enhance speed

complicated
i have been reading about cakephp but it seems a bit more complicated than codeigniter

newer,feature,rich,heavier,smaller,footprint,likely,functionality,cake
cakephp is newer more feature rich and heavier than codeigniter codeigniter is designed to have a much smaller footprint so you will most likely find yourself creating functionality in codeigniter to match cake s

view,lighter,judge
in my view cakephp seems much more lighter then codeigniter but i never used either one so i can t judge

harder,new,mvc
why do people say cakephp is somewhat harder than codeigniter for people new to mvc

yii,complex,documentation,informative,understandable
i am currently looking at yii and while its more complex than codeigniter the documentation is much more informative and therefore understandable than cakephp s
