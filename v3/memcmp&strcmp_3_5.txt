simpler, faster, parts, ---------------------------------------------------

simpler,places,strings
memcmp is simpler than strcmp and can be implemented even more efficiently in places where the strings are known to be properly aligned

cleaner,parts
strcmp also works but memcmp is cleaner if you are comparing parts of two arrays together as my ip value had an octet stored in different indexes so i could easily just use the size 4 to cover 0 to 3 indexes

strings,lengths,faster
if you always keep track of the lengths of your strings you can compare lengths and use memcmp which is faster than strcmp

others---------------------------------------------------

rest,better,general,string,comparisons
rest assured though that strcmp is better equipped in the general case for string comparisons than memcmp is

functions,strncmp,similar,safer
note also the functions strncmp and memcmp which are similar to strcmp but are safer
