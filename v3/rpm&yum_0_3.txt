easier,groups,machines
yum makes it easier to maintain groups of machines without having to manually update each one using rpm

answer,program,packages,intelligent,management
to expand on the udo s answer there is the program rpm which manipulates specifically the packages it is asked to manipulate and there is yum which is a more intelligent management system that can find dependencies and download .rpm files even if they re not in the system

commands,difference,output,bigger,-qa,package,dependencies
both commands works in the same way only difference is yum list installed output maybe bigger than rpm -qa because yum will show package dependencies also in its output
