earlier, bit, operators, ---------------------------------------------------

strlen,bit,greater,length
when converted to unsigned -1 becomes 2 32 - 1 assuming that strlen returns a 32 bit integer which is greater than the length of the string you are comparing with

value,use,operators,faster
the idea here is threefold readability using operator functions with compatible left and right arguments as well as return value and the use of integer multiplying operators being faster than unsigned operators

value,bigger,flow,fibbonaci
in fact your going to get a value bigger than an integer can hold 4 billion unsigned 2 billion signed before the stack is going to over flow fibbonaci 46

input,larger,long
the problem is that the input integer is larger than what would fit in an unsigned long long

texture,natural,use
and by the way are you sure you need a signed integer texture as unsigned would be much more natural for your use case

values,greater,16-bit
string.fromcharcode won t work correctly with values greater than 0xffff more than an unsigned 16-bit integer

value,larger,bit,string
it s interesting and probably relevant that the value is larger than an unsigned 64 bit integer but since the value is a string this is theoretically legal

earlier,byte,greater,maximum
earlier i was getting unsigned byte integer is greater than maximum but not every single time and not this time

implementation, promotions, size, ---------------------------------------------------

types,useful
furthermore signed integer types just tend to be more useful than unsigned types

native,size,smaller,cachedarr,sizeof,int
if the native integer size was smaller than 64-bit you could use the same theory but you d have to loop over the array sizeof cachedarr sizeof unsigned int times

compiler,conversion,int,better,pointer
as far as the compiler is concerned the conversion from integer 0 to unsigned int is no better than the conversion from integer 0 to pointer

types,narrower,int
integer types both signed and unsigned which are strictly narrower than an int are converted to a signed int

bigger,type,right,size,typedef,version,useful
it might even be bigger than any integer type but if there is some integer type which is the right size and you that integer type will be typedef d to intptr_t and its unsigned version probably more useful will be uintptr_t

minimum,64bit,sign,equal,bigger,size,long,int
both of following types are semantically equivalent minimum 64bit integer without sign and with equal or bigger size than unsigned long int

64-bit,platforms,range
as we move to 64-bit platforms the unsigned range of a signed integer should be more than enough for most purposes

implementation,type,pointers,bigger
an implementation that has no such unsigned type say because pointers are bigger than any integer type won t provide it

64-bit,type,compiler
an unsigned 64-bit integer type requires compiler support which your compiler lacks so you cannot create it sorry

promotions,place,type,smaller,int,promotion
instead default argument promotions take place which means that any integer type smaller than int unsigned int gets converted to one of those -- that s not the only promotion but the only one relevant here -- and which also means that there is no automatic conversion to whatever type you specify with va_arg

conversion,routine,warning,input,value,greater
the integer to unsigned conversion routine to_unsigned can produce a warning if the input integer value is greater than can be expressed in the number of bits specified 6 so the result is clamped to 6 bits with the mod operator

compiler,type,wider
it can only disappoint you if your compiler has an integer type wider than unsigned long long and you use it

int,32-bit,type,ushort,16-bit,precise
it would be ok to use int in your case that is a signed 32-bit integer type but it looks like ushort unsigned 16-bit is more precise here

pedantic,note,types,wider,int,final,computed
pedantic note when printing integer types that might wider than int unsigned insure the final computed result matches the specifier

system,int,larger,greater,type,short
on your system unsigned int is apparently larger than uint16_t int is a greater ranked integer type than short in the standard 6.3.1.1 even if they are of the same size

chux,comment,larger,uint32_t,usual,promotions
1 as chux has noted in a comment if unsigned is larger than uint32_t arithmetic on uint32_t goes through the usual integer promotions and if not it stays as uint32_t

object,type,int,rank,equal,field
an object with an integer type other than int and signed int whose integer rank is less than or equal to the rank of int and unsigned int a bit field of type _bool int signed int or unsigned int

variations,type,bytes,memory,architecture,short,values
according the books the variations of type integer occupy more or less bytes of memory depending on the architecture however the type unsigned short values â â can get up to 65 535 since the type unsigned long 4 294 967 295

promotions,smaller,int,is.
integer promotions turn anything smaller than an int into either an int or an unsigned int and leave everything else as is.

lesser,precision,promotions,possible,uint64_t,int,range
this means in effect that types cannot be demoted to a type with lesser precision by the integer promotions it is possible for uint64_t to be promoted to int or unsigned int but only if the range of the type is at least that of uint64_t

types,stronger,ones,signed.
in general floating point types are stronger than integer ones and unsigned are stronger than signed.

gcc,type,larger,pointer
here is how gcc does it it sign extends if the integer type is larger than the pointer type this ll happen regardless of the integer being signed or unsigned just because that s how gcc decided to implements it

others---------------------------------------------------

higher,assembly,variables,quality
in most higher-level languages higher than assembly integer variables have a quality of being signed or unsigned

value,positive,smaller,absolute,negative,output,complement
but if the inputs had a pair integers where the absolute value of the positive integer was smaller than the absolute value of the negative integer then the output was what you would expect from unsigned 2 s complement

final,bit,overflow,last,easier,arithmetic,need
after analysing your code there is a final unsigned 32 bit integer overflow in the last multiplication by 10 you multiplying by 10 not by 2 so you can get up to four new bits in each multiplication making it easier for an overflow even if you do unsigned arithmetic which is recommended so you don t need to play with the signs

number,pn,better
note you will need 2 bytes the represent any port number so pn 16 integer or pn 16 unsigned will be better
