shape,window,better
i m creating a program which has a settings menu in the shape of another window this used to be a qmainwindow but i read that a qdialog would work better for this so i manually converted the qmainwindow into a qdialog window

docking,area,functionality,sensible,base
if you re not using qmainwindow s docking area functionality a qdialog would be a more sensible base class to use
