results,image,little,bit,blurrier
the results end up very close but the emgucv image comes out a little bit blurrier than the opencv image

faster,server,c#,slower
unless you re doing very heavy processing working with a single frame is probably faster than transferring it to the server as far as i know emgucv in c# isn t considerably slower than opencv in c c++
