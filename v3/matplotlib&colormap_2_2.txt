endpoints, data, values, ---------------------------------------------------

data,single,pcolormesh,values,range,midpoint,rgb
to allow you to scale down the data away from 0 and 1 i had to do this when combining colormap in matplotlib single pcolormesh with more than one colormap using matplotlib so you can likely see how the code works but basically say you have values -5 1 10 in a sample but want to normalize based on a range of -7 to 7 so anything above 7 our 10 is treated as a 7 effectively with a midpoint of 2 but shrink it to fit a 256 rgb colormap
