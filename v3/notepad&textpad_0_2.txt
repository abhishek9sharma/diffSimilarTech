windows,machine,programmers,spell,checker,better,measure
on windows machine i would probably go with textpad personally i now use programmers notepad 2 however it does not support a spell checker and i don t really thinks it s better than textpad by any measure

advanced,able
as it happens my choice is textpad but just about anything which is more advanced than notepad ought to be able to do this
