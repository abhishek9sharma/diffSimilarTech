ttl,message,limitations,nats,error
in fact icmp especially the ttl excceeding message has even less limitations than udp on nats for the error message can be sent from every corner of the internet and routers with nat cannot be aware that these messages are not the true ones

packet,header,bytes,slower
an icmp packet has a header that is 20 bytes and is probably going to be slightly slower than udp

algorithm,ttl,packets,old,school,newer,implementations
mere algorithm has something to do with ttl on udp packets old school and icmp echo in newer implementations
