careful,second,column,comma,better
be careful with writing as csv because your second column now has comma in it so tsv may be better

format
i think that generally csv are supported more often than the tsv format

tab,separated,values,built-in,module,data
tsv tab separated values so the built-in csv module is more than enough to export your data

easier,columns
it seems you could use tsv instead of csv to produce easier to visualise columns separated by tab

tab,comma
also your csv looks more like a tsv tab separated instead of comma separated
