low-level,better,web,framework
however unless you want to write some low-level node.js code to better understand this language i highly recommend using node.js web framework such as express

coffescript,jade
i have a node.js app built using coffescript on express connect jade less

sinatra,bottle,better,fit
one could argue that a lighter framework such as sinatra if you re going to use ruby or something like bottle python or the javascript stack of node.js + express would be a better fit if you truly are just going to create a restful api + some landing pages but rails does this perfectly fine as well and has a lot of other functionality that will be available for you to grow into if the time ever comes

bad,idea,requirement,uniqueness,apache-php,following,better,.the,application,framework,scratch,easy,tutorials,basics,expressjs
first its not a bad idea to use node.js to satisfy your requirement the uniqueness of node and added advantage compared to conventional technologies like apache-php is clearly explained in this following video why node.js is better .the notion of node being just used for advanced or complex applications is wrong you can use node for building applications which are very simple to anything of huge proportion.it would be a not so comfortable task for a node beginner to code without using any frameworks but by using this web application framework called express you need not code from scratch and its very easy to setup html pages using its simplified html templating language called jade and route requests also you can even use your html pages if you are not willing to use jade for rendering the views of your application .here are the series of tutorials which would help you tutorials on beginning with node.js basics of expressjs

nginx,purpose,core,module,http,natural,webserver
so nginx will work for this purpose but if you have made a node.js app the core module http optionally paired with express would be a more natural choice of webserver

socket.io,faster,chat
i found node.js and used it along with socket.io and express to create a faster chat application
