margin-auto,page,ul,entire,nothing,center
margin-auto works for elements with a width that is less than the page width in this case the ul is taking the entire width so there is nothing to center text-align center for the ul and display inline-block are the solution in this case

you just need to use text-align right on the labels with a width that is slightly greater than the label text as the text will be lined up at the extreme right end
