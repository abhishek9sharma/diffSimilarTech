alternative, work, behaviour, ---------------------------------------------------

work,better
it should also be noted that mouseenter and mouseleave work somewhat differently and usually much better than mouseover and mouseout

better,behaviour
in this case mouseenter mouseleave has better behaviour and prevents bubbling compared to mouseover mouseout

idea,better,alternative
i have no idea about the classes but i think mouseenter and mouseleave are better alternative for mouseout and mouseover

others---------------------------------------------------

reliable
imho mouseenter and mouseleave are much more reliable than mouseover and mouseout which tend to flicker

use
because jquery doesn t use mouseover and mouseout it uses mouseenter and mouseleave which are more suited to this scenario

reliable
also you might want to use mouseenter and mouseleave which are sanitized by jquery and are a little more reliable than mouseover and mouseout

better,ones,.hover,method
also instead of mouseover and mouseout use the better ones mouseenter and mouseleave or simply the .hover method
