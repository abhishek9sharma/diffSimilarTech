flexibility,bunch,static,dialogs
usually when people want more flexibility than joptionpane offers it s basically a bunch of static factories for a few dialogs they write their own dialogs using jdialog

size,function,getsize,bit,smaller,button
i m trying to make a jdialog with the size of the joptionpane that contains but function getsize is returning something a little bit smaller than the joptionpane and the button of accept is not seen

part,processing,getwindowforcomponent,argument,general
as part of the processing joptionpane invokes getwindowforcomponent on the argument before passing it through to the underlying jdialog which is slightly more general

better,number
using jdialog instead of joptionpane is better to put number of data
