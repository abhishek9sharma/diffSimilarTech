libxslt,api
also since lxml is based on libxml2 and libxslt you ll need less calls into the c api which can be quite expensive in my experience

nicer,interface,elementtree,benefit,speed
lxml uses libxml2 and provides a nicer interface the elementtree so you get most of the benefit of libxml2 s speed and all of the benefit of it s xpath evaluation

third,party,interface,full,xpath
the chapter starts with short course to xml general talk but with the atom syndication feed example then it continues with the standard xml.etree.elementtree and continues with third party lxml that implements more with the same interface full xpath 1.0 based on libxml2

libxslt,lower-level,bindings,straightforward,pythonic
libxml2 libxslt also come with their own much lower-level python bindings but lxml is much more straightforward and pythonic and it seems to have great performance as well
