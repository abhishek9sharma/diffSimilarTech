greater, return, integer, ---------------------------------------------------

easy,subtraction,multiplication,random,tricky
i found it fairly easy to generate addition subtraction and multiplication questions at random however division is more tricky

multiplication,higher,precedence,subtraction,extraneous
finally we all know that multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction so we can remove the extraneous parentheses so this turns into

subtraction,multiplication
the addition and subtraction are much more than multiplication and division

basics,multiplication,higher,subtraction,esoteric
i know the basics division and multiplication higher than addition and subtraction but i would have to look up something more esoteric

intuition,subtraction,faster,multiplication,correct
the intuition would say addition subtraction are faster than multiplication division but is that really correct

multiplication,modulo,precedence,higher,subtraction
multiplication division and modulo have the same precedence and they all have higher precedence than addition and subtraction

calculation,return,subtraction,multiplication,testing,easier
it is also possible to manipulate the inputs so that various parts of the calculation return 0 for addition or subtraction or 1 for multiplication or division to make testing easier but this only gets me so far

multiplication,slower,subtraction,c#
i don t understand why the division multiplication in c++ is so much slower than addition subtraction where the managed c# version is more reasonable to my expectations

multiplication,higher,precedence,subtraction,parentheses
division multiplication has higher precedence than addition subtraction and parentheses is required to do addition subtraction before multiplication division

operations,subtraction,faster,integer,multiplication
typically operations like addition and subtraction are much faster in integer -- multiplication and division less so

multiplication,operators,higher,precedence,subtraction,scientific
multiplication and division operators have higher precedence than addition and subtraction in c++ same as in scientific notation

multiplication,higher,priority,subtraction
multiplication and division have higher priority than addition and subtraction

multiplication,higher,precedence,subtraction
multiplication and division have a higher precedence than addition and subtraction

higher,precedence,subtraction,operators,multiplication
this is happening because the concatenation operator has a higher precedence than the addition or subtraction operators but multiplication and division have a higher precedence then concatenation

multiplication,expensive,subtraction
multiplication is more expensive than addition subtraction and division is more expensive still

multiplication,subtraction
apart from that multiplication is addition done more than once and division is subtraction done more than once

precedence,multiplication,greater,subtraction
i don t think they have a natural precedence unlike say multiplication and division being of greater precedence than subtraction and addition because they can be built from subtraction and addition

variation,multiplication,subtraction
in general you ll have more variation with multiplication and division than with addition and subtraction

integer,multiplication,modulo,slower,subtraction
integer multiplication division and modulo are much slower than integer addition and subtraction

multiplication,higher,precedence,subtraction
to start with i need multiplication and division to take higher precedence than addition and subtraction

rule,multiplication,precedence,subtraction
nothing follows the rule of multiplication and division having more precedence over addition and subtraction

operations,simple,multiplication,subtraction,powers
the operations are always algebraically simple never involving anything more than addition multiplication subtraction division and taking powers

multiplication,costly,easy,modulo
implementing multiplication and division might be more costly than you would like but at least addition is easy modulo protecting against over underflow and you claim to not need any operations so even better

single-precision,multiplication,longer,subtraction
the term is apparently not an exact measurement as it is clear that a double-precision floating-point operation is going to take longer than a single-precision one and multiplication and division are going to take longer than addition and subtraction

expensive,multiplication,powers,exponent,subtraction,range
it will be much slower i don t have benchmarks but i would guess at least an order of magnitude maybe more decimal will not benefit from any hardware acceleration and arithmetic on it will require relatively expensive multiplication division by powers of 10 which is far more expensive than multiplication and dividion by powers of 2 to match the exponent before addition subtraction and to bring the exponent back into range after multiplication division

cycles, example, time, ---------------------------------------------------

time
i remember it says something like division takes much much more time than addition

example,cycles,time
best example the division it an an addition are both o 1 but usually the division takes far more cycles time to execute than the addition

others---------------------------------------------------

subtraction,level,logic,slower
division is performed by repeated subtraction therefore needs more level of subtract logic making division slower than addition

faster,multiplication
an addition is faster than a division and a multiplication

dependency,problems,faster
so if your code has tough data dependency problems addition is about 12 times faster than division

grammar,multiplication,operations,lower,parse,tree,subtraction
notice that by making the rule for contain the rule for this grammar makes sure all multiplication division operations occur lower in the parse tree than any addition subtraction

operations,faster,several,multiplication
on simple low-cost processors typically bitwise operations are substantially faster than division several times faster than multiplication and sometimes significantly faster than addition

larger,complexity
and division has larger complexity than addition

higher,precedence
division has higher precedence than addition

cheaper,operations,modulo,array,access
the addition is much cheaper than other operations like modulo and division and array access

faster
for example an addition is typically much faster than a division

simulations,things,square,roots,expensive
if you are doing physical simulations things like division or square roots are going to be way more expensive than addition

higher,precedence,sumaverage1+,sumaverage2,integer
the division has higher precedence than the addition so what you re calculating is sumaverage1+ sumaverage2 5 which is integer division which is probably not what you want

operator,higher,precendence,function
the division operator has a higher precendence than the addition operator so your function is calculating 1 1 + e -x

systems,64-bit,faster,32-bit,modulo
for example on most 32 bit systems 64-bit addition is faster than 32-bit division modulo

point,operations,subtraction,harder,multiplication,slower,transistor
for floating point operations addition and subtraction are harder than multiplication and division so they may be slower or not again it depends on how much transistor real estate there is dedicated to the fpu

matter,64-bit,faster,32-bit
for that matter 64-bit addition might be faster than 32-bit addition and 32-bit division faster than 64-bit division

operator,higher,precedence
this happens because the division operator has higher precedence than the + addition operator

multiplication,higher,precedence,first,implicit
multiplication and division are higher precedence than addition so they get done first - before the implicit conversion to string for concatenation

expensive,integer,kernel,intuitive
you could also have dispatched a 1d grid and wrapped it to a 2d grid yourself but using a 2d thread position can save you an expensive integer division in the kernel in addition to being more intuitive

modulo,operation,slower
it is true that division and modulo a division operation is slower than addition

expensive,multiplication,number,operations,trial,limit,small
so even disregarding that division is more expensive than addition and multiplication we see that the number of operations the sieve requires is much smaller than the number of operations required by trial division if the limit is not too small

higher,precedence
division has a higher precedence than addition ergo

higher,precedence,integer
since division has a higher precedence than addition 5 2 gets evaluated as a integer division returning 2 as an integer

first,difference,expensive
the first difference is that division is much more expensive than addition

e.g,loop,calculation,time
for e.g if i do an addition vs division in a loop will the calculation time for addition be less than that for division

operator,higher,precedence,sum
the division operator has a higher precedence than the addition operator + so you need to enclose the sum with brackets before dividing

operation,faster,gpu
i need to find out that how much division operation is faster than addition operation in a gpu

larger,type,faster,modulo
performing addition on this slightly larger type will pretty much always be faster than doing division or modulo on the type itself

parentheses,redundant,multiplication,priority,higher,precedence
note parentheses are redundant as division and multiplication have the same priority and modulo has higher precedence over addition

preferable,computers,subtraction,binary,arithmetic,simpler
knuth writes that fibonacci search is preferable on some computers because it involves only addition and subtraction not division by 2. but almost all computers use binary arithmetic in which division by 2 is simpler than addition and subtraction

worse,latency,multiplication,factor,modern
division has worse latency than multiplication or addition by a factor of 2 to 4 on modern x86 cpus and worse throughput by a factor of 6 to 40

bit,shift,operation,slower
2.the division by 2 can be done by bit - shift operation is it really slower than addition

work,arrays
in addition to that the crossing off may be less work than a division don t know about python it is for c arrays

complex,slower,operations,incorrect
as far as i know the division is more complex and slower than other operations like addition so is my code incorrect then

operator,higher,order,precedence
the division operator has a higher order precedence as the addition operator

multiplication,higher,precedence
division and multiplication have higher precedence than addition so what this is actually doing is

subtraction,okay,point,arithmetic,brackets
the addition and subtraction is okay because the types of a and b force them to be performed using floating point arithmetic - but because division binds more tightly than addition and subtraction it s like using the brackets above only the immediate operands are considered

sort,calculator,multiplication,highest,mean,time,subtraction,lower
put each token +- of final command string in a list maybe a binary tree works and sort that list to tell the calculator that division and multiplication has the highest priority in the mean time addition and subtraction has lower priority

work,sequential,multiplication,expensive
this means the work is sequential addition not multiplication not division which are much more expensive

note,higher,precedence
note that division has a higher precedence than addition

length,number,remainder,modulo,important,slower
then you can process any length number using very few division remainder modulo operations which is important because they are much slower than addition

multiplication,higher,precedence,parentheses
but that s not the case here since division and multiplication have higher precedence than addition and there are no parentheses involved

careful,optimization,faster
with careful optimization however you can make addition 61 times faster than division

result,expression,interesting,multiplication,fma,single
however if the result a is added to or subtract from another expression and not reused then starting with the division may be more interesting since you can group the multiplication with the following addition by using a fma thus with a single rounding

modulo,costly,compilers,slower
division and modulo are indeed costly hardware operations whatever you do this is more related to hardware architecture than to languages or compilers perhaps ten times slower than addition

expensive,multiplication
you should expect a division to be a bit more expensive than a multiplication and a multiplication to be lot more expensive than an addition

faster,multiplication
also addition is faster than multiplication and multiplication is faster than division

slower,bitwise,operation
it could be done via division which is much slower than addition or it could be translated into a bitwise and operation as well and end up being just as fast as the version

higher,precedence,subtraction
division has a higher precedence than addition or subtraction so it s really this

cycles,slower,slow
i think it is a few cycles slower than addition but yes division is very slow compared to the others

costly,difference
generally the division is more costly than addition i think but not much difference in this case
