setup,easier,macport,port,install,+ssl,ssl-breaking,bug,suffers
i actually found the setup of nginx much easier than lighttpd not to mention that you can install a macport of nginx port install nginx +ssl that does not contain the ssl-breaking bug that lighttpd suffers from here

fastcgi,better,perception
i was also going to recommend nginx + fastcgi as i prefer nginx to lighttpd it s better mantained or at least that s been my perception the last few years

server,apache,easier,configuration
using a different server such as one apache and one nginx or one apache and one lighttpd will be much easier because their configuration files don t conflict with each other

scripts,apache,comfortable,small
let√¢ s encrypt provides great scripts for apache 2 and nginx but not lighttpd which is much more comfortable for small systems like raspberry pi or old boxes

benchmark,little,bit,better,bigger,static,contents,good
according to this benchmark nginx is a little bit better than lighttpd for serving bigger static contents so nginx would be a good choice for static flv video contents

certain,paths,different,port,data,resources
you could do something like configure a reverse proxy for certain paths in lighttpd to go to a different port which nginx owns but this will still push all the data through lighttpd and just use more resources than having lighttpd serve it directly

webserver,majority,able,faster
nginx seems to be the webserver getting the majority of the buzz lately it may be able to serve faster than lighttpd maybe not

simple,lightweight
it s simple and nginx is even more ridiculously fast and lightweight than lighttpd

cherrypy,fast,memcached,faster
shortly put running some benchmarks on a page doing some database operations and serving static dynamic content has shown that plain cherrypy was twice as fast than nginx and memcached and about half faster than lighttpd
