convenient, memcpy, strcpy, ---------------------------------------------------

malloc,memcpy
because of the above replace strdup with strlen malloc memcpy memcpy is slightly faster than strcpy

convenient,malloc,strcpy
additionally if you have strdup then it is much more convenient than strlen + malloc + strcpy with identical result including the same obligation to free the allocated storage when you no longer need it

others---------------------------------------------------

separate,original,simpler,malloc,call
you can use either to create a new memory block which is separate from the original but naturally strdup is simpler since it doesn t require a separate malloc strlen call

willing,posix,cleaner,malloc,semantics
as i noted in comments however if you re willing to rely on posix s strdup then that s cleaner than strlen + malloc + and has the same semantics you take responsibility for freeing the memory allocated for the copy
