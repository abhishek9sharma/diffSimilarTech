animation,correct,support,animated,transitions
finally i haven t done much with animation but i think you re entirely correct - d3.js provides more animation support than protovis especially in terms of animated transitions

result,little,lower-level,syntax,things
the result is that using d3.js can feel a little lower-level - you have more control but you have to be pretty familiar with svg syntax to do some of the things protovis does much more easily

new,development,newer
i m new to protovis although it is no longer under development and d3.js is the newer software

team,better
the team behind protovis has since created d3.js so this is likely a better option than protovis

semantic,notice,faster
for semantic zooming you ll notice that d3.js is significantly faster than protovis
