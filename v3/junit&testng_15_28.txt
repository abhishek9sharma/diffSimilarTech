solution, params, extension, ---------------------------------------------------

extension,similar,better,solution
if there is a junit extension or similar framework that provides a better solution than testng then please let me know

params,convenient,solution
go with junit params or testng which offer much more convenient solution

work, honest, little, ---------------------------------------------------

work,better
not sure if it ll work any better than junit but there is testng

better
isn t testng supposed to a better than junit

easier
if you are familiar of using junit it is easier to switch into testng

easier
i know this can be achieved with junit but in my experience it is easier with testng

little,easier
powermockito might integrate a little easier with testng but i have never used it with junit

honest,popular,work
to be perfectly honest i junit is way more popular than testng at least here where i work and live

testing, integration, framework, ---------------------------------------------------

integartion,testing,easier,features,integration
also for integartion testing i have found testng to be much easier to use that junit because it has features that make writing integration tests easier

testing,framework,bigger,feature,set
in case if you have flexibility to choose another testing framework you can try with testng which has bigger feature set than junit

android,testing,lightweight,on-device
i actually picked junit over testng for android testing i thought it was more lightweight than testng for on-device testing

non-unit,testing,better
if you re doing non-unit testing testng might be a better option than junit

parameterized,testing,stuff,greatest,better
twip for parameterized testing the junit stuff isn t the greatest in fact testng does this better as well -

part,unit,testing,framework
you may want to use junit in the part of unit testing but testng is more than a unite testing framework

capabilities,helpful,integration,tests,unit
testng has more capabilities and can be helpful with integration tests junit is more focused on unit tests

others---------------------------------------------------

test,class,capable,tears
in our approach our test framework extends the standard test case class junit in our case but testng seems more capable that sets up and tears down the various database dependecies with each test using the following steps

power,local,variables,dataprovider,threading
yes with testng you have way more power over those local variables that you did with junit and the dataprovider handles your threading per test-class-instance

flexible
if you have to do a lot of this honestly testng is more flexible but you can absolutely get it done in junit

learning,curve
personally i would recommend testng although if you re just starting junit is slightly less of a learning curve

configurable,end
testng strives to be much more configurable than junit but in the end they both work equally well

friendlier,paradigm
testng is much friendlier to this paradigm than junit though

multi-thread,last,time,better,results
firstly i am not sure how to properly use multi-thread with junit last time i tried i had no success anyway i have had better results with testng

books,references,amazon
edit it seems junit has more printed books as references compared to testng on amazon

contrived,parameters,functions
here is what it would look like with testng it s a little more contrived with junit since you can t pass parameters directly to test functions

options,possibilites,tests,order
testng offers you more options and possibilites how to run your tests and in which order especially something junit can t

direct,simpel,features,complex
junit is more direct and simpel to use if you start to learn java testng has more features but maybe is more complex

older,tests
will testng run my older tests written in junit

flexible,multiple,support
testng is more flexible than junit and have multiple advantages like support for parallel testing for example
