loadview,viewdidload,viewwilllayoutsubviews,viewdidlayoutsubviews,multiple,time
actually as per view life cycle the methods are called in following manner init loadview viewdidload viewwillappear viewwilllayoutsubviews called more than once viewdidlayoutsubviews called multiple time and lastly viewdidappear

suggestion,operation,ugly
suggestion is to put operation in viewdidappear but it also seems to work in viewwillappear and is slightly less ugly

..
in this case viewdidappear behaves more like viewwillappear ..
