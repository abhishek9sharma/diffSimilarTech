you can also check out the open-source miglayout which is much more convenient that gridbaglayout and also a bit more powerful

miglayout works similarly to gridbaglayout but is more powerful and more expressive

others---------------------------------------------------

approach,verbose,easier
same effect but this approach is less verbose unlike in case of gridbaglayout and i personally think that miglayout is easier to use

better,fit,part,standard
it sounds to me like gridbaglayout would be a better fit for you either that or miglayout though you ll have to download that first since it s not part of standard java

clarification,easier,familiar,hard,download
edit for clarification miglayout is probably easier to use than gridbaglayout but if you get familiar with gridbaglayout it s not that hard to use and it doesn t require a download since it s part of the core java library

start,guide,site,difficult,powerful
look at the quick start guide on the miglayout site it s a lot less difficult than gridbaglayout and much more powerful
