html5, icecast, performance, ---------------------------------------------------

icecast,broadcast,better
if you want to cover the largest audience possible set up a streaming server like icecast and broadcast over mp3 and or ogg both is better

better,compression,plus,things
in general ogg achieves better compression than mp3 which is a plus for things like download size bandwidth resource usage etc

support,html5,better
firefox doesn t support mp3 on html5 they support ogg which is better anyway

vorbis,better,bitrates
moreover ogg vorbis is better then mp3 at all bitrates

better,performance
first of all i recommend you to use ogg instead of mp3 has better performance

legal, files, bitrate, ---------------------------------------------------

files,higher,bitrate,loss,quality
mp3 files were of higher bitrate and when converted to ogg ended up in the loss of quality which resulted in the noise

vorbis,better,quality,meg,licensing,legal
ogg vorbis is better quality per meg than mp3 plus no licensing legal issues

others---------------------------------------------------

files,application,amount
i have done it by using ogg files instead of using mp3 files in my application ogg files consumes less amount of memory

devices,issues,files,chip,decoder,best,better
i think there are some devices that could have issues with mp3 files has they haven t the mp3 chip decoder so the best option it s ogg files also ogg usually compress better

smaller
of those three ogg would usually be smaller than mp3

sounds,format,reliable,errors
i originally had the all sounds in mp3 format but after reading that ogg may be more reliable i converted them all to ogg but the errors appeared just the same

worse,results,files,opposite,loop,start,file,seconds
however after attempting multiple times i m actually getting worse results with ogg files than i am with mp3 s - but the problem is the opposite ie when the loop is supposed to go back to the start of the ogg file it actually seems to start again but from about 2 or 3 seconds into it ie no gap it just doesn t loop correctly

stream,mp2,mp1,wav,aiff
stream mp3 mp2 mp1 ogg wav aiff custom generated and more via
