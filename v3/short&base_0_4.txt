descriptive,names,routines,readable,comments,legacy
in fact some would argue that any comment is a code smell and that descriptive names and short routines are more readable and prevent the situation where code has been changed but the comments haven t been updated which has certainly bitten me in a few legacy code base

worse,design,things,class,specific
in short it s worse design to move things to the base class than it is to downcast to the specific class

loop,tighter,ends
as the condition reads a loop can not be zipped tighter if it s either too short less than five base or its ends do not match

version,concrete,easier,child
the short version is that having concrete base classes makes it easier to accidentally slice off your child object use arrays incorrectly
