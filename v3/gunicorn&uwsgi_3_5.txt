production, change, heroku, ---------------------------------------------------

nginx,better,options
as other already suggested nginx + gunicorn or better nginx + uwsgi are better options than apache + mod_python to serve your django app

production,heroku,year,better
i ve been using uwsgi in production on heroku for over a year and it seems to handle everything a lot better than gunicorn

benchmarks,better,performance,change
according to many benchmarks uwsgi seems to provides better performance than gunicorn and if the performance doesn t change significantly you ll be able to focus your investigation on nginx or ec2 configurations

others---------------------------------------------------

easier,simple
i always used uwsgi but realized that gunicorn is easier for simple projects like mine

ambitious,project,sys,admin,easier,common
i sure would like to use uwsgi as it is an ambitious project but at the end of the day i am a developer and not a sys admin and gunicorn is much easier to just get working in the common use cases
