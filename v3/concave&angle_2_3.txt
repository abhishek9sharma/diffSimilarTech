corners, total, corner, ---------------------------------------------------

total,triangle,œhyperbolicâ,surface,shape
if the total of the angle is less than 180â the triangle must be â œhyperbolicâ on a concave surface which might be the shape of our universe

polygon,degrees,corners,corner
you check that the polygon is not concave by simply checking for all angle being less than 180 degrees - any corners which has a angle of over 180 is concave and you need to break it at that corner

edit2,okay,bigger,shape,simple
edit2 okay i just see that if the angle is bigger than 180â it s concave so i have to change the shape for be simple than a triangulation
