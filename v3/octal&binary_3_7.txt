practice, human, ways, ---------------------------------------------------

practice,hex,easier,human
with a little practice hex or octal are easier for a human than binary

hex,shorter,ways
hex and octal are just shorter ways to write binary

conversion,hex,easier
the conversion between binary and either octal or hex is even easier than decimal

others---------------------------------------------------

easy,bits,digit
when converting from binary to octal it s more easy each 3 bits give you 1 digit in octal

hexadecimal,literals,compact,faster,number
because hexadecimal and rarely octal literals are more compact and people using them usually can convert between hexadecimal and binary faster than deciphering a binary number

cannot,larger,equal,decimal
that number cannot be larger than binary 111 which is equal to 7 in both decimal and octal

base,decimal,constants,useful
you ll need to convert binary to another base here i use decimal when writing this code because c doesn t have binary constants which would be ten times more useful than octal constants
