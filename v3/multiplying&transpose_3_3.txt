matrices, non-zero, boost, ---------------------------------------------------

matrix,non-zero,populated,resultant
while your original matrix may contain only 3348026 non-zero elements keep in mind that multiplying the matrix with its transpose may yield a more densely populated resultant matrix

speed,boost,dereference,faster
this seems too deep in the original code so i won t touch it but if there s any possibility of flattening the stored array it will be a speed boost even if you can t transpose it multiplying add dereference is faster than dereference add dereference

matrix,faster,matrices
apparently transpose a matrix then multiplying it is faster than just multiplying the two matrices
