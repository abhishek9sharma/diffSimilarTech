willing,vista,little,simpler
if you are willing to limit yourself to vista or later then direct2d would be a little simpler than direct3d

dead,2d
direct2d is more or less dead nowadays and one would use direct3d also to render 2d

principal,easier,poor,text
direct3d appears in principal to be easier than direct2d but has poor text font handling in the latest version

also--it,layer,top,specific,functionality
as mentioned direct2d is an option also--it is functionally a layer on top of direct3d that supports more 2d specific functionality as well as excellent text support
