onstart is less commonly used than oncreate

methods,appropriate,activity,first
instead you use other lifecycle methods that are more appropriate such as onstart which will be called both after oncreate when the activity is first created and when the activity is returning to the foreground from having been in the background

handling,place,earlier
in my fragments data handling is taking place starting from oncreate which happens earlier than onstart
