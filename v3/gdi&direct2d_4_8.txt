slower
but my direct2d code is much slower than my gdi code

slower
a direct2d is slower than gdi

others---------------------------------------------------

suspect,direct,new,directwrite,apis
i suspect that they re bypassing gdi and using something more direct like the new directwrite and or direct2d apis

threads,granular,gdi+
threads in direct2d is more granular than in gdi and gdi+ so that the

thing,faster,draw,bitmap
the thing is that gdi is still faster than direct2d if i draw to a bitmap and after it s done i bitblt the result back to the form it paints at 35ms and with the same graphics quality

tried,gdi-compatible,id2d1dcrendertarget+binddc,slower,pure
a i tried gdi-compatible direct2d using id2d1dcrendertarget+binddc but it is much slower than pure gdi

antialiasing,performance,par,faster
disable antialiasing and the performance of direct2d will be on par or faster than gdi

faster,shot,variables
i ve read that direct2d is much faster than gdi so i figured i would give it a shot for dealing with constantly updated variables
