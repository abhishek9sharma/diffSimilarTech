default,larger,necessary,scroll
by default when you scale a qgraphicsscene larger than the qgraphicsview in which it is displayed it will show the necessary scroll bars

pixmap,larger,window,scrollbars,possible
if i set a pixmap to a qgraphicsscene that is larger that the window it will add scrollbars so is it possible to get what is displayed in the qgraphicsview

i have a qgraphicsview nested within a few widgets qframe and then in a qtab and i want to be able to drag-and-drop a qtablewidget which is within the qgraphicsscene onto a totally different widget - another qtablewidget which is much higher up in the window but not a parent
