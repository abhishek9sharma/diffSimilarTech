technology, core, technologies, ---------------------------------------------------

laptop,logical,cores,physical,technologies
however often laptop processors will have more logical cores than physical cores due to hyperthreading or other technologies

chip,logical,technology,core
the rule of thumb is that if a cpu is given more than double the count of actively running threads as it has execution units these are the physical cores on a cpu chip and logical processors like hyperthreading technology that splits one core into two then the os will spend more time scheduling threads and switching between them cache-thrashing than it will spend actually running the threads

older, modern, law, ---------------------------------------------------

law,older,physical
first amdahl s law is older than hyperthreading so the law itself assumes you have physical processors

modern,better,older
more modern processors handle hyperthreading better than older processors

others---------------------------------------------------

large,amounts,memory
you may find that hyperthreading helps more on code that is using large amounts of memory so that the processors is regularly blocked on fetching from memory

number,total,virtual,physical,greater
in computer 1 the eigen3 performance is worse because the number of total processors virtual + physical - Ã¢ due to hyperthreading is greater than the number of physical processors

virtual,cpu,things,multiple,cores,features,higher
vcpu reg are virtual cpu registers that exist on many processors that have things like multiple cores hyperthreading or other features that enable higher layers to believe that there is more than one cpu present when there isn t -- such as today s x86s

instructions,better,thanks,cache,behavior
it might be that latency of various instructions is much better covered by the processors thanks to hyperthreading or cache behavior as sizes differ

logical,core
processors with hyperthreading can have more than one logical core per physical core

first,step,simultaneous,multithreading,poorer,performances,technology
first step would be to investigate why a processors with hyperthreading simultaneous multithreading could lead to poorer performances than a processors without this technology
