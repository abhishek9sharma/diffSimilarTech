fragments,little
an activity that uses fragments is often little more than oncreate calling setcontentview

time,initialization,variables,event,better
so for one time initialization code like setcontentview or initializing variables the oncreate event is a better place

personal,preference,super.oncreate,rest,method,likely
my personal preference is to call setcontentview immediately after super.oncreate so that i know the rest of the oncreate method is less likely to break

minimal,project,nothing,super
i can make this happen with the minimal project where oncreate does nothing more than call super and setcontentview

suer,top,xml
do the following in your oncreate make suer you have setcontentview on the top which sets your xml containing the splash details
