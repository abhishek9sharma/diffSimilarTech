better, faster, ansi, ---------------------------------------------------

ifloop,answer,faster
this is pretty much the ifloop answer but isnull is slightly faster than coalesce

place,faster
you can use isnull also in place of coalesce as isnull is comparatively faster than coalesce

standard,ansi,better,performance
coalesce is the standard ansi way isnull gives slightly better performance although the difference is probably insignificant in most cases

example,better
an example of why coalesce is better than isnull

faster
isnull is faster than coalesce

better,datatypes
isnull is better then coalesce because of how datatypes are handled

better,generic
isnull performs better than the generic coalesce and better than having another and

note,better,application
note that in this case the isnull would do the same as coalesce but looks better for this application in case you add some new language

queries,thet,dynamic,better
in most cases it has reviled indexes that needed to be add and in most cases the indexes improved the queries the most but after thet have been added the isnull and dynamic still perform better than the coalesce

faster,lesser,implementation
isnull will be faster i think because it has lesser function code implementation for itself making it faster than coalesce

input,faster
isnull can only have one input however it s been shown to be slightly faster than coalesce

faster
isnull is marginally faster than coalesce

better,results
i would see if i got better results with isnull instead of coalesce

answers,trick,better
but depending on the answers to those questions i m guessing that coalesce might do the trick for you better than isnull

multiple,theory,better
edit based on the tests done by multiple people and by theory isnull seems to be a better option over coalesce

ansi,standard,sql,server,favor,better,effort
note that i much much much prefer the ansi standard coalesce but sql server has done us the favor of documenting why isnull is better effort that imho could have been spent fixing the problem

sql,server,better,latter,ansi
on the subject of performance on sql server isnull often performs better than coalesce but the latter is ansi compliant if that is important to you

performance,field,constant,better
is the performance of coalesce field constant better than isnull

better
you will find that coalesce works better than isnull here

circumstances,faster
in some circumstances isnull is faster than case or coalesce

efficient, query, plans, ---------------------------------------------------

query,plans,efficient
to prefer isnull over coalesce when given the choice is that isnull tends to produce query plans that are more efficient than coalesce

statement,version,efficient
i saw a coalesce statement version but isnull is more efficient

alternative, standard, ---------------------------------------------------

standard,alternative
coalesce is the more standard alternative of isnull

standard
you could also use isnull but coalesce is more standard

values, first, null, ---------------------------------------------------

null,value,quicker
i understand the difference between these functions but my question is when checking for a single null value would isnull be any quicker than using coalesce

values,first,null,portable,ivnl
coalesce will go through the listed values and choose the first one that isn t null it s more portable code than isnull or ivnl etc

first,non-null,set,values,parameters
i tend to use coalesce only when i need to get the first non-null value from a set of 3 or more values as isnull only supports two parameters

values,columns,column1,column2
you can also use isnull but coalesce allow more that two values you can use it for three or more columns like coalesce column1 column2 column3

others---------------------------------------------------

function,kind,equivalent,arguments,standard
the function isnull is kind of equivalent but coalesce allows more arguments and is standard sql.

portable
- coalesce should be more portable than isnull

cross-compatible,mssql,oracle
coalesce is more cross-compatible than isnull or nvl it works on mssql oracle mysql derby et al.

correct,over...,performance,microscope
coalesce is more correct of course you could just embed isnull over and over and over... but put that under a performance microscope and coalesce may just win

costly,research
i ve been told that coalesce is less costly than isnull but research doesn t indicate that

better,case..when,input,values,expression,multiple
using coalesce is better option than isnull or case..when for this problem since the input values for the coalesce expression can be evaluated multiple times

general,form,part,sql
you can also use coalesce which is the more general form of isnull and is actually part of the sql standard

anyone,curious,discussion,answer,kanav,expensive
for anyone curious about the coalesce vs isnull discussion and why i changed my answer to use isnull kanav rightly pointed out that coalesce is more expensive

implicit,data,type,conversions,simpler,rules
coalesce case can add implicit data type conversions whereas isnull has simpler rules

smart,enough,equivalent,sarg,bent,function,better,part,multiple,values,confusing,name,microsoft
sql server is probably smart enough to translate isnull into the equivalent sarg expression but if you are bent on using a function then coalesce is a better choice because it is part of the sql standard allows for multiple values instead of just two with isnull and avoids using quite possibly the most confusing function name microsoft ever devised in isnull

levels,stement
in this case i would use coalesce which provides more levels than isnull rather than the case stement
