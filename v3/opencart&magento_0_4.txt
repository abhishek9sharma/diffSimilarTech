larger,extensions
magento is way ahead and has larger extensions than opencart

better,good,developer,easier
magento is much better if you can find a good magento developer to customize it for you but opencart is easier to use

first,site,things,bit,different,new,harder,thing
i m working on my first magento site and things are a little bit different than for example opencart but just trying to learn new things i decided to go with magento and try harder however there s one thing that i git stuck and is this i m calling my shopping cart elements using this

cscart,features,time,cost,setup,run
i d have to say i d personally go for either prestashop or cscart as they do have a lot more features than opencart and at the same time also don t cost anywhere near magento to setup and run
