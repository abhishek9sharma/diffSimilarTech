experiment,material,real,slower,plain
i ve only done one experiment with angular material myself and i wasn t experiencing any real performance issues at the time but i did read some people writing about it being slower than plain ionic

legacy,promise,standard,method,higher,version
i think your code has no problem except that angular has deprecated legacy promise methods success and error of http after version 1.4.4 you should use standard then method instead if your ionic depends on higher angular version

docs,clear,user-friendly,intimidating
the docs for ionic 2 are clear user-friendly and much less intimidating than angular 2 docs
