slower, gpu, equivalent, ---------------------------------------------------

faster,slower,training
is keras faster slower than tensorflow during training

gpu,memory,equivalent,model,training
is keras consumes more gpu memory than equivalent tensorflow model training

methodology,training,optimizers,faster
more than this methodology i would suggest to you to do the training directly in keras as it claimed that keras optimizers are 5-10 times faster than tensorflow s optimizers

others---------------------------------------------------

easier
i suggest you to use keras i find it easier to use than tensorflow

simpler,quicker,models,performance,cost,engine
keras provides a simpler quicker way to build and train models in tensorflow at no performance cost since the models are still being run by the same tensorflow engine

native,backend,hours,testing,parameters,figure,better
i created the exact same network with native and backend tensorflow but after many hours of testing using number of different parameters still couldn t figure out why keras outperforms the native tensorflow and produces better slightly but better results

similar,spirit,high-level,api,top,theano,cntk,main
it is similar in spirit to keras which is built as a high-level api on top of theano tensorflow cntk although the main difference is that lasagne implements only one backend allowing it to integrate more deeply with theano features
