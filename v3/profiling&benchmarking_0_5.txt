execution,time,higher
the issue is that the execution time of a benchmarking is much higher about 3 times in case i do not invoke the profiling along with it than the case when the benchmarking is executing with the profiling

svick,better,program,hot,spots,concrete
as svick said it s no better way than profiling your program identifying hot spots and optimizing them using concrete benchmarking

appropriate,tricky
using a profiling is often more appropriate than benchmarking but it seems to be even more tricky

system,minitest,performance
minitest has much more than most people know for example minitest spec has bdd matchers akin to rspec minitest mock is a mocking system and minitest benchmarking is for performance profiling

query,need
to get a more reliable timing of the query you d need to use profiling or some other way of benchmarking that works more directly with the query
