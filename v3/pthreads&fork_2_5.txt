processes, better, clone, ---------------------------------------------------

clone,better
but when is fork and clone better than pthreads

processes,clone,better
there is a nice comparison of threads and processes here when is clone and fork better than pthreads

others---------------------------------------------------

separate,namespace,non-zts,extensions,model
multithreading is faster takes up less resources there is no separate namespace for it and you can run them 4 times more than the fork but multithreading requires build php with non-zts some extensions do not work with non-zts and requires something you would understand pthreads model

discussions,extreme,processes,provision,extensive,independence
the features stemming from those discussions permit less extreme fork than processes which is symmetrically like the provision of more extensive independence between pthreads

old,process,new,state
third since the question is tagged multithreading if the old process is running more than one pthreads then the new process inherits all the mutexes conditions etc of the old process in the state they were in when fork was called
