specific, functions, ---------------------------------------------------

specific
ienumerable is less specific than ilist

specific,functions
ienumerable is less specific than an ilist that is ilist has functions that ienumerable does not

functionality, nhibernate, interface, ---------------------------------------------------

thing,nhibernate,functionality
another thing that bothers me is why in nhibernate always it is being used ilist and not ienumerable which has less functionality

tolist,interface,functionality
you need to use tolist to convert it from ienumerable because the ilist interface supports more functionality than the ienumerable interface

better, good, iqueryable, ---------------------------------------------------

icollection,better,large
compared to ienumerable and icollection ilist performs much better for large or dynamic lists because it provides an indexer allowing us quick random access

iqueryable,better,generic,good
generally ienumerable and iqueryable are even better than ilist as they re more generic unless you want to limit this with good reason of course

abstract, possible, collections, ---------------------------------------------------

abstract,possible
ienumerable is more abstract and is generally preferred to list or ilist if possible

method,collections,abstract
another suggestion change you to because you can keep an extension method for more collections because the ienumerable is more abstract than ilist

others---------------------------------------------------

work,specialized
the reason why this doesn t work specifically is because ilist is more specialized than ienumerable

stronger,guarantees
ilist is stronger in that it makes more guarantees than ienumerable

specific
an ienumerable is less specific than an ilist

methods,base,larger,selection
basically the methods will range from a base of ienumerable all the way up to ilist which has a larger selection available

specific,implements,.count,delete,use
ienumerable is less specific than ilist ilist implements ienumerable so unless you want something specific from ilist such as .count as you suggest or perhaps add delete etc i d use ienumerable

able
thus ilist is more than ienumerable and you won t be able to get away with it

lighter,situations,approach
yes i understand that ienumerable is much more lighter rather than ilist but anyway there is a lot situations where we need to have ilist instead of ienumerable and in this approach we need to cast ienumerable to ilist isn t it
