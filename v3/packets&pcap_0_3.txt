fewer,cnt,implementation
note the bit that says so fewer than cnt packets may be processed - it s up the the pcap implementation what it does

leverage,last,lower,value,sides,time,line,mergepcap
this should give you a little bit of leverage however the last few packets may get lost lower the value in the if statement to mitigate this. suggest using it on both sides at the same time so each pcap should line up later on you can use mergepcap as mike suggests to if you like

lengths,eapol,wireshark,longer
i am working with pcap in c and comparing the lengths of eapol handshakes with those get in wireshark and the eapol packets captured with pcap are longer
