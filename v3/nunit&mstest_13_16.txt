better, support, good, ---------------------------------------------------

unit,testing,better,abilities
he concludes that nunit wins for unit testing but mstest has much better abilities for integration based testing and team testing with team system

better,support,parameterized,tests
nunit has better support for parameterized tests than mstest

example,better,experiences
example with nunit i have better experiences with nunit than with mstest

various,better,idea,good
various people told me to go with nunit since it s better than mstest apparently i have no idea and it also has very good support in resharper which i m using

better,support,popular
although several ci tools such as teamcity have better support for nunit probably would change as mstest becomes more popular

mbunit, features, bunch, ---------------------------------------------------

test,difficult,frameworks,mbunit,etc.
i ve read time and time again that tdd test first is more difficult with mstest than it is with other testing frameworks such as nunit mbunit etc.

widespread,mbunit,features,manpower
nunit is more widespread mbunit has the most features but mstest has more manpower behind it

bunch,features,longer,mature
mstest is missing a bunch of features that nunit has and nunit has been around longer is more mature

slower, faster, ---------------------------------------------------

faster
nunit is faster as compared to mstest

slower
from my experience mstest is much slower than nunit

speeds, testdriven.net, instrumentation, ---------------------------------------------------

test,speeds,faster
nonetheless i tried to compare the sum of all test speeds and in some cases nunit is faster and in other cases mstest is faster

testdriven.net,instrumentation,faster
the best testdriven.net disables all instrumentation that mstest does so it makes mstest blazing fast - much faster than nunit for example

others---------------------------------------------------

sriwantha,simpler,framework
sriwantha mstest is a simpler framework than nunit

edition,inbuilt,better,cruise,control
if you have a full version of visual studio 2008 rather than the express edition it integrates the inbuilt mstest much better than nunit does and cruise control also supports mstest

methods
for example nunit offers more assert methods than mstest

suspect,faster,loading,delays
thus i suspect when people say that nunit is much faster than mstest it is because of the loading and updating delays but the actual test execution time appears to be very similar
