note,better,specific,available
note better than just runtimeexception would be to use a more specific unchecked-exception if one is available

common,necessary
unchecked-exception which extend runtimeexception are more common and don t have the necessary verbose syntax

new,simpler,throwables.propagate,wrapping,exception
using throw new runtimeexception e is simpler to comprehend than throwables.propagate in the scenario where you want to throw an unchecked-exception wrapping a checked exception

subclasses,exception
unchecked-exception that are expected more or less same as above some people like to throw subclasses of runtimeexception instead of exception
