broken,good
notepad++ which is often recommended are even more broken than sublimetext 2 which i find to be pretty good actually

customizable,great,options
i prefer sublimetext because it s a little more customizable than notepad++ but they re both great options and lighter than dreamweaver

better
i prefer sublimetext 2 but notepad++ or scite might suit you better
