efficient,filechannel
you have to open an inputstream and an outputstream optionally get their more efficient filechannel s and use a buffer to transfer bytes

datainput,objectoutput,easier,opinion
then instead of using datainput outputstream you should use an objectoutput inputstream makes it easier in my opinion

contents,file,buffer,for-loop,data,bytes,available
when i want to write the full contents of a file into an outputstream i usually allocate a buffer as a then make a for-loop to read data from the file s inputstream into the buffer and write the buffer contents into the outputstream until the inputstream has no more bytes available

bytes,modification,doc
what i did not expect is that outputstream is much less bytes than inputstream although i have yet to make any modification on doc
