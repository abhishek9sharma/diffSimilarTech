worst,quadratic
heapsort can sort in-place and doesn t have the worst case quadratic behavior but on average is slower than quicksort in most cases

average,slower,standard,quicksort
but heapsort is assumed to be on average somewhat slower than standard in-place quicksort

faster,insert,sort,reversal
dr your heapsort is not faster because it isn t actually a heapsort it s a backwards insert sort followed by an in-place ordering reversal
