larger, program, handset, ---------------------------------------------------

smaller
the screens is much smaller so you can not present your app the same way as you can on a tablet

larger
not all tablet will have a larger screens after all

wider
however i also need to support tablet which have wider screens

program,bigger,right
but tablet program screens will be bigger right

mobile,smaller
correct me if im wrong but i think the apk for mobile can be used to install the app in tablet.your problem would be in the ui coz mobile has smaller screens than tablet

larger,handset
because a tablet s screens is much larger than that of a handset there s more room to combine and interchange ui components

greater,resolutions,smartphones
i beleive tablet have greater screens resolutions than smartphones

larger,phone
the tablet s screens must be larger than the phone s screens

larger
because a tablet s screens is much larger than that of a

size,bigger
on tablet the screens size is much bigger and there is enough space for most of the action items that s why your menu is placed on top

res, reasonable, ones, ---------------------------------------------------

different,ones,size,reasonable,bigger,margins,mix,res
having different ones based upon screens size is reasonable bigger margins on tablet though the mix then would be something like res values dimens.xml and res values-sw720dp values.xml

aware,size,categories,documentation,xlarge,larger,large
just be aware that screens size categories like xlarge for example aren t tied to a hard number like 10 inches. instead official documentation uses terms like an xlarge screens is defined as a screens that is significantly larger than a large screens such as a tablet or something larger ...

width, smaller, desktop, ---------------------------------------------------

larger,phone,new
to ensure all tablet excluding any larger screens phone will use the new layout how should i name my layout folder

smaller,width,640px,range,960px
like most screens being no smaller than 320px width most mobile sizes in the 320Ã¢ 640px range tablet usually around 960px

text,left,smaller,phone
inside the container i have a panel with the text set to left but when the screens gets smaller then a tablet to something like a phone i want the text in the panel to center

youll,dimensions,mobile,hard,bigger,smartphone.
youll want to choose which screens dimensions you consider as mobile might be hard as some tablet are barely bigger than some smartphone.

desktop,version,fine,smaller,smartphone
the desktop tablet version is working fine its when the screens gets smaller and the smartphone version loads the image doesn t work as it should

splitactionbar,phones,size,smaller,space,bottom
splitactionbar works only on phones because the screens size is much smaller than tablet and it takes space at the bottom for extra space for your action items

number,giant,smaller,small,laptops
however the number of people using these giant tablet is much smaller than the number of people with small screens laptops

layout,bigger,240dpi
i m trying use a grid layout but my problem is the layout showing bigger than my screens on the 240dpi tablet 1 5 times bigger

phone,width,viewport
on a tablet or phone which may have less than 750px screens width it will go off the viewport

desktop,devices,phones,width,page
i have been working on this page that works fine in desktop devices and tablet but not on phones because the width of the page is more than the screens width i need to make this width responsive to have the page with height-only scroll

wider,responsive,smaller,size
when viewed on a screens wider than a tablet to be responsive according to the smaller screens size like this

landscape,view,larger,certain
if the app is running on a tablet or in a landscape view where the screens is larger than certain width i d like the listviews to have the data-inset property set to true and be rendered with rounded corners and borders

size,smaller,mobile,example
for example when the screens size becomes smaller to a tablet or mobile you could do this as an example

layout,phone,large,larger
it s hard to explain but just imagine that i move this layout to 300px x then on the phone it works because the screens isn t that large but on tablet it will probably not work because the screens is larger

links,mobile,size,bigger,desktop
my aim is to use a bootstrap 3 dropdown to display links at mobile screens size and use a list to display the same links when the screens is bigger desktop and tablet size

smartphones,smaller,higher,resolutions,bigger
if i try to distinguish based on resolutions it wouldn t work right since some high end smartphones have smaller screens but higher screens resolutions while some tablet have bigger screens but smaller resolutions

resolutions,mdpi,larger,dpi,rating
the reason those two really high resolutions exist in mdpi is because they are only used on tablet which have a larger screens size...so the dpi rating works out to still be in the midrange

larger,devices,width
another layout for larger devices like tablet where the screens width is larger than your image

apps,layout,mode,large,bigger
also a tablet might be more suited since it runs apps in tablet layout mode versus a phone layout with everything being too large on a bigger screens

width,smaller,version,mobile
this will only be added if the screens width is smaller than 480px else the tablet version would show the mobile version

large,devices,larger,width,height
it is quite possible that those large devices tablet have much larger screens width and height than a typical phone

properties,mobile,wider,desktop,css
you could make your css mobile-first meaning that all properties are optimized for mobile then as the screens gets wider you apply tablet and desktop optimized css for elements

mode,phone,smaller,screen_is_narrow,landscape,wider
in portrait mode your phone screens is smaller than that so screen_is_narrow is true whereas in landscape mode and on tablet it is wider and thus screen_is_narrow becomes false

platforms,larger,affix,disabled
in mobile platforms except larger screens as on tablet the affix would be disabled entirely and the page would only rely on the responsiveness of the grid

issue,size,bigger,videoview
on a tablet i don t have this issue because the screens size is bigger and i make videoview always on screens

height,width,dpi,low
this way you get if the screens height or width is greater than 960px and the dpi is low probably you re on a tablet

title,tabs,smaller,iphone
what i would like to do is use css media queries to have the title be above the tabs when the screens gets smaller or on a tablet or iphone

screensizes,wide,smaller,smartphone,open
twitter desktop accomodates screensizes from around 1048px wide when you are on a screens that is smaller then that you are probably on a tablet or smartphone and if you open twitter from a browser on your phone you are instantly redirected to and prompted to download the twitter app

room, available, space, ---------------------------------------------------

fragments,room,activity
if my app runs on tablet i put more fragments on the screens as there s room for this and i got just one activity in which i replace fragments when needed

space,available,room,developers
it simply comes down to the space available a tablet gives more room to developers thus allowing developers to put more on one screens

fonts,space,available
you will also notice that the fonts are not scaling as the 7 tablet simply has more screens space available vs the 4 phone

pixels, resolution, higher, ---------------------------------------------------

screenshot,big,resolution,higher
a bitmap of a screenshot can get really big on a tablet since the screens resolution is likely higher

lower,density,pixels
this is because that tablet often has a lower density of screens pixels

higher,resolution,phone,pixels,dots,dpi
i know that obviously a tablet has a higher screens resolution than a phone because it has more pixels dots on the screens from what ive been reading tablet also have a higher dpi dots per inch than phones as well

higher,resolution,pixels,right
the tablet had a higher resolution 1920 x 1080 pixels - found by checking the screens resolution through a right click on the desktop than the machine i had initially run the program on 1366 x 768 pixels

smartphones,higher,dpi
incidentally many smartphones and tablet do have higher dpi screens

resolution,higher,i.e,col-md
screens resolution i.e higher than tablet i.e col-md and col-lg in bootstrap language should only cover 11 grid with offset of 1

use, diagonal, criteria, ---------------------------------------------------

xlarge,larger,large,special,use,system
an xlarge screens is defined as a screens that is significantly larger than a large screens such as a tablet or something larger and may require special care on the application s part to make good use of it though it may rely on resizing by the system to fill the screens

device,mobile,use,criteria,diagonal,greater,iches
to determine device is tablet or mobile i use criteria if device s screens diagonal is greater than 7 iches the device is tablet

resolution, phones, higher, ---------------------------------------------------

size,devices,note,huge,phones,higher,resolution,dpi
i can t use screens size because of devices like galaxy note with huge screens and some phones have higher resolution than some tablet same with dpi i think

grid,width,resolution,population,media,queries,size,smaller,phones
basically my layout has 1200px grid width but i figured that there will be a problem with 1024px screens resolution 20 of the population bla bla so i created media queries when the screens size is smaller than 1199px the grid to change its width to 960px and so on for tablet phones etc..

contrast,nexus,higher,actual,resolution,ipad,page,smaller,size
by contrast a nexus 7 tablet has higher actual screens resolution than an ipad mini but it reports to your web page a smaller screens size

pop-up, computer, website, ---------------------------------------------------

ipad,bigger,phone,image,pop-up,visible
since the screens of an ipad or other tablet is bigger than a phone s display and that would leave me with a bunch of open space i was wondering if there is something in codename one to have an image pop-up on a tablet but that it is not visible on a phone s display

computer,full,mode,smaller,phone,size,divs
this only happens when the window is on a computer in full screens mode but when the screens is made smaller to a phone tablet size the divs function how they should

website,page,size,logo,perfect,ratio,bigger
i ve come across this website and when you scale the page down to tablet size the logo which is ethan marcotte is in perfect ratio when the screens size gets bigger and smaller

different, data, sizes, ---------------------------------------------------

layouts,different,sizes,possibility,data,phone
you do not have to provide different layouts for different screens sizes however the possibility of say a tablet displaying more data over a phone is there - so you may want to give the user more options or show the navigation constantly

desktops,full,detailed,data,experience,mobile,different
desktops when in full screens have a more detailed data entry experience whereas mobile tablet have a different experience because of device real estate is smaller

run,troubles,multiple,sizes,different
in the long run you ll have less troubles with supporting tablet multiple screens sizes and you can easily re-use them in different contexts

others---------------------------------------------------

issue,phone,height,landscape,mode,pc
the issue is that the phone screens height in landscape mode is likely much less than a tablet or pc

worse,new,high,dpi,100px,smaller,mid,spec
using px as a measurement would actually be worse - as new tablet have high dpi screens meaning 100px is going to be visually smaller on a tablet than it would on a mid spec phone

location,pc,accurate,corresponding,operation,phone
is there a reason why getting a location from a pc screens could be more accurate than the corresponding operation on a tablet or phone

small,tableth,centimeter,pone
they are for example too big in a phone and too small in a tableth because the screens of tablet has more centimeter than the pone screens

settings,smaller,regular,phone,device,small,compatibility,zoom
i know that when it does the whole configuration settings are representing a much smaller screens than the tablet s screens but how can i tell if this is a regular phone device with a small screens or a tablet running compatibility zoom mode

display,none,width,larger,size,time
in my actual code i ve set the display to none if the screens width is larger than tablet size because that s the only time i feel like i need the button

size,android,qvga
there is more than one screens size in android and what fits on a qvga 2.8 screens and what fits on a 10 tablet will not be the same

space
tablet have more screens space

practice,bigger,wide
in practice this would be a tablet sized screens bigger than 320px wide when it is in portrait

new,big,bigger
suppose you were to choose a new tablet and you wanted it to have 1 a big screens and 2 a screens that is bigger than 20cm

content,longer,card
the content is longer than the screens of my tablet so i need to scroll vertically on a card

phones,devices,sizes,inch.how,visible,play,store
i would like to make my app available only on phones i.e devices whose screens sizes are less than 5.5 inch.how do i limit my app from being visible on tablet on play store

things,smaller,stuff
a lower dpi makes things smaller and allows this tablet to show more stuff on the screens at once

larger,standard,detachable,keyboards,space,browsers,users,sites
in fact when a tablet has a larger than standard screens size the tablet with detachable keyboards available these days mobile versions of the site can look over-optimised for space which is the reason why browsers allow tablet users to opt to display sites in desktop mode

client,twebbrowser,a4,aspect
it s like the measurements aren t the same and even if i use align client the twebbrowser won t fill the screens of the 7 tablet which is more or less the a4 aspect ratio

600dp,larger,copy,advantage,real,estate,located,bin,width,qualifier
any devices 600dp and larger tablet have a larger copy of the image to take advantage of the larger screens real estate while all other phones use a smaller copy located in the bin with no screens width qualifier

local,phablets,mobile,large,density
the first time i run this on a device i realized that i was on a wrong track for some of the local phablets tablet mobile that have large screens has less screens density

bigger,child,views
this tablet has a bigger screens yet is still showing only 2 child views in the row

density,smaller,android,mdpi,folder,bigger,ones
owing to the fact that the screens density on the tablet is smaller android therefore uses the images in the mdpi folder for the tablet and the slightly bigger ones in the hdpi folder for the phone

space,phone
a tablet offers more screens space than a phone

example,android,stock,player,feature,full
as an example my android tablet s stock video player app has a feature that allows it to be less than full screens

col-md-4,class,medium,size,ipad,responsiveness
here in your example col-md-4 class is been used that means if you will shrink your screens more than medium screens size ipad or tablet it will starts responsiveness

mean,default,wider,tall.
tablet mean that the default is that the screens is wider than it is tall.

avds,bigger,slower,unusable,machine
you will see that mostly the avds with the bigger screens are way slower tablet are unusable on my machine hvga is almost like a real device

width,higher,landscape,layout,applicable,mode,phones
if the width of the screens is higher than 768px use the landscape layout split the screens into 2 applicable in landscape mode for phones and tablet
