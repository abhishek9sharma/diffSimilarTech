steeper,learning,curve
erlang has a steeper learning curve compared to elixir

microservices,polyglotism,benefits,pure,collaborative,applications,optimal
i mean i could just write microservices with elixir and use them as if they were written in any other language polyglotism is one of the benefits of microservices anyway but then i m not getting the full benefits of using the otp platform i guess that pure collaborative erlang applications are way more optimal that using intermediate queues to communicate between microservices written in different or not languages

mechanisms,verbose,function,definitions
i agree some mechanisms in elixir are slightly more verbose than erlang function definitions being my personal pet peeve and vice-versa
