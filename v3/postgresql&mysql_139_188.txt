large, faster, big, ---------------------------------------------------

large,datasets,fulltext,10-100x,faster,xapian,integrated
i did some benchmarking 3 years ago may be stale... which showed that on large datasets basically postgresql fulltext is 10-100x faster than mysql and xapian 10-100x faster than postgresql but not integrated

fewer,experienced,big,databases,reputation
and postgresql has fewer experienced administrators than the big databases and mysql which i believe contributes to the reputation

recent,tests,faster,table,feature,important
some recent tests we did showed that postgresql does perform faster than mysql and we believe the table partitioning feature in postgresql will be very important with a table in our database we foresee to grow into 100 million rows and more in production

application,models,database,performance,tables,big,faster
i ve built a rails application using mysql and now would like to move some models to a postgresql database for performance reasons the tables are quite big and postgresql is faster

sql,reccommend,large,databases,frequent,better
if you want to use sql i strongly reccommend postgresql it seems to deal with large databases and frequent writes a lot better than mysql

better, data, support, ---------------------------------------------------

local,installs,better,sqlite
local installs of postgresql or even mysql might be a better choice than sqlite for what you re doing

scales,better
honestly though postgresql scales much better than mysql

better,things,uses
now i m not sure if i d say postgresql is generally better than mysql -- there are certainly things that mysql does much better and so it certainly has its uses -- but these are a few things i absolutely love about it

better,application,familiar,support,object-oriented
i m currently considering which is a better choice for my php application - mysql which i m more familiar with or postgresql which has less php support no object-oriented wrapper but seems tried and tested

research,better,support,schemas
the only reason i was considering postgresql was that some research suggested postgresql has much better support for changing schemas along the way than mysql

relational,dbs,better,data
mysql and other relational dbs such as postgresql are better data stores than mongodb for relational data

words,better,worse,unicode
in other words is mysql better or worse than postgresql to handle unicode etc

time,needs,better
also you might take the time to compare postgresql and see if there is something about it that meets your needs as well or better than mysql

indexes,better
i really like postgresql s indexes which are far better than mysql s

better,data,warehousing
postgresql is much better suited for data warehousing compared to mysql

bad,longterm,good,better,satisfied
anyways mysql is bad and on longterm especially if you are enough good for java i suggest you to use some better db with postgresql you were really satisfied i think

better,capabilities,json,versions
i found that postgresql 9.3 has better capabilities for json than the mysql versions i am using

better
an efficiently configured mysql is better than a badly configured postgresql and vice-versa

threads,default,best,better,performance-wise
but if you do a lot of heavy updates to a table as often as other threads have to read then the default locking in mysql is not the best and postgresql can be a better choice performance-wise

better,bigger,projects
some say mysql is much better for bigger projects while others think just go with postgresql

better
then postgresql is much better than mysql

proven,huge,data
either postgresql more proven than mysql for such huge data

wiki,better
and a wiki for why postgresql is better than mysql

p.s,better,features,json,data,mariadb
p.s postgresql have better features to store json data compared to mysql or mariadb

famous,serious,data,critical
while mysql is more famous for serious enterprise-quality database where preserving your data is critical i recommend postgresql

recursive,queries,data,easier,better,performance
postgresql supports recursive queries in the form of recursive common table expressions which make querying heirarchical data easier than in mysql and also give better performance

relational,databases
if you are looking for location based queries in relational databases postgresql is more matured compared to mysql

database,suitable,complex
for a database i generally use mysql though postgresql might be more suitable if you do lots of really complex queries

database,better
and any python orm will make it easier to switch out your database if you find something better than mysql like postgresql

nested,comments,hierarchical,better
i d also recommend postgresql over mysql if you are going to have nested comments as postgresql does hierarchical querying better than mysql

scalable,database,better
i would need a scalable database so probably postgresql would be better than mysql

reputation,things,better,good,similar,performance
given postgresql s reputation for doing things better than mysql or at least as good as i daresay that postgresql would demonstrate similar performance if properly used

operations,better
generally speaking i find postgresql lends itself to 24 7 operations better than mysql

better,query,likely
in your case postgresql may be a better option than mysql because your query is going to likely be against secondary indexes

better,respect
postgresql is way better than mysql in nearly every respect

databases,slew,problems,better
i just recently switched databases to postgresql which has given me a slew of problems although i must admit i like it a lot better than mysql

better,tables,date
is postgresql a better option than mysql for partitioning tables by date

better,fit
i start off with something like mysql and then later on i might decide that postgresql makes a better fit - and if i have done everything the propel way switching to the new engine is trivial - rebuild and go

group,leader,better
the other question is that what i am hearing from our group leader is that postgresql is better than mysql when working with coordinates

sql,features,efficient,data
however i find postgresql to support more sql features than mysql and be more efficient when handling more data

better,ways
postgresql is better than mysql in many ways

worse,multiple,indexes,dropping.
worse with mysql if you drop multiple indexes on the same table it will re-copy the table once for each index you re removing instead of being smart and re-copying the data once without all the indexes you re dropping. is something like this happening with postgresql

projects,better
i have used both and even migrated projects from mysql to postgresql and in my experience postgresql was the better choice

concurrent,use,better
with correct locking for safety reasons and heavy concurrent use postgresql performed better than mysql

good,job,client,mechanism,better
mysql can do a good job with a small number of clients at higher client counts the locking mechanism in postgresql might do a better job

licence,firebird,better
i don t like mysql licence firebird and postgresql are better

queries,mapping,databases,schemas,easier
no cross-database queries if you need something like that mapping mysql databases to postgresql schemas is probably easier

better,free
you may find postgresql to be a better free choice than mysql but you ll have to evaluate this yourself 1

workloads,better
there are workloads where postgresql is better and there are workloads where mysql is better

better,resolution
also if you open to moving away from mysql i ve found that postgresql has much better resolution of deadlocks

right,better,support,features,good,superior
you re right postgresql has much better support for sql and other advanced features so there s a very good case for why postgresql is superior to mysql

better,speed
postgresql seem to better than mysql in terms of speed

easier
mysql is easier than postgresql but it doesn t really matter either way

faster
postgresql is faster than mysql s innodb

databases,better,contrast
however i don t know whether databases in my case mysql maybe postgresql would be better at handling compressing option a in contrast to option b

fyi,scales,better,multi-processor,requests
fyi postgresql scales better than mysql on multi-processor overlapping requests from a review i was reading a few months back sorry no link

harder
does this affect postgresql harder than mysql

better,performance,former,partisan
postgresql gets much better performance and this is coming from a former mysql partisan

group,leader,better
what i am hearing from our group leader is that postgresql is better than mysql when working with coordinates

data,capabilities,better
if you need spatial data capabilities postgis with postgresql is better than mysql

better,imo,database,django
postgresql is also a lot better imo than mysql and is the recommended database to use with django according to a lot of the people close to django

better,unicode
in my cases postgresql was better than mysql mysql do not completely support unicode

anyone,issues,i18n,support,better,application
does anyone know issues with mysql s i18n support and if postgresql would be better placed for building an application with indic language support kannada telugu tamil etc using utf-8 encoding

better,purpose
is postgresql better than mysql for such purpose

better,hierarchical,data,ready
i was told that postgresql is a better choice than mysql for displaying hierarchical data so i installed postgresql and i m ready to go

better,support,storage,engine
postgresql has better support but the support by mysql depends on the used storage engine

better,security,feature,rich.
some people were saying that postgresql is better for security purposes whereas mysql is becoming more feature rich.

popular, shame, web, ---------------------------------------------------

popular,instagram
though mysql is more popular than postgresql but instagram is using postgresql maybe due to these reasons

shame,popular,feature,out-of-the-box
it s a shame postgresql isn t more popular than mysql since it supports exactly this feature out-of-the-box you d only have to share one sequence object between tables.

popular,serious,web
while postgresql is less popular than mysql most of the serious web hosting supports it

powerful, robust, mature, ---------------------------------------------------

mature,robust
i feel postgresql is much more mature and robust than mysql

little,bit,mature
postgresql will always be a little bit more mature than mysql

comprehensive,gis,extension,dumb,flapjack
postgresql has a more comprehensive gis extension . mysql s is as dumb as a flapjack in flatland

shared,providers,powerful
mysql is probably more often offered by shared hosting providers postgresql is probably a little more powerful

restrictive
postgresql is a bit more restrictive than mysql

stable
the mysql one was more stable than the postgresql one

robust,free
there is also postgresql its a bit more robust than mysql and is free just the same

free,oracle,powerful
i cannot propose any db not knowing your specific needs but if you want to use a free software which excludes oracle and you re not already experienced with mysql you should try postgresql which is more powerful than mysql

powerful,scalable,silly,limitations
postgresql is far more powerful and scalable and doesn t have mysql s silly limitations and gotchas

robust,crash,situations
i hear postgresql is more robust and doesn t crash like mysql does in these situations

stricter, error, type, ---------------------------------------------------

stricter,conversions,error,string
postgresql is stricter about conversions than mysql is and generally will throw an error rather than try to convert a string to an integer if it doesn t look like one

error,implementation,sql
i totally understand the error and assume that the mysql implementation is less sql conform than the postgresql implementation

implicit,type,conversions,strict
mysql does a lot of implicit type conversions postgresql is rather more strict and requires you to say exactly what you mean

wrong,fields,aggregation,function,stricter,sql,site_id,query
but in mysql it is ok and in postgresql it is wrong and ask for the other fields besides site_id either in a group by clause or in a aggregation function i know that postgresql is stricter on sql than mysql so i must select the site_id in the query object of msg_published but in pure sqlalchemy i can do like this

stricter,sql,standard
postgresql is stricter to the sql standard than mysql is

pkey,lookups,complex,use
in general mysql is optimized for pkey lookups and postgresql is more generally optimized for complex use cases

resistant,sql,injection
the question is is mysql somehow more resistant than postgresql to sql injection attack under the perl dbi and why might this be the case

strict,type,conversion
postgresql is a little more strict than mysql about type conversion and does not let you implicitly cast convert between numbers and strings

aware,interpretation,sql,standard,stricter,type,query
i am aware that postgresql interpretation of the sql standard is stricter than mysql and that consequently this type of query won t work...and have read a number of posts on stackoverflow and elsewhere on the subject - but none of them seem to be the definitive answer on this subject

permissive,non-standard,use,distinct,error
mysql is more permissive and allows the non-standard use of distinct but postgresql throws an error

familiar, compliant, table, ---------------------------------------------------

compliant
postgresql is more sql compliant than mysql

familiar
i am more familiar with postgresql than mysql

familiar
i am less familiar with postgresql than mysql but

familiar,syntax
my problem is i m more familiar with mysql and could probably figure this out but this is postgresql and i am still getting tripped up on syntax

looks,compliant
looks like postgresql is a little more compliant than mysql so try this instead

familiar,lastval
i only mention this because a lot of people are more familiar with mysql than postgresql so linking lastval to something familiar might clarify things

databases,index,table,situations
while other databases like mysql can use only one index per table in most situations postgresql can use more than one

flexible,indexing,table,approaches
not only does postgresql have a far more flexible indexing than mysql but the table approaches are very different also meaning the appropriate indexing strategies are as different as the tactics are

ancedotal,servers,troublesome,table
this is ancedotal but the postgresql servers i ve managed have always been much less troublesome than mysql which likes to randomly crash once in a while occasionally corrupting a table on the way down

compliant,comfortable
postgresql is more compliant but if you re comfortable with mysql and you re using an orm you should probably use that

familiar,databases,sub-queries
while i am more familiar with mysql than with postgresql i believe it is true for both databases that sub-queries have a negative impact on performance relative to joins

slower, faster, optimizer, ---------------------------------------------------

mariadb,worse
mysql mariadb is slightly worse than postgresql

faster,matter
i ve tried switching from mysql to postgresql and whilst postgresql was fractionally faster it was a matter of 2-3

select,count,slower
unfortunately in postgresql select count is often slower than mysql to which it often get s compared to

file,faster,mariadb
is file based caching faster than the mysql mariadb postgresql

simple,queries,slower,richer,planner
for these ultra simple queries postgresql can be slower than mysql - postgresql has richer planner that works better on more complex queries but on trivial queries is slower

experiance,faster,operations
in my experiance with the two postgresql has shown to be faster on most write operations while mysql is slightly faster on the reads

slower,fine,tuning
in most regards postgresql is slower than mysql especially when it comes to fine tuning in the end

performance,test,slower
i did a simple performance test and i noticed postgresql is slower than mysql

timings,worse
i just checked the timings using mysql 5 and they are slightly worse than postgresql

picky,pickier,fields,select
postgresql is picky pickier than mysql -- all fields in the select list when using distinct must be present in the order_by and group_by clauses

slower,query,background
do you find rails with postgresql is slower than mysql knowing that it produce more query on the background

tuning,optimal,performance
postgresql requires more tuning than mysql to achieve optimal performance

tricks,complicated,queries,optimizer
in general postgresql knows more tricks for how to optimize complicated queries than the mysql optimizer does but it also relies heavily on your having given the optimizer enough data to work with

complete,solid,queries,optimization,retrieval,speed
postgresql is much more complete and solid and will much better support complex queries and their optimization while mysql may shine in terms of retrieval speed for extremely simple queries

run,4x,faster
mysql run 4x faster than postgresql

personal,openion,slower,mongo
in my personal openion mysql is slower than postgresql and mongo db

query,optimizer,advanced,complicated,statements
the query optimizer in postgresql is more advanced than in mysql and copes with complicated statements much better especially when it comes to sub-selects

experience,faster,big,tables
according to my own experience postgresql run much faster than mysql especially handling big tables 1.4 gb lineitem table in my case

faster,transactions,sound
mysql i am told can be optimized to do faster reads than postgresql but both are pretty ridiculously fast in terms of # transactions sec they support and it doesn t sound like that s your problem

version,faster,advanced,spatial
mysql s version is apparently marginally faster than postgresql but lacks some of the more advanced spatial features therefore it s pretty much limited to finding records that match a certain range of coordinates

slower,certain,point
postgresql is already slower than mysql up to a certain point it is actually faster when you have a ridiculously large database

expirience,slower
i ve found that postgresql is in my expirience is slower as mysql

database, hosts, instance, ---------------------------------------------------

correct,database,implementation,compliant
from how i understand it postgresql is a more correct database implementation while mysql is less correct less compliant but faster

good,popular,hosts,database,instance
postgresql is good too but mysql is undoubtedly more popular and you re going to find more hosts that provide you a mysql database for instance if that matters

easier, features, options, ---------------------------------------------------

easier,aspects,logical
you might look at postgresql as i find it a bit easier to manage and maintain as i feel some aspects are more logical than mysql

sql,features,advanced,tendency,things
however postgresql s sql features are far more advanced than mysql s and mysql has a tendency to silently ignore things you tell it to do - especially in a default installation and if you rely on a foreign key to be created that might be a very unpleasant surprise

little,easier,cool,features
mysql is more widely supported and a little easier to use but postgresql has some very cool features and functionality that s worth taking a gander at

easier,simplicity,advantage
postgresql specifically has gotten easier to manage while mysql has lost some of the simplicity that gave it an advantage without picking up enough features that really matter

capable,features,queries,datatypes,tuning,options
i suggest postgresql it s more capable has more features and better support for complex queries and datatypes than mysql and has a lot of tuning options

easy,replication,nicer
mysql has some advantages like easy replication but postgresql is generally nicer to work with

cleaner,easier
however people often argue that postgresql is cleaner and easier to use that mysql

worse
i am using postgresql before which i tried mysql mysql is even worse

open, source, smarter, ---------------------------------------------------

open,source,smarter
if you want open source postgresql is much smarter than mysql as well

better,solution,open,source
personally i think mysql would be a better solution then postgresql if you are looking for an open source solution but keep in mind open source sql solutions with not be the easiest when it comes to scalability or a high availability environment if that is your ultimate goal

security, fewer, surprises, ---------------------------------------------------

security,aware,roles,authentication
i d have said that postgresql is more security aware than mysql supporting roles more authentication methods ... but that the database itself has generally a very limited impact on the security of an application

beginner,fewer,surprises
i would recommend postgresql for a beginner as it has far fewer surprises than mysql

fewer,security,issues
traditionally postgresql has had fewer security issues than mysql but they are both doing very well on that

others---------------------------------------------------

capable,needs,alex,suggestion
mysql is more than capable of serving your needs as well as alex s suggestion of postgresql

corruption,frequent
problems with corruption seem to be more frequent with mysql than with postgresql

superior,hate,bizarre,bugs,performance,better,complicated,query
as i said postgresql is far superior and i hate mucking with mysql s bizarre bugs and i think that overall postgresql performance is probably better than mysql for any even slightly complicated query

better,handling,sub-selects,like,users
i also personally believe that postgresql has better handling of complex queries that include sub-selects and the like which most mysql users used to avoid

acid,compliant,fks,post
all that said postgresql is much more acid compliant than mysql it handles fks just as you re needing and i would generally recommend it based on what you ve expressed in your post

team,favor
does that mean perhaps rails team favor postgresql slightly more than mysql

forum,posts,realistic
or maybe i want to use mysql for forum posts but postgresql for geo-clustering more realistic for me heh

similar
postgresql is much more similar to oracle than mysql is

poor,performance,smart,plan,sql,server,oracle
poor performance from mysql has more to do with it not being smart and automatically creating an optimized plan like sql server postgresql or oracle would

preferred,choise,projects,symfony,rare,decision
mysql is more preferred db choise for symfony projects symfony mysql symfony postgresql so choosing postgresql is a rare decision and maybe there are some pitfalls those we have to consider

sane,tricks
since postgresql is a lot more sane than mysql there are not that many tricks to report on

larger,user,base,popularity,several
while mysql has a larger user base postgresql is gaining more an more popularity ever since implementing several crucial features that were missing in earlier versions

suffice,large,read,switch,advantageous,heavy
my question is that will postgresql suffice for having such a large number of entries while performing both read and writes or should i switch to mysql because i heard mysql is more advantageous to read heavy tasks

comfortable,production,add-ons,offers
if you are more comfortable with mysql because you should install postgresql locally if you are going to use postgresql for production then you should consider using one of the mysql add-ons heroku offers

concerned,outstanding,fiddling,configuration
the big question as far as i m concerned is still outstanding -- will postgresql require more fiddling and configuration to run well than mysql

note,work,simpler
note i m not saying mysql s license won t work for you but postgresql is definitely simpler

reliability,reliable,myisam,innodb
as for reliability i think that postgresql is more reliable especially when compared to mysql using myisam - innodb is a lot better here

incomplete,version,opengis,support,proper,indexing,geospatial,actions,better,postgis,debate
in fact this presentation which still refers to an older incomplete version of mysql s opengis support suggests that with proper indexing some mysql geospatial actions may actually perform better than postgresql postgis though i m sure that s up for debate

webapps,enterprisey
that s why it s usually said that mysql is best for webapps while postgresql is more enterprisey

pyqt,available,splendid,open-source,engine,standard,py-postgresql
for example pyqt is already available for python 3 as well as 2 and you can use postgresql a splendid open-source sql database engine much more standard than mysql via py-postgresql

use,indexes,bigger,repertoar,gist,gin
b use indexes - postgresql has bigger repertoar of indexes then mysql so use it - there are gist gin indexes

license,bsd,simple
postgresql license bsd is undoubtedly more simple than mysql s

older
postgresql is older than mysql so it might have influenced them

thing
mysql is not less complicated that postgresql -- they re the same thing

queries,100ms,complex,activerecord,15s,nested,loops
i had mentioned that in our rails application all select queries dropped below 100ms after switching to postgresql whereas some of the complex joins generated by activerecord would occasionally take as much as 15s or more with mysql 5.1 because of nested loops with inner table scans even when indices were available

time
may be postgresql takes less time than mysql

incase,things
i am using postgresql btw which can do more than mysql incase that changes things

capable,django
why postgresql is more capable than others mysql etc. on django

part,larger,task
mysql is probably part of the problem but updating to postgresql would be a larger task than i want to commit to right now

forgiving,reserved,word
it seems mysql is more forgiving with this than postgresql but in every case you use a reserved word you should escape it

security,features,integration,gssapi,logins,last
postgresql supports some more security features than mysql for example integration with gssapi or kerberos for logins last i checked mysql didn t have these

first,answer,compliant,standard,group,clause
following the first answer it appears that postgresql is more compliant to sql standard than mysql so it needs a group by clause for each selected column you want to display with your aggregated function

drupal,higher,pdo
drupal 7 mysql 5.0.15 or higher with pdo postgresql 8.3 or higher

current,environment,strict
this works fine on my local and current hosted environment using mysql but postgresql is clearly more strict

optional,hstore,module,better,this.
postgresql with the optional hstore module might be better than mysql at this.

involved,dan,dumpdata,dbase,settings,loaddata,new
secondly would migrating from mysql to postgresql be more involved dan doing a dumpdata on the mysql dbase change the settings to point to postgresql and the loaddata on the new backend

ps,smarter,right,indexes
ps you can also migrate to postgresql it s smarter than mysql when choosing right indexes

established,support,last,year
postgresql has more established support for this but mysql has played catch up in the last year or so and has a working method of this in the latest versions

triggers,syntax,complex,procedures,action
triggers in postgresql have a syntax a bit more complex than mysql because they execute procedures as the action

indexes,size,table,data,lesser,sizes
mysql indexes were occupying more size than the table data itself and postgresql was using considerably lesser sizes

advanced
postgresql is worth learning and much more advanced than mysql

wonder,single,insert,statement,faster,autocommit
i wonder why postgresql s single insert statement is completely faster than mysql s when autocommit is turned on

django,easy,query,data,faster,x10,shows,indexes
with django it is easy to use postgresql instead of mysql so i tried it with the same query and same data in db postgresql is much faster that mysql x10 more faster while using inner join analyse shows it uses indexes unlike mysql

higher,metadata,overhead,data,files,chunks,obvious,wastes,space,cure
i suppose postgresql could have higher metadata overhead than mysql or has to extend its data files in larger chunks but i can t find anything obvious that postgresql wastes space for which migrating to mysql is the cure

useful
explain in postgresql is way more useful than in mysql

mature,thanks,mvcc,row-locking,feature,token,field
i know postgresql could be considered more mature than mysql with regards to locking thanks to mvcc - can i use row-locking or some other feature in postgresql instead of the token field

systems,great,licensing,standards,compliance,easier
i ve used both db systems before and while postgresql is great for it s licensing terms and standards compliance mysql is definitely easier to get up and running quickly

ugly,heads,name,attractive
for large and complicated systems yes there are enough bugs quirks that can rear their ugly heads - i am convinced that the reason that people tend to always go with mysql over postgresql is that the name mysql is much more attractive

able,server,safer,bet
if i were able to upgrade the server s versioning of mysql to 5.5 would innodb be a safer bet than postgresql

weak,point,better,changes,rollbacks
this is a weak point that iirc postgresql can handle better but with mysql you have to work around that by reverting the changes yourself in case of rollbacks
