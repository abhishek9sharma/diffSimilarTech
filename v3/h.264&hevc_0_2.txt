edit,h.265,better,compression,size,support,widespread,stick
edit h.265 hevc is even better at compression 50 of h.264 size in some cases but support is not yet widespread so stick with h.264 for now

sizes,larger
at the qualities i m recording 720p or 1080p the file size of an hevc-encoded video should be 40-60 of an identical h.264-encoded video and i am seeing this when i use the default camera app on ios but when i use avassetwriter as above or in the project linked above i m seeing file sizes be about three times larger with hevc than with h.264
