different,versions,tricky,redbook,topic
migration between different versions of websphere might be somewhat more tricky but i m sure ibm published at least one redbook on that topic

capabilities,ejb,sausage,faster,tomcat
it only adds some more java ee capabilities ejb and so on and of course the ibm sausage over it so i wouldn t expect websphere to be much faster than tomcat

easier,application,developer
ibm makes it easier for those who can t afford websphere application developer or rational application developer which are both eclipse flavour to use eclipse

technote,details,signal,matter,application,server
this ibm technote has more details on the signals part what is a signal and why does this matter for websphere application server

development,studio,wdsc,older,date,article
websphere development studio v7 wdsc is older than ibm i 6.1 your build date is 2007 the article you re referencing came out in 2008

weblogic,ee,similar,strategies,liberty,profile
oracle s other application server weblogic still doesn t even fully support java ee 7 - both they and ibm seem to have similar strategies of maintaining stability in their full-fat releases while being more bleeding edge with glassfish for oracle and the liberty profile for ibm s websphere
