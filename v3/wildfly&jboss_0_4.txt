eap,slower,release
jboss eap which is based on wildfly deliberately has a slower release schedule

problems,strict,looks
jboss 6.4 had no problems with that but yes wildfly is more strict looks like

integration,easier,eap,support,ee,technologies
2 integration would be easier with jboss eap support from eap 5 or wildfly however if you don t need any java ee technologies i would go with more lightweight server like tomcat or jetty

request,response,kind,lightweight
is it because request response handling on wildfly is kind of more lightweight than the jboss 4.2.3
