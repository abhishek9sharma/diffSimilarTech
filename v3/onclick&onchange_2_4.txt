note, better, respond, ---------------------------------------------------

respond,checkbox,events,reliable
here s something that should get you started - this is all based on the assumption that there are only 3 checkboxes on your whole page and that you re interested in all of them - you ll want to make a method like this respond to your checkbox elements onclick events - i ve found that to be more reliable than onchange

note,better,checkbox,radio,button
note that onclick is better supported with checkbox and radio button than is onchange

others---------------------------------------------------

checkbox,meaningful
checkbox onchange should be more meaningful than onclick

event,elegant
maybe using the event onchange instead of onclick would be more elegant
