faster, static, file, ---------------------------------------------------

better
also what makes nginx better than apache in this case

varnish,faster
you can serve it from for example nginx varnish which are usually faster than apache

static,file,performance,faster
for static file serving i found nginx performance lot faster than apache

consensus,static,content,faster
there seems to be a consensus that nginx serves static content faster than apache

better
how can nginx performs better than apache

faster,projects
i read that nginx is faster than apache and i want to try it with some of the projects and leave the others with apache

faster
for example nginx is much faster than apache

expert,deployment,faster,friendly
i am not an expert in deployment but in my experience nginx is much faster and more friendly to django compared to apache

main,higher,performance
one of the main advantages people discuss when choosing nginx over apache is higher performance in serving large numbers of static file so when using laravel are those static files loaded as dynamic php files

faster,static,files,point,worth,dynamic,content
i will add that i ve often heard that nginx is faster than apache for serving static files to the point that it s sometimes worth using nginx for static files and reverse proxying to apache for dynamic content

easier,opinion
nginx is actually quite a lot easier than apache in my opinion

faster,configuration,easier
nginx is faster than apache and the configuration is easier

faster
nginx is still faster and i might choose it but apache isn t asleep

great,faster
nginx works great by itself and will likely be much faster than apache

memory,size,setup
nginx uses less memory than apache given the size of your setup i would definitely recommend that

optimizations,faster
nginx â without any optimizations done â is much faster than apache

features,lighter,faster,lighttpd
if you aren t using any of the other features of apache consider using something lighter and faster like lighttpd or nginx

faster
and finally from my experience nginx is faster than apache

traffic,sites,slower,varnish,front
we have a few clients who have very high traffic sites running apache slower than nginx with varnish in front of it and they get way more traffic than you are saying with little to no performance problems

faster
i have recently read that nginx is faster than apache

faster,slow,clients
nginx is faster than apache handles slow clients better and is generally easier to use

picky,file,names
nginx is more picky about case of file names than apache

static,files,efficient
serving static files with nginx is much more efficient than with apache

faster
paradoxally it does not mean that apache is faster than nginx it just means that on 1 2 3 .

faster,static,content
not only is nginx supposedly faster than apache at delivering static content but this also offloads your rails application for every image stylesheet javascript or whatever other static content

better
nginx makes apache better

memory,static,file
i switched from apache to nginx to save memory especially to serve static file i seem to be using about 75 less memory with nginx

better
i want to move to nginx since it s better than apache

popular,features,smaller,faster
apache is more popular and has more features nginx is smaller and faster and has less features

info,faster,static,pages
when i was googling info on nginx it appears to be faster than apache and works well in serving static pages

faster,low,request
nginx is typically faster than apache but with a low request server it hardly matters

faster,site,switch,performance,problems
however since i m used to apache it was faster for me to configure the site to run on apache and switch to nginx when performance problems occured

static,file,performance,better
nginx s static file performance is better than apache

faster,static,pages,performance
i ve read that nginx is faster for static pages but there are questions about its performance with php compared to apache s performance with php

wisdom,django,server,front,static,files,performant
it seems to be common wisdom that if you are deploying django on an apache server then you should still put an nginx server in front of the application to serve static files at which nginx is more performant

easier,faster
for me apache is easier to use but i prefer nginx as it is much faster

faster,nodejs,application
for example nginx is considered faster than apache and a nodejs application is considered faster than a php application

static,assets,faster
very fast static assets nginx is faster than apache at serving static assets css js images ... and uses very little memory to do so

lower,memory,little,faster,static,files
i know nginx has lower memory footprint and little faster than apache in serving static files

faster
nginx will definitely work faster than apache

little,slower,bench
it s just a little slower than using apache bench directly against nginx

experience,complex,worker,efficient
however my experience is that configuring it in apache is significantly more complex than configuring it in nginx and even with worker it still is not quite as efficient with nginx

better, long, polling, ---------------------------------------------------

performant,high-levels,requests
nginx is more performant than apache in most cases with high-levels of requests

better,requests,process,request
nginx is better at handling requests since it does not spawn a new process for every request unlike apache

server,efficient
nginx or other server is not much more efficient than apache

use,things,better,server
further than that i wouldn t use apache at all if i needed to optimize things nginx is much better as a server it s even faster than node.js for serving static files for example

configuration,flexible,front,end
also nginx s configuration is much more flexible than apache and by having it on the front end it gives you a lot of flexibility

setting,server,resources
also when your setting up the server i would say start with nginx it s uses less resources than apache

users,lighttpd,long,polling
as such i m assuming that about 96 of our users will being using apache and not lighttpd or nginx which are supposedly more suited for long polling

server,images,better
using nginx rather than apache to server the images nginx generally works better to server static content such as this

different,server,lighttpd,easier
using a different server such as one apache and one nginx or one apache and one lighttpd will be much easier because their configuration files don t conflict with each other

better,long,polling
4 i d like to understand why nginx might be better than apache when one is long polling and why long polling is better than periodically polling a server

id,love,better,issue,fuelphp
id love to know how to solve this since using nginx sometimes is a better option than apache and having this issue with fuelphp framework and not being able to use this two great tools together is awful

kind,things,painfull,easier
but doing that kind of things with apache is rather painfull and is easier with nginx

cores,better,client,requests
16 cores apache would scale better than nginx while nginx would process more client requests

better,async
you don t want to use apache because nginx is better suited since nginx is built for async i o

front,better,opinion
having nginx in front of apache is a better set up in my opinion

heavier,loads,better,look
i will say that nginx tends to handle heavier loads better than apache though so take a look at that

requests,predefined,pattern,easier
nginx can be configured to only respond to requests matching a predefined pattern far easier than with apache

claim,performance,good,better
apache made a claim that apache 2.4 will offer performance as good or better than nginx

rewrites,complicated
i am not going into how to do rewrites on nginx because it is much more complicated than apache

scripts,background,better,solution
would be for running many php scripts all the same in the background - nginx be the better solution or apache

gunicorn,likely,better,modwsgi,point
nginx + gunicorn is likely to work better than apache + modwsgi at this point in time

model,efficient
next you ll find that the threading model of nginx is much more efficient than apache s for what you re doing

php-fpm,challenge,better
also you can run php behind nginx using php-fpm but that s quite a challenge to get working and for that reason apache may be a better choice

lemp,small,projects,better
i think you would like lemp e stands for the nginx and for a lot small projects it would be better than apache

better,long,polling
why nginx might be better than apache when one is long polling and why long polling is better than periodically polling a server

uwsgi,better
uwsgi is better if you are using nginx i find nginx far better than apache personally

proper,multi-thread,architecture,better,multi-core,cpus
now back to the question my guess based on reading tests published here would be that the proper multi-thread apache architecture should scale better than nginx on multi-core cpus

better,logfiles
nginx also happens to be better than apache at writing logfiles interestingly

great,scripts,lighttpd,comfortable
letâ s encrypt provides great scripts for apache 2 and nginx but not lighttpd which is much more comfortable for small systems like raspberry pi or old boxes

pattern,capable,respects
i have used this pattern with apache before and nginx seems more capable in most respects so i m sure this must be possible

mod_wsgi,better
nginx with its own mod_wsgi seems to perform even better than apache but hey you didn t ask about that

apps,lighter,example,lighttpd,configurations
just one tip if only job for the http server will be just proxying the play apps consider using some lighter option than apache for an example nginx or lighttpd you ll find sample configurations for all of them in play s documentation

concurrent,clients,better,fork,new
the remote server is set up to allow very few maximum concurrent clients generally nginx handles many concurrent clients better than apache since it doesn t need to fork a new process for every request so if it becomes an issue you might want to look into switching web servers

gunicorn,better,uwsgi,options,mod_python,django
as other already suggested nginx + gunicorn or better nginx + uwsgi are better options than apache + mod_python to serve your django app

front,better,asynchronous,node
if you want to use something in front of it though i suggest you use something like nginx better than apache since nginx is also asynchronous like node and it s performs really well at serving static files

heart,better,server
i aways heart that nginx performs better than apache server

dont,recomend,better,nodejs
i dont recomend apache to do these nginx fits better with nodejs

requirement,possible,better
i don t know from your question if it s a requirement to keep using apache but if possible i think nginx would work much better for you here

reverse,proxy,performance,better
i recommend you to use nginx as an reverse proxy since the configuration is easier and the performance is much better than apache

server,flexible
also you should consider using nginx as server that s more flexible than apache

better,light,single,threaded,thread,request
nginx is better suited than apache as it is light and single threaded vs apache thread per request in most normal setups

web, faster, concurrency, ---------------------------------------------------

django,mod_python,faster,lighty,fastcgi
as for apache vs nginx in regards to your django app it seems that mod_python is indeed faster than nginx lighty + fastcgi but that s no surprise because cgi regardless of any speed ups is still slow

recent,innovations,lighty,web,servers,better,higher,concurrency
although this thread is more than a year old it still merits from the fact that no one mentioned about the not so recent innovations of nginx lighty and other web servers which scale much better than apache at higher concurrency and consume lesser resources

web,server,requests,concurrency,non-blocking,nature
i m currently using apache as web server but i have heard that nginx can handle more requests with more concurrency than that of apache because of the non-blocking nature of the system

everyone,great,faster,setup,multiple
hi everyone i need help with this i ve already set up nginx + php and it works great faster than apache my problem is how to setup a multiple projects in one ip

tomcat,web,server,past,slowness,lighter,faster
i have configured tomcat with apache web server in past and never slowness problem before and practically speaking nginx is said to much lighter and faster than apache web server

able,thing,mod_rewrite,equivalent,better,performance
if this is what you re really trying to do rather than a simplified example you may be able to accomplish the same thing with apache mod_rewrite or the equivalent in nginx and have better performance since you re not executing any php code at that point

different,server,lighttpd,overhead,traditional,setup
it may even use a different server software say nginx or lighttpd that has less overhead than the traditional apache setup

faster,lighter,easier,.htaccess,support,analog,performance
nginx is faster and lighter but many people find it easier to work with apache because of .htaccess support nginx does not have an analog due to performance concern

idea,someone,better,small,tasks,requests,proxy,mind
i have no idea what i m doing so i dove nose-first into nginx -- which i had never used before -- because someone told me it s better than apache at dealing with lots of small tasks and requests -- not that i would know how to turn apache into a proxy mind you

use,reverse,proxy,front,node.js,better,solution
i ve heard it suggested that i use nginx as a reverse proxy in front of apache and node.js is that a better solution than just nginx

php-fpm,server,operations,faster,mod-php,efficient
is nginx + php-fpm is suppose to do server operations much faster than apache + mod-php due to efficient usage of memory and other resources

tornadoweb,popular,web,better,performance,certain,circumstances
tornadoweb and nginx are popular web servers for the moment and many benchmarkings show that they have a better performance than apache under certain circumstances

proxy,layer,better,performance,nodejs,server
note that in any case for increased security and fast static file css js delivery you might want to add a reverse proxy layer nginx usually provides better performance but apache works as well before the nodejs python server

performance,bad,use,thread,connection,better
if you have long-running requests i think the performance will be pretty bad because apache use one thread per connection nginx performs much better

mod_wsgi,setup,slow,http,clients,better,fewer
apache mod_wsgi will actually benefit from this as well if everything is setup properly as nginx will isolate apache from slow http clients allowing apache to perform better with fewer resources

mod_php,stable,cleaner,http,bad
apache mod_php is much more stable and cleaner while nginx will often deliver http bad gateway error coded in 502

connections, memory, mode, ---------------------------------------------------

look,fast,memory,client,connections
also have a look at nginx for example it is fast and uses less memory than apache to handle client connections

php-cgi,processes,apc,cache,memory
however i m on a memory limited vps and i d rather not run one set of php-cgi processes for nginx with their own apc cache and another for apache using more memory for their apc cache

lighttpd,fastcgi,mode,ram,concurrent,connections
nginx or lighttpd in fastcgi mode use less ram than apache and they can handle more concurrent connections

need, ffmpeg, specific, ---------------------------------------------------

need,ffmpeg,alot,easier
there is no need to use apache or ffmpeg nginx would be alot easier

quicker,struggle,specific,need
nginx is quicker though honestly you ll struggle to see the difference except for very high volume sites and has quickly become the web server of choice for a lot of people if you don t have any specific need for apache for your code

others---------------------------------------------------

syntax,configuration,different,clean
the syntax for nginx configuration is different but more clean than apache

switchover,little,rule,default,upstream,version,centos,rules,straight
the switchover to nginx really had little to do with the rewrite rule and more to do with getting away from apache 2.2 default upstream version for centos however with nginx rewrite rules are more straight forward than apache s imo

ups,worse,job
i m about to try apache but most write ups suggest that this is worse than nginx at this job

reverse,proxy,cache,static,files,offloads,requests,output,compression
then make nginx reverse proxy to apache cache all static files which offloads that from apache because nginx serves them instead meaning apache can do more php requests and also get nginx to perform output compression

memory
also nginx uses a lot less memory than apache

familiar,combo,fastcgi,setup
i am more familiar with apache php combo rather than say nginx and fastcgi with php setup so focusing on this area

new,faster,resource-hungry,hard,thing
i m new to nginx and want to try it out since it apparently is much faster and less resource-hungry than apache but i can t see why this would be such a hard thing to achieve

famous,line,words,better,ways
the famous line is nginx is not apache in other words nginx has better ways to handle urls than rewriting

phpbrew,simpler,simple,humble
i ve been attempting to upgrade to php 7.1 using phpbrew and elected to install it with nginx as i read everywhere that it was simpler than apache not that simple in my humble opinion

servers,lighthttp,large,amounts,traffic,memory,power,flexibility
servers like lighthttp and nginx can handle large amounts of traffic in much less memory than apache if you can sacrifice apache s power and flexibility or if you just don t need those things which often you don t

common,examples,famous,popular,websites,facebook.com
common examples of this software include apache most famous popular - runs like 40 of all websites you browse including facebook.com and nginx becoming more popular

proxy,systems,popular,easier,configuration,https
any one of the reverse proxy systems can likely do this nginx is popular too and generally has easier configuration than apache but i ve never used it with https

comfortable,exciting
i m significantly more comfortable with apache but learning to use nginx has been pretty exciting or as exciting as learning to configure a new webserver can be

haproxy,experience
i also know there is nginx and haproxy although i have never used either of them and have a lot more experience with apache

flexable,high,price
apache is more flexable then nginx but it comes with a high price in performance

select,epoll,--with-select_module,efficient
in fact nginx can use select instead of epoll if you compile it with the --with-select_module option and i bet it will still be more efficient than apache

busy
it seems your apache is more busy than your nginx

ferrari
apache is like a 4 by 4 contains everything you need nginx is more like a ferrari not much there but it does what you need it to

slower,event,mpm,http,proxy,varnish,haproxy,front,worker
it is slower than nginx because apache with the event mpm is very roughly equivalent to an event-driven http proxy nginx varnish haproxy in front of apache with the worker mpm

design,thread,client,reactor,pattern,meaning,traffic,web,server
apache s design is thread per client while nginx uses the reactor pattern meaning - nginx can handle much more traffic than apache as a web server about 50 times the number of requests

friendly,configuration,htpasswd,rules,regard,static
apache is more friendly configuration wise htaccess htpasswd rewrite rules etc nginx is fast in regard to static assets

event,non,usage,lower
nginx uses an event based non blocking single thread and the memory usage is relatively much lower than apache

b,familiar,easy
i would give you more info except a ip aliasing on centos 7 is more involved than i like much easier on solaris and b i m not familiar at all with configuring nginx very easy on apache

lighter
nginx is very fast much lighter than apache
