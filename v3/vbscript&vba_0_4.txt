similarities,angst,ease
i ve written vbscript but the similarities to vba cause me more angst than ease

regex,similar,api
and since you asked for a work-around if you have access to visual studio you could whip up a little com-visible class library that exposes a .net-flavored regex much more similar to java s than vbscript s api that you could reference and use in your vba code

vb6,little,better,similar,issues
vb6 vba though a little better than vbscript in general still has many similar issues where for their domain they require much more boiler plate to do simple tasks than what i would like and have seen in other scripting languages

reports,lines,edit,oregonghost,sense,vb.net
i believe that the reports are using something more along the lines of vbscript edit oregonghost says vba which actually makes more sense than vbscript than vb.net and very limited at that
