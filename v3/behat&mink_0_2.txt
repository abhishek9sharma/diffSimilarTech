useful,purpose
i would say behat + mink is more useful for that purpose

web,applications,faster
often especially when using mink to test web applications you will find that behat goes faster than your web application can keep up - it will try and click links or perform actions before the page has had chance to load and therefore result in a failing test that would have otherwise passed
