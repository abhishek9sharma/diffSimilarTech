small,words,shorter,function,unroll,loops
using options such as -os for the compiler to tell it to make the code small in other words don t inline-functions unless the code is shorter by inlining than by calling the function and don t unroll loops etc etc - but do inline-functions called only once as that does make the code shorter

compilers,better,use,function,contemporary,calls
compilers are getting better with inlining the use of function pointers where the function is actually known but contemporary compilers certainly don t always inline-functions calls through function pointers even if all the context would be there

decision,user,non-specified,control
i m well aware that inline is more of compiler decision than of user going so far as even to inlining non-specified inline-functions so the user control is almost negligible
