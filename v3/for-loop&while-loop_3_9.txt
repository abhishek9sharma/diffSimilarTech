cleaner, faster, ---------------------------------------------------

cleaner
edit just realized a while-loop may well be a lot cleaner than a for-loop for this

faster
i have also found that a while-loop is faster than a for-loop

faster
and now we know that for-loop is faster than while-loop

others---------------------------------------------------

greater,cost,compiler
also it seems like a for-loop is of greater cost to the compiler than a while-loop

loops,point,prone,endless
if you re just going to loops through point use a for-loop as while-loop is more prone to dropping into an endless loops if you forgot to increment counter or doing wrongly or do it in multiple places

second,slower,cheaper,equivalent,iterations
the reason for the second case much slower on sorted data is that a while-loop is cheaper than the equivalent for-loop when there are zero iterations

compact
you can think of the for-loop being a more compact way of writing the while-loop

logic,better
ok i think i may have fixed my problem i changed the logic and so i m now using a for-loop i could have still used a while-loop but i think a for-loop is better

curiosity,solution,appropriate,first
i searched a lot and discovered nice approaches of others that do solve my problem but out of curiosity i would love to know if there is solution to my problem that keeps the while-loop despite a for-loop would be more appropriate in the first place as i know the range but the day will come when i will need a while loops
