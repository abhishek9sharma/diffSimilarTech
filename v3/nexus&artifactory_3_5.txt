filesystem, maven-centric, database, ---------------------------------------------------

better,fair,flame
i will not argue why and if nexus is better than artifactory as it would not be fair and would only cause flame wars

full,support,maven-centric,better
if they are going to use any non-maven way to retrieve them ui rest scripts ant gradle then you can go with any path and name you like and you ll get full support from artifactory uploading searching etc. with nexus which is much more maven-centric you ll better stick to maven notation

better,filesystem,database
nexus looks better choice than artifactory because of using filesystem instead of database to keep repository

others---------------------------------------------------

better
i would recommend artifactory much better than the nexus

price,support,pro,makes,users,point,cheaper
on price and support alone then nexus pro makes sense until you get to 67 users at which point artifactory becomes the cheaper option
