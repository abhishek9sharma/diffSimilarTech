child, value, solution, ---------------------------------------------------

solution,box-sizing,lower,value
there is one more solution besides setting box-sizing border-box and using a lower width value

wide,box-sizing,button,larger,percentage
but the button in your example is less than 15px wide so even with box-sizing border-box the button s width is pushed larger than your percentage

screen,child,min-width,box-sizing,display-inline-block,parent
if you need to have both fill the screen when the child is less than the width of the screen then both need min-width 100 and box-sizing border-box and you can remove the display-inline-block from the parent

box-sizing,total,content,padding,border,larger,element,browser
my question is when we declare box-sizing border-box and the total width of content and padding and border are larger than the width that is declared for the element how does the browser solve this case
