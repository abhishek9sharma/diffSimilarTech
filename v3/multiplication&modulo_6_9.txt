slower, priority, integer, ---------------------------------------------------

lower,precedence,addition,operations
it might seem unintuitive but it has a lower precedence than multiplication addition and modulo operations

redundant,division,priority,higher,precedence
note parentheses are redundant as division and multiplication have the same priority and modulo has higher precedence over addition

division,precedence,higher
multiplication division and modulo have the same precedence and they all have higher precedence than addition and subtraction

lower,precedence,division
it appears that you consider modulo to have lower precedence than multiplication and division when in fact it does not

integer,division,slower
integer multiplication division and modulo are much slower than integer addition and subtraction

others---------------------------------------------------

division,costly,addition,easy,underflow,operations
implementing multiplication and division might be more costly than you would like but at least addition is easy modulo protecting against over underflow and you claim to not need any operations so even better

method,larger,number,modular,inverse
this has some advantages over the original method when n is larger than the modulo divided by 2 since we can reduce the number of multiplication by solving for the modular inverse

equivalent,faster,slower
note that is equivalent to i 10 but much faster since modulo is around 10 times slower than multiplication

inverse,time,seconde,division,sub,10k,core,functions,number
inverse modulo for 300 time take 1.422 seconde more than executing division sub and multiplication 10k time even the core of inverse modulo is build with same division and sub and multiplication functions and for this number it just do 150 time inside while help plz why
