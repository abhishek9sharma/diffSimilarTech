data,camera,low-level,faster
i d like to use mediacodec to encode the data coming from the camera reason it s more low-level so hopefully faster than using mediarecorder

gles,examples,idea,simpler
the gles recording examples uses mediacodec rather than mediarecorder but the idea is the same and it should be much simpler with mediarecorder

surface,input,convenient
android 5.0 api 21 allows surface input to mediarecorder which is often much more convenient than mediacodec
