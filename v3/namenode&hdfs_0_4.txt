single-point-of-failure,reliable,hardware
since the namenode is a single-point-of-failure in hdfs it requires a more reliable hardware setup

high,availabilty,available
hdfs high availabilty is only available when you have more than one namenode configured

file,larger,size,process,full,memory,contention
it s almost always suggested that each file in hdfs be much larger than the block size to increase the likelihood of a process reading a full block and to reduce namenode memory contention

involved,process,dfs.replication.min,copies
it s a more involved process with namenode assuring that at least dfs.replication.min copies are written to hdfs
