project,better,main_class
i think that s why i can t use to launch my project this way works but jar way is better because everything including the main_class is described in manifest.mf

file,jar-relative,class-path,entry,sufficient
putting it in the jar file among the classes or adding its jar-relative path to the class-path entry of the jar s manifest.mf file is more than sufficient
