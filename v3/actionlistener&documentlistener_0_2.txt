text,field,wary,focuslistener,suitable
create the text field and register the documentlistener to it...although i d be wary about using a documentlistener personally maybe a actionlistener and or focuslistener might be more suitable but hay

text,field,useful,information,underlying,appropriate,conditions
firstly i wouldn t use a keylistener to monitor changes to a text field a documentlistener would provide more useful information to the changes of the underlying field but an actionlistener would probably be more appropriate under these conditions
