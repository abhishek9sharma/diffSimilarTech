stream,answer,realtime,access
i used fleshgrinder s filter class to replace r with n in the stream see accepted answer and replaced fgets with fgetc to get more realtime access to contents of stdout

function,single,char,simpler
fgetc is a function to read a single char simpler than using fgets

multiple,calls,faster,overhead,latter
if not multiple fgets calls will still be faster than multiple fgetc calls because the overhead of the latter will be greater
