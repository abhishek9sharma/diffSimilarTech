faster, better, ---------------------------------------------------

faster,better
is there any reason mousedown should be inherently faster better than mouseup

better
first off consider whether you really want to override mousedown or whether overriding mouseup might be a better option

others---------------------------------------------------

position
something like if mousedown position is more than 10px away from mouseup position

date,stuff,button,self
as you ve already done you can set a date on mousedown and do stuff until mouseup then do something more based on how long the button was held down for hopefully the following is self explanatory

mouse,keydown,keyup,sense
logic to handle enter + mouse click is placed on keydown and mousedown it could be moved to keyup and mouseup if makes more sense

events,slower,press,screen
when testing both cases it seems that mouseup events are slower and less reliable sometimes the button press is missed or the screen hangs slightly before responding than mousedown
