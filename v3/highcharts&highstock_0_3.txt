functionality,better,application,range
since most of the functionality of highcharts is found in highstock you re probably better off to just use highstock for whatever application needs the range selector

chart,specific,candlesticks
i have a chart in highcharts to be more specific it s a highstock chart candlesticks type and now i want to add some svg shapes to it

error,source
in other cases i ve gotten an error that says highcharts was loaded more than once but i m not using highstock which is apparently the source of this error
