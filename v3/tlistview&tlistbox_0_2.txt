use,data,property,icons,better
i know tlistbox renders like this but i require the use of tlistview for the data property also the tlistview handles icons better via a timagelist

needs,multi-column,vsreport,mode,better
depending on your actual needs which you did not explain a multi-column tlistview in vsreport mode may be a better choice than a tlistbox
