result, bits, lower, ---------------------------------------------------

issue,result,bigger,bits,negative,number
i was thinking that there could be an issue if the result from the addition is bigger than what 15 bits can represent 32767 or if i get a negative number in the subtraction

result,lower,bits,original
by the way the result of this addition taking its lower 8 bits discarding the carry bit is the result of the original subtraction

slower, logic, level, ---------------------------------------------------

division,level,logic,slower
division is performed by repeated subtraction therefore needs more level of subtract logic making division slower than addition

mess,things,slower,unlikely
it s possible though that software could mess things up by making subtraction slower than addition - but that s unlikely

chip,architecture,slower
this is a hold over from older compilers and interpreters on old chip architecture that would do addition slightly slower than subtraction

faster
since addition can be faster then subtraction we add the offset instead of subtract it from 31

conceivable,slower
here it is conceivable that subtraction is slower than addition

bignum,little,slower
but i d think bignum subtraction is a little slower than bignum addition

multiplication, simple, powers, ---------------------------------------------------

operations,simple,multiplication,division,powers
the operations are always algebraically simple never involving anything more than addition multiplication subtraction division and taking powers

multiplication,division
apart from that multiplication is addition done more than once and division is subtraction done more than once

higher,precedence,multiplication
the only way it would be broken up differently would be if addition had a higher precedence than subtraction like multiplication does

others---------------------------------------------------

work
the subtraction case is going to require a little more work than addition in this code

a111,equal,better
a111 addition is equal or better than subtraction

functions,work,iteration
of course the relative overhead will be smaller for functions that do more work than one addition and one subtraction per iteration

strict,rare,common,image
strict addition is rare but subtraction is more common like when you subtract one image from its filtered one

script,test,faster,operation
re-order your script so the subtraction test is timed first then the addition and suddenly addition becomes the faster operation again
