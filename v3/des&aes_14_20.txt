sensitive, current, little, ---------------------------------------------------

timings,sensitive,faster
this shows that the timings are sensitive to buffering and that aes is faster than des

faster,result
aes will indeed yield a considerably faster result than des

faster,cpu,aes-ni
aes can be even much faster than des or 3des when the cpu supports aes-ni

slower,modern,hardware
des is usually substantially slower than aes on modern hardware and has keys that are far too short for modern use

faster,3des,default
if aes is negotiated it s faster than des and 3des used by default by older applications

little,faster,smaller
using des assuming it s a little faster than aes and requires a smaller key and

slower,current,requirements
des turned out to be even slower than aes but for my current requirements a much simpler algorythm rc4 is sufficient

better, effective, example, ---------------------------------------------------

analysis,rijndael-128,fast,bigger,size
according to this analysis aes rijndael-128 is more than twice as fast as des 3des with a bigger key size more secure

least,secure,3des,better
des is the least secure 3des is better but i d go for the aes

better,speedup,observations
if you used aes then you might see a better speedup over the des 3des observations

secure,triple,example
i ve read that aes encryption is more secure than the triple des encryption ms is using in their example above

example,flawed,algorithm,3des,better
you re using des in your example which is a flawed and obsolete algorithm alternatively use 3des so i suggest moving to aes which provides better encryption

care,secure,up-to-date,method
i know you said you don t care about how secure it is but if you chose des you might as well take aes it is the more up-to-date encryption method

effective,size,larger,triple
note that the effective key size of aes is larger than triple des

others---------------------------------------------------

original,designers,genius,effort,cryptographers,greater
the original des designers were genius but one could say that the aggregate effort of cryptographers for the aes has been far greater

hardware,failure,power,ones,antenna
turns out this was a hardware failure the aes commands need more power than the des crypto1 ones 50 more which the antenna failed to deliver at the reading range i was testing with

api,old,encrypted,text,3des,better,safer
how ever if you insist to use some api in java i have to say that des is really old way to encrypted text 3des desede or aes will be better and safer both of them have already been supported since java6

secure
also see why aes is more secure than des

steps,vulnerable
which steps of aes encryption makes it less vulnerable than des

unrelated,actual,slower,small,better
though it s unrelated to your actual question des is generally slower than aes at least in software so unless you really need to keep the key small aes is almost certainly a better choice
