better, class, dimitre, ---------------------------------------------------

dimitre,better,class
as dimitre says xslt is much better at this class of problem than xquery

class,problems,better
i hate to answer a request for a solution in language a by suggesting a solution in language b but what you are doing here falls into the class of problems which xslt handles much better than xquery

xml, convenient, simpler, ---------------------------------------------------

possible,convenient,xml
what you try to achieve is certainly possible with xquery or with xslt which is more convenient for transforming xml trees especially for multiple transform passes

convenient,xml,database,filesystem,simpler
i think xquery would be more convenient if you had all of your xml in a database but on the filesystem xslt may be simpler

kind, processing, expressive, ---------------------------------------------------

kind,processing,expressive
this kind of processing is most easily done with xslt which is more expressive than xquery

appropriate,kind,tasks
xslt is significantly more appropriate to use than xquery for such kind of tasks

others---------------------------------------------------

skills,xpath,languages,common,database,access
also with xquery you can re-use your existing skills with xslt + xpath as the languages have a lot in common but xquery is more geared towards database access

usual,rule-of-thumb,better,simple,tasks,complex
my usual rule-of-thumb is that xquery is better than xslt for simple tasks whereas xslt is better for complex tasks

small,changes,solution,simpler
if your output is going to be similar to your input with small changes then the xslt solution is often a lot simpler than the xquery solution

banal,better,transformation,source,document,query
generally i know it sounds banal xslt is better at transformation generating a new document from each source document while xquery is better at query extracting a small amount of information from each source document

xdm,model,xpath,stricter,free-standing
the xdm model used by xslt xpath xquery is much stricter it allows a free-standing zero-length text node but as soon as you try and add such a node to a tree it disappears

better,amenable,static,analysis,polymorphism,template,rules
xquery works better than xslt for this because it s more amenable to static analysis as it lacks the polymorphism of xslt s template rules

nicer
nowadays with xquery there is no reason to use xslt anymore xquery is much nicer

solution,sense
a solution in xslt would work too but if you are not already using xslt then using xquery makes more sense here i guess

flwr,syntax,intuitive,sql,back-ground,imo,powerful,input
the flwr syntax of xquery is quite intuitive if you have an sql back-ground imo xslt is the more powerful language when dealing with one input one output situations especially if the output will not be xml

amenable,static,analysis,dynamic,template
xquery is more amenable to static analysis than xslt because it lacks the very dynamic template despatch mechanism

popular,xpath,basis
probably more popular than xquery is xpath which is the basis of xslt transform

typing,feature
unless you are using the static typing feature xquery is no more strongly typed than xslt

namespace,useful,default,output,better
setting the xhtml namespace as the default namespace might be useful though sadly in xquery this also makes it the default namespace for the output - xslt does this better
