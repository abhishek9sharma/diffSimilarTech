better, 1-sin, function, ---------------------------------------------------

sincos,better,cos,approach,faster
the jni sincos is better than computing sin and cos but the sqrt approach is still faster

cos,cheaper,1-sin
if i want to calculate a sin and a cos is it cheaper to calculate a sin and a cos or calculate a sin then a sqrt 1-sin 2 to get the cos

function,constexpr,cos,trickier
an two for a function like sqrt i could probably write my own constexpr but something like sin or cos would be trickier so is there away around it

others---------------------------------------------------

faster
it s like asking whether sin is faster than sqrt
