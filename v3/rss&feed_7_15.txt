better, job, facebook, ---------------------------------------------------

better,twitter,engator,facebook
better than twitter feed is engator - rss to twitter and facebook

google,services,better,job,atom
google s services that generate feed generally do a better job at producing atom rather than rss

api, search, ideal, ---------------------------------------------------

api,search,ideal
if necessary i am willing to use the twitter api directly to do the search instead of using rss but for my purposes using a feed is more ideal

google,api
google does this because their feed api can parse more than rss

easier, fwiw, faster, ---------------------------------------------------

atom,easier,rsssyndication
i ve been working with rss quite a bit and have found that atom feed are typically easier to parse using the rsssyndication class

atom,faster,fwiw
the atom feed option seems to load faster than the rss one fwiw

others---------------------------------------------------

informations,xml,easier,html,page,atom,extract,tags
those are well-known formats and extracting informations from such xml feed would be much easier than getting it from an html page with rss atom you ll just have to parse the xml feed and extract the tags that contain informations that interest you

process,data,image,description
i m using php to process rss data however often feed have more than image in the description

specification,atom,value,internationalization,content,things,modern,reader
the specification of atom feed offers more value than the rss one with internationalization content types and other things and every modern feed reader supports it

first,wordpress,widget,external,websites,customised,.net,system.net.webclient,fetch,result,xmlreader,syndicationfeed
your first option might be to search for a wordpress rss widget for external websites alternatively if you want to be more customised about how you retrieve the rss then one way if your using .net is to use system.net.webclient and system.web.webrequest fetch and cache the result and then you can parse the feed using xmlreader syndicationfeed classes

real,world,complex,parser
from experience i ve found real world feed are often more complex than the rss parser can handle

compatibility,durability,things,help
you d gain compatibility and durability because rss is more defined things will change less but if the feed doesn t include what you need it won t help you

garbled,double-encoded,xml,html
that will result in your feed looking even more garbled than it already does because the php will be double-encoded once for the rss xml and again for the html contained in the rss xml

campaign
as you noticed yoou cannot create an rss campaign feeded by more than oone feed

articles,blog,atom,easier,info
and as an aside if you re trying to get the list of articles on your blog reading the rss or atom feed might be easier though i suppose it might not have all the info you need
