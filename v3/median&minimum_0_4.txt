std,vector,first,element,last,greater
i want to repeatedly rearrange an array or std vector so that the minimum is the first element the maximum is the last element and would be the median elements before the median is less than median elements after the median would be greater

possible,values,q1,q2,q3,maximum
but i can only see 5 possible values not 7 or is there more than minimum q1 q2 median q3 maximum to a boxplot

maximum,hi,m+1,smaller,lo
there are at least n m+1 2 elements no larger than the maximum hi of these median and at least n m+1 2 no smaller than the minimum lo

number,higher,new
if the number is higher than the median the median is the new minimum
