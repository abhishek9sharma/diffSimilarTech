nice,straightforward,signature,uses,factory,functions,complicated
the simplest thing is probably to define b with a nice straightforward initializer with the same signature as a uses and then additional factory functions defined as class-method to do the more complicated scenarios

static,cleaner,redundant,objects
static class-method often allow cleaner code and save you from initializer redundant objects
