faster,concatenation
in vb6 at least so i assume it s true in vba replace is faster than concatenation

superset,subset,functionality
vba is in fact a superset of vb6 not a subset -- vba has more functionality built in than vb6 itself

vbide,methods,vb,projects,version
fortunately the vbide for vb6 has more classes and methods for working with vb projects than the vba version of vbide

better,results,exact,thing
you can often get better results by searching vb6 which is almost the exact same thing as vba

whole
vba being a whole lot less than vb6
