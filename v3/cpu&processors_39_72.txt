core, computer, intel, ---------------------------------------------------

intel,amd,cheaper,faster
the intel amd processors are much cheaper and faster than what you can get with these until they go in every cpu everywhere

single,core,size,smaller,word,32bit,int
in general when used on single processors single core machine this should be sufficient assuming int size same or smaller than cpu word like 32bit int on 32bit cpu

superscalar,architecture,form,parallelism,single,cant
i have read a superscalar cpu architecture implements a form of parallelism called instruction level parallelism within a single processors superscalar cant use more than one processors

core,i3-2120,cpus
processors intel core i3-2120 cpu 3.30ghz 4 cpus

refers,computer,logical,core,multiple
multicore refers to a computer or processors that has more than one logical cpu core and that can execute multiple instructions at the same time.

internal,electronics,modern,faster,direct
for complicated reasons having to do with the internal electronics of the cpu for most modern processors it is faster to perform a direct branch where the destination address is encoded in the instruction than an indirect branch where the address is computed at runtime

premium,service,core,i5-2410m,ghz
windows 7 home premium service pack 1 processors intel core i5-2410m cpu 2.30 ghz 2.30ghz

rule,thumb,count,threads,physical,cores,chip,logical,technology,core
the rule of thumb is that if a cpu is given more than double the count of actively running threads as it has execution units these are the physical cores on a cpu chip and logical processors like hyperthreading technology that splits one core into two then the os will spend more time scheduling threads and switching between them cache-thrashing than it will spend actually running the threads

multicore,single,core,capable,units,architecture
multicore means that a single cpu can have more than one core capable of executing tasks and has all execution units connected in some way depending on the architecture of the processors

slower,sparc,modern,intel
the cpu is indeed slower on sparc 1.2ghz and as answered by one of the sun s engineers t2 is usualy 3 times slower for single-threaded application than modern intel processors

quad,core,threadpoolexecutor,callables
i have a quad core processors and the threadpoolexecutor is set to 4 core threads but when i submit my callables hundred or so to the threadpoolexecutor java never uses more than 25 cpu

core,speed,total
should i just look for more than one cpu core and how do i detect that or maybe the processors speed or total system memory

number,logical,computer,advantage,cannot
i have read that the number of threads cannot be more than the number of logical processors your computer has or at least there is no advantage to be gained since your cpu cannot handle more

magnitude,slower,perspective
since these are typically orders of magnitude slower than the processors from the cpu s perspective this takes forever

core,i5-2500k,sandy,bridge
processors intel core i5-2500k cpu 3.30ghz sandy bridge processorcount 4

core,i7-4790,x
processors intel core i7-4790 cpu 3.60ghz x 8

core,i5-5300u
processors intel core i5-5300u cpu 2.30ghz 2.30ghz

core,i7-4770hq,haswell,processorcount
processors intel core i7-4770hq cpu 2.20ghz haswell processorcount 2

core,i5-4440,x
processors intel core i5-4440 cpu 3.10ghz x 4

core,intel,physical,cores,logical
a quad core intel cpu s with hyperthreading enabled has 4 physical cores yet 8 logical processors hyperthreading creates 4 more logical processors

multicore,computer,logical,core,multiple
multicore refers to a computer or processors that has more than one logical cpu core and that can physically execute multiple instructions at the same time

core,i7-3930k
processors intel core i7-3930k cpu 3.20ghz

core,i5-4440,speed,matters
processors intel core i5-4440 cpu 3.10ghz that s to mention if speed matters

core,i7-6700hq
processors intel core i7-6700hq cpu 2.60ghz

core,i3-4005u
processors intel core i3-4005u cpu 1.70ghz 1.70ghz

memory, data, ram, ---------------------------------------------------

byte,buses,efficient,data,memory,ram
having data structures that start on 4 byte word alignment on cpus with 4 byte buses and processors is far more efficient when moving data around memory and between ram and the cpu

cache,data,transfer,time,closer,ram
the point of this cache is to store data that the cpu is using quite regularly to speed up transfer time since the cpu cache is physically closer to the processors then ram is

compilers,bits,precision,register,memory
this is because some compilers or processors will use more bits of precision in a cpu register than in memory msvc has 3 different floating-point behavior options for example

different, mode, contention, ---------------------------------------------------

mode,different,latest,functions
real mode seem to be different from cpu to cpu maybe latest processors provide more functions to this mode

fewer,threads,cores
the application has far fewer threads than the cpu has processors cores

pages,network,threads,number,cores,benificial
since downloading web pages is network bound rather than cpu bound using more threads than my number of processors cores is very benificial since most of the time in each thread is spent waiting for the network to catch up

different,cores,time
if that processors has more than one cpu can the interrupts run on different cpu cores at the same time

threads,different,cores,numa,systems,machines,sockets,separate
binding threads to cores prevents the operating system from moving around threads between different processors cores which speeds up the executing especially on numa systems machines with more than one cpu sockets and separate memory controller in each socket where data locality is very important

contention,tasks,cores,slowdowns
given that you re seeing extra tasks causing a slowdown you likely either have resource contention via locking or your tasks are cpu bound and having more tasks than processors cores will cause slowdowns

system, resources, execution, ---------------------------------------------------

single,effective,system,gpu
as soon as you go beyond single processors it s much more effective to add another cpu or two to system than to struggle with gpu calculations

resources,process,io,sub,system
the operating system will give your program all the resources it needs the reason your process is not consuming all the cpu is probably because it s waiting for the io sub system more than the processors

system,cores,smp-enabled,affinity,processes,guarantee
on a system with more than one processors or processors cores you can normally assuming you do have a smp-enabled system cpu affinity doesn t prevent it expect those two processes to use both processors but you do not strictly have a guarantee

cores,logical,architecture,multithreaded,execution,time,scheduling
with current hardware at about twice the number of active threads as execution units cores ht logical processors however the architecture handles multithreaded execution your cpu starts spending more time scheduling thread execution and managing thread states than it is actually executing the threaded instructions

small,multi-thread,time,concurrency,resources,threads
the difference you notice is very small but i think the multi-thread processors is spending more time because the concurrency for the cpu resources between the threads

others---------------------------------------------------

modern,lower,power,usage,noise,fan
on a relatively modern cpu this will also cause the processors to enter a lower power state and should have noticeable effect power usage and the noise generated by the cpu fan

addition,embedded,architecture,cheaper,mainstream,product,life
one addition for embedded cpu architecture they have to be usually cheaper than mainstream processors so that they do not raise the product s life considerably

developer,costs,difficult,user-space,transistor,count
not only is it more expensive in terms of developer costs designing a cpu is vastly more difficult than writing user-space assembly code but it would increase the transistor count of the processors

rise,frequency,powerful
rise cpu frequency set more powerful processors s

longer,window,better
some fancy compilers understand the un interrelatedness of instructions to a limited extent and will automatically interleave instruction flows probably over a longer window than the cpu sees to better utilise the processors

cycles,great,performance,modern,instruction,multiple
however cpu cycles aren t a great way to measure performance with modern processors which run more than one instruction at once pipelining have multiple layers of cache etc

ubuntu,32-bit,settings,system,slider,screenshot
i would like to use more than one cpu to run ubuntu 14.04 32-bit in virtualbox but when i stop the machine and go in settings - system - processors the processors s slider is grayed out as you can see in the screenshot image

size,greater,cache,pieces,main
for if your solving algorithm size is greater than the processors cache size the cpu must retrieve pieces of code from main memory or l2 cache which is a slower operation

notice,cache,important,today
notice also the the cpu cache is much more important than processors registers today

closest,heart,a.k.a,brain,higher,chain
since registers are closest to the heart of the cpu a.k.a the brain of your processors they are higher up in the chain and ofcourse operations performed directly on registers take the least amount of clock cycles

method,faster,branch,prediction,command,smarter,new
so whether or not method 5 or 6 is faster depends on the cpu i can only surmise this is because the branch prediction in the command processors of the cpu is smarter on the new processors but i m not really sure

system,monitor,program,terminal,loop,maximum,usage,longer,time,average,higher
i find using system monitor that consistently 100 of one cpu is used when i run the program directly in terminal whereas when i run it in bash in a loop a maximum of 60 of cpu usage is recorded and seems to be linked to the longer completion time although the average cpu usage is higher over the 4 processors

loadbalancing,physical,task,scheduler,second
passive loadbalancing if a physical cpu is running more than one task the scheduler will attempt to run any new tasks on a second physical processors

x86,family,long,1970s,architecture,simpler
now the x86 family of processors go back a long way to the 1970s when cpu architecture was simpler

thread,fine,free,rich,limitation,pool
if the processors is loaded enough then my thread works fine but when the processors is more or less free i rich quickly my cpu limitation 50 and finally the pool terminates and needs to be recycled

use
how would i make python use only 7 of the processors to free up more cpu

task,multi,performance,calculations
if a task is cpu bound calcuating something making it multi threaded will only improve performance if you have more than one processors to run the calculations

first,data,memory,second,implicit,lock,cores,value,ptr
the lock or on the first case makes sure that the data has been updated before any other cpu can read any more memory in the second case the xchg instruction has an implicit lock so all other processors cores will have to release their value of ptr before your processors can update the value

cannot,use,physical,core--
to the operating system a single thread which i assume is what you mean by java process essentially cannot use cpu on more than one processors which may or may not mean a physical core-- see below simultaneously

advantage,stuff,power,thread
yes i know that browsers can take advantage of it and that putting the other stuff on the other processors can provide more cpu power to the javascript thread but i have an app that is mostly raw javscript internal processing where the main thing that is going on is search and array manipulation

program,thread,necessary,definition,full,use,top,linux
that is enable to your program to use more at least than one thread more than one processors if necessary that is by definition capped at 1 single virtual core of full use thus 100 of cpu that you see on top on linux or equivalent in other system

time,cluster,shorter,big.little,transitions,lower,operating
because the time taken to migrate a cpu or a cluster is shorter than the dvfs change time and an order of magnitude shorter than the os evaluation period for dvfs changes big.little transitions will enable the processors to run at lower operating points more frequently and further be completely invisible to the user

opencl,multi,cores,portable,meaning,gpu,faster
is opencl just there to make multi processors cores just more portable meaning porting the code to either gpu or cpu or is opencl faster and more efficient

application,c#.now,affinity,application.i
i have created a window application in c#.now i want to set the cpu affinity for this application.i may have 2 processors 4 processors 8 processors or may be more than 8 processors

speeds,past,advent,multi-core
cpu speeds matter less than they did in the past thanks to the advent of multi-core processors

irq,context,tasklet
cannot sleep run atomically in soft irq context and are guaranteed to never run on more than one cpu of a given processors for a given tasklet

specific,stuff,raspberry,arm,cortex-a7,latest,raspian
if it needs to be more specific with processors and stuff let s just say this is for raspberry pi 2a 900mhz quad-core arm cortex-a7 cpu on the latest raspian os

current,chips,able,couple
many current processors chips incorporate more than one cpu and a cpu may itself be able to interleave a couple of threads

reg,virtual,things,multiple,higher,layers,present,today
vcpu reg are virtual cpu registers that exist on many processors that have things like multiple cores hyperthreading or other features that enable higher layers to believe that there is more than one cpu present when there isn t -- such as today s x86s

modern,built-in,virtualization,virtual,part,faster,execution
and in fact modern processors often have a built-in virtualization feature which even allows virtualization software such as virtualbox or vmware to run the instructions natively while the virtual part is done by the cpu itself allowing much faster execution speed of virtual machines.

newer,faster,ways,ones,available,amd,intel,specific,model
newer processors have other faster ways to do it and which ones are available depends on whether the cpu is from amd or intel and on the specific cpu model

xeon,r,e5-4610,v2,milions,increments,better
on a better machine 8 x intel r xeon r cpu e5-4610 v2 2.30ghz 256 gb ram much to my surprise i obtained an average 3 milions increments despite the fact that processors is much better

time,higher,exception,multi,environment
elapsed time is generally higher than cpu time with the exception of a multi processors environment
