better, function, use, ---------------------------------------------------

entire,animation,better,use,animations
instead initiate all the settimeout s you need for the entire animation at the same time with increasing delays in a loop and let them run their course or better yet use setinterval which is the better way of doing animations and how for instance jquery s animations work

better,idea,fight,longer
using settimeout for such purposes is better idea than setinterval as you don t have to clear them and they won t get crowded - if your fight takes longer than period then this won t run into next fight

view,div,better,requirement
i also faced the same problem and i fixed it by writing a new controller and a view for the div to be refreshed and then used setinterval actually settimeout worked better for my requirement

better,previous,ajax
but settimeout would be better than setinterval because with setinterval if your previous ajax request is not complete and you start another request there will have multiple requests which would sooner be problematic

function,single,timeout,appropriate
the function settimeout is intended for a single timeout so using setinterval would be a more appropriate option

better,task
setinterval is better than settimeout for this task

scheduling,approach,better
so for scheduling purposes i suggest you to use the setinterval approach while the settimeout approach is better for delayed execution and asynchronous work

function,multiple,functions,better
i thought about using the setinterval function instead but because i am dealing with multiple functions i thought settimeout would be better

function,chrono,interval
settimeout evaluates your function once setinterval is more suited to call your chrono at specified interval

animations,easier,importantly.
you can use setinterval instead but for most animations settimeout is easier to control and more importantly.

places,better
this is also one of the few places i think you d be better off with setinterval rather than settimeout

calls,better,single,call
in general repeated calls to settimeout are better than a single call to setinterval for a few reasons

better,screwy,ways
using settimeout is considered better than setinterval because of the screwy ways that js s event loop works

timer,better,method,use
the above delta timer is better than setinterval method 1 makes use of settimeout method 2 but also corrects itself starts the timer using a function method 3 and doesn t pollute the scope with a special clockstart function method 4

better,situation,infinite,loop
also i think you d be better off with setinterval in this situation instead of using an infinite settimeout loop

function,use,program,second,pragragh
to make it infinite loop you have to wrap all these code inside a function and use only one setinterval because using more than one can damage your program and use a settimeout to delay the second pragragh bb class changes this is the function that i came up with

better
also setinterval is often better replaced by settimeout

better
setinterval would be the better way than settimeout

lines,array,better,animations
if so then you can just pop lines off the array using settimeout which is better than setinterval for most animations

better,secs,time,job
settimeout is better than setinterval here because setinterval will start at every 5 secs but settimeout will start once each time your job is done and wait for 5 seconds which will make your script adaptive to server response timings

better,approach,round,trip
also settimeout is a better approach than setinterval as you explicitly reset it on each round trip

better,solution,new,previous
it uses settimeout however settimeout is a better solution than setinterval because it will only queue a new one if the previous one is complete

use,timer,several,timers
the use of one settimeout timer is more preferably than several setinterval timers

countdown,timers,things
setinterval is much more suited for countdown timers and things you need to run continually since settimeout only runs once and you need to keep on calling it

better
instead of a setinterval here settimeout will work far better

for-loop,better
instead of using a for-loop and settimeout would setinterval work better for what you need

better,job
we could still do this with settimeout but setinterval is better suited for this job

safer
i think using settimeout is safer than setinterval

better,function,repeat
i understand from searching on so that setinterval is a better way to approach this that settimeout which i was using initially but i haven t figured out how to specify that the function needs to repeat

need, useful, simpler, ---------------------------------------------------

simpler,need,clearinterval
as for me settimeout is simpler than setinterval in this case as you won t need to clearinterval in the end of the array

relevant,first,method
settimeout is more relevant than setinterval since the first method just waits for a delay and executes a logic whereas the second function is meant for repeating a logic on periodic intervals

routine,second,useful
now a routine to initiate once per second - settimeout is usually more useful than setinterval

useful,need
setinterval is more useful than settimeout here as it recurs automatically and you don t need to keep setting it

little, performance, statement, ---------------------------------------------------

shure,statement,little,performance
and im not shure about this statement javascript likes settimeout more than setinterval which gives a little performance boost

little,cleaner,calls
i find setinterval is a little cleaner than chaining settimeout calls

look, tasks, appropriate, ---------------------------------------------------

look,appropriate
also i advise you to take a look at javascript s setinterval since it is more appropriate than settimeout for what you want to do

appropriate,tasks
i ve replaced settimeout with setinterval which is more appropriate for repeated tasks

others---------------------------------------------------

efficient,schedules,alarm,particular,time,processor,cycles
keep in mind that using setinterval is less efficient for this case then using settimeout which doesn t require comparing times at all as it schedules the alarm to occur at a particular time as setinterval will use more processor cycles to both schedule a check and then to compare the times

readable,eyes,approach,fine
using setinterval may be more readable to some eyes but i think the settimeout approach you have is fine

comment,tree,appropriate,noticeable
this in effect would traverse the comment tree linearly and would allow the setinterval or probably settimeout would be more appropriate to have a noticeable affect

bigger,priority
it seems that settimeout has bigger priority than setinterval which could be delayed

sounds,sync,accurate
it works super well initially but over the course of about a minute the sounds become noticeably out of sync as i ve read happens with setinterval i ve read that settimeout can be more consistently accurate

tabs,chrome,1000ms
what i observed on inactive tabs in chrome all your settimeout must be the same for setinterval waiting less than 1000ms are rounded to 1000ms

cpu,resources,intensive
i read that settimeout is less cpu resources intensive than setinterval

right,efficient,memory
you made the right choice using setinterval instead of settimeout here as in this case settimeout would have been less efficient with memory resources

logic,points,proper,solution,possibility,progress,bar
logic points that settimeout would be more proper solution for spawning and such but setinterval gives me possibility of providing progress bar while settimeout does not

aesthetic,experience,requestanimationframe
also in my experience at least settimeout offers a much more aesthetic experience than setinterval or requestanimationframe

solution,bigger,delay,line,script
my solution was to increase the settimeout to create a bigger delay before the next part of the script commenced but also to add an additional clearinterval as the top line of the script running within the setinterval

variation,cross-browser,secure
a variation that uses settimeout rather than setinterval and uses the more cross-browser secure document.location.reload true

control,timing
setinterval vs settimeout i used settimeout instead of setinterval which gives more control over timing

lieu,cumbersome,cycle
settimeout is used in lieu of setinterval which is more cumbersome when it comes to killing the cycle
