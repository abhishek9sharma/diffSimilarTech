gin,index,expensive,equivalent,faster,seq,use
i admit that gin index on hstore is much more expensive than its equivalent for jsonb but even then it is faster to just do seq scan on hstore than use index on jsonb

union,functions,arrays,text,bulk,updates,better
also assuming someone figures out the difference union functions for jsonb arrays or text arrays would the bulk updates for hstore perform significantly better

json,fields,json-encodable,pairs,faster,compact
json jsonb fields support any json-encodable data type not just key value pairs but also tend to be faster and for jsonb more compact than hstore
