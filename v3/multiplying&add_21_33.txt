slower, years, ---------------------------------------------------

years,slower
as of a few years ago multiplying was 3x slower than add

slower
its the multiplying that historically was slower than the add

lower, resolutions, instructions, ---------------------------------------------------

integer,instructions,lower,latency
integer add subtract compare instructions but not multiplying are also lower latency than their fp counterparts

higher,lower,resolutions
you can add higher and lower resolutions by multiplying or dividing them by 2

better, bit-shifted, sub, ---------------------------------------------------

better,couple,bit-shifted
still while it might be better than multiplying by say 17 16+1 or 12 8+4 as they only add in a couple bit-shifted copies of the original value instead of five it s a very weak hash compared to hash functions that do more than a single running multiplication and i ll illustrate that using some statistical analysis.

sub,cheaper,better,throughput
add sub are cheaper than multiplying better throughput and lower latency

precedence, divide, higher, ---------------------------------------------------

someone,behaviour,operator,higher,precedence
can someone explain this behaviour multiplying operator has higher precedence than add operator

pow,evaluator,higher,precedence,divide
i would like to add the pow in my evaluator with an higher precedence than multiplying and divide

divide,higher,precedence
multiplying and divide have higher precedence than add and subtract

sophisticated,approach,divide
a slightly more sophisticated approach with add subtract multiplying divide

extra,braces,higher,precedence,percentage,discounts
with extra braces because multiplying has a higher precedence than add - assuming these are both percentage discounts

precedence,left-to-right,instruction,level
then i think it would be the problem of precedence in most case they are left-to-right and i think multiplying would be calculated first because in c multiplying is more prior than add instruction by one level

higher,precedence,example,john
to give multiplying and divide higher precedence than add and subtract you can do something like this example adapted from john levine lex yacc 2 e 1992

pow,evaluator,higher,precedence,divide
moreover i would like to add the pow in my evaluator with an higher precedence than multiplying and divide

exprbinopmul,precedence,higher,proper,consideration
in the above example the instance of exprbinopadd is a child of the instance of exprbinopmul although precedence of multiplying is higher than precedence of add which results from the proper consideration of the parentheses

particular,chunk,divide,modulo,time,greater
but my guess would be that in this particular chunk of code multiplying divide and modulo all take roughly the same amount of time and that time is greater than add or subtract

faster, cycles, multiplication, ---------------------------------------------------

jit,multiplication,opcodes,relationship,cycles,faster,addition
in the remote case those operations are not simplified assuming that there is a jit that maps the multiplication and add opcodes in a 1 1 relationship to their cpu instruction counterparts in most modern architectures all integer arithmetic operations usually take the same number of cycles so it will be faster multiplying once than add four times just checked it addition is still slightly faster than multiplication 1 clock vs 3 clocks so it still pays using a multiplication here

faster,clock,cycles,verses,particular,cpu
however multiplying is faster than adding even though less clock cycles are used to add verses multiplying according to what my particular cpu s datasheet says about the instructions being used

simple,shift,faster,multiplication,loop,cost,check
while it is true that a simple shift or add is often faster than a multiplication but not always Ã¢ multiplication are faster than you might think the only way you could use it here inside the loop is if you first checked to see that you were supposed to be multiplying by 2 and the cost of doing that check more specifically the cost of making the decision as a result of that check is far more costly than a simple integer multiplication

operation,clock,cycles,processors
the multiplying operation uses more clock cycles than the add on many processors

faster,mul,general,values,loop,operations
add is faster than mul but if you want to multiplying two general values mul is far faster than any loop iterating add operations

others---------------------------------------------------

g,complex,user,number
however lets say i want g to do something more complex than multiplying by 2 like ask the user for a number and add that like so

fast,multiplier,order,slower,normal,hardware
on a cpu with a fast multiplier multiplying may only be on the order of 4 times slower than add but on normal hardware it s 16-32 times slower for a 32 bit operation

odd,larger
the pattern is if the integer is even divide it by 2 if the integer is odd and larger than 1 multiplying it by 3 and add 1

time,addition,step
functionally a multiplying will always take more time than an add because it combines a true multiplying along with a true addition step

expensive,modern,computers
multiplying is still somewhat more expensive than add on modern computers and compilers go to some effort to replace them with one or two shifts+add instructions

runtime,multiplication,canbe,instruction,support,processors,risc,complex,operations,small
if 50 is replaced by x a value known only at runtime there will be a multiplication before the add the multiplication canbe optimised into a faster operation if the multiplicand is simple enough as one instruction because there is support to multiplying by 1 2 4 8 and 16 - at least in some processors and even risc processors multiplication is often more complex than a few add and shift operations - small numbers are often very easy to deal with this way but 575 or 13412 may not be so easy to convert to a small number of simple operations so a proper multiplication will be needed

horizontal,pairs,results,wider
they add horizontal pairs of multiplying results producing wider elements


like this you can add subtract multiplying and divide more easily


where multiplying binds more tightly than add

line,divide,result,multiplication,zeros,variable
so the bottom line is after every divide do the multiplying the 5 with 5 and if the result of multiplication is less than the equals to n then divide the n with result and add the zeros counter variable

fp,throughput,lower,fma,intel,skylake
for example fp add throughput is lower than fma or multiplying on intel before skylake 1 vector per clock instead of 2

x
if x is less than 1 add -1 to e and multiplying x by 2
