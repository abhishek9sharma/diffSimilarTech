errors, better, base, ---------------------------------------------------

faster,errors,data
fread performs faster and more efficiently than read.table but read.table produces less no errors on the same data set

read_csv,data.table,faster,base
for reading large csv files you should either use readr read_csv or data.table fread as both are much faster than base read.table

fast,faster,read.csv,large
fread ... is extremely fast 10 - 100 times faster than read.table ... or read.csv ... for large datasets

data.table,better,standard
for this data.table fread would be better than the standard read.table

conventional,faster,function
instead of the conventional read.table i feel fread is a faster function

others---------------------------------------------------

try,check,function,faster
you might want to give the data.table package a try check out the fread function which is much faster than read.table

version,read.csv,take,time,optimisation,longer
interestingly for 1 million rows per file the optimised version of read.csv and read.table take 422 and 430 more time than fread whilst without optimisation this leaps to around 1500 and 1005 longer
