disclaimer, idiomatic, ---------------------------------------------------

disclaimer,idiomatic
disclaimer all this would be needed just to throw an illegalargumentexception which is less idiomatic than a nullpointerexception

idiomatic
arguably throwing a nullpointerexception would be more idiomatic than throwing an illegalargumentexception though

others---------------------------------------------------

mind,specific,argument,method
in my mind illegalargumentexception seems more specific than using a nullpointerexception since it s telling me that the problem was with an argument i passed to the method and not with a value that may have been generated while performing the method

sense,string,blank
also throwing illegalargumentexception makes more sense instead of nullpointerexception when string has blank empty or null values

longer,filepath
decoding nullpointerexception is going to take a bit longer than illegalargumentexception filepath must be supplied or whatever

implementations,methods,argument,null,wrong,implementation,sense
there are some instances of implementations that i have seen for some methods that throw nullpointerexception if argument is null but that is wrong implementation in those cases illegalargumentexception makes much more sense

communicative
as others have said illegalargumentexception is an option but i think nullpointerexception is more communicative

abstraction,level,better
since it s an exported method clients should get an exception on their abstraction level so illegalargumentexception is better than nullpointerexception

use,line
notice my use of illegalargumentexception instead of nullpointerexception - the illegalargumentexception is more in line with what you re hoping to achieve
