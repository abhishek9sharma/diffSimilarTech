solution,jsf,container,powerful
in my opinion this is a more elegant solution than jsf and i think tapestry s ioc container makes it more powerful than wicket

goal,static,fullest,extent,lines
wicket s goal is to support static typing to the fullest extent whereas tapestry is more about saving lines of code
