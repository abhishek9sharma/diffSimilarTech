lookups, values, wirelessapdata, ---------------------------------------------------

faster,values
qhash is faster but qmap values are sorted by key if you iterate through them

faster,lookups
qhash provides faster lookups than qmap

faster,wirelessapdata
also i have changed the qmap to qhash to make it faster and wirelessapdata is just a struct

others---------------------------------------------------

dimension,use,efficient
also with this method you could use different container for different dimensions like if you need one dimension to be sorted use qmap which is sorted by key for that and qhash which is more efficient for the dimension which doesn t need sorting

reasonable,neox
using qmap instead of qhash seems more reasonable as neox recommended on his comment
