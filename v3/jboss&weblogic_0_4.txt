glassfish,better,spring,context,direct,mq
in weblogic and glassfish you ll be better inspired by deploying the native ibm jca resource adapter and creating jndi resources then referenced in the spring context as above in jboss a direct mq client bean declaration suits best as below

tomcat,application,xif.createxmlstreamreader,source
the problem i am facing is that in jboss tomcat it works fine.but as soon as i move my application to weblogic i get xif.createxmlstreamreader source

application,soap,call,restrictive
i am running an application on jboss 7 and weblogic 12 when i make a soap call on weblogic is more restrictive than jboss

self-sufficient,tomcat,resource,intensive,costs,money
if your application is self-sufficient i would recommend going for tomcat as jboss is much more resource intensive as well as weblogic moreover weblogic costs some money
