wx,sort,thing,better,solution
matplotlib wx will work but if you are going to be doing more of this sort of thing i found that chaco was a better solution for interaction

module,gnuplot,fit
i m not sure if i m approaching this the right way or if i should be looking at another graphing module but i ve looked at gnuplot and chaco and i felt that matplotlib was more fit for my problem

enthought-dev,faster
enthought-dev is chaco faster than matplotlib
