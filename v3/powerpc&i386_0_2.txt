cxxflags,-arch,wrapper,universal
to facilitate building of universal binaries we ve modified the cflags and cxxflags to include -arch i386 -arch powerpc when compiling wrapper code ogre3d itself already seems to be an universal binary

dyld,stub,faster,equivalent,extra
on i386 the dyld stub is much faster than the powerpc equivalent so we didn√¢ t bother doing extra work to bypass it
