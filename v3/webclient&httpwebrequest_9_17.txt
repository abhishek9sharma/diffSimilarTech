slower, higher, milliseconds, ---------------------------------------------------

order,milliseconds,slower
using webclient is potentially slightly on the order of a few milliseconds slower than using httpwebrequest directly

higher,class,slower
because webclient is higher class of httpwebrequest and its slower

level, lower, bit, ---------------------------------------------------

httpwebresponse,little,bit,lower,level
httpwebresponse and httpwebrequest are a little bit lower level than webclient

response,lower,level,accomplish
if httpwebrequest response are lower level then webclient what can i accomplish with httpwebrequest response that i cannot accomplish with webclient

easier, control, powerful, ---------------------------------------------------

easier,flexible,callback
while webclient may appear to be easier to use than httpwebrequest it is less flexible and will automatically perform it s callback on the ui thread and if you re downloading files in the background you almost certainly don t want this

easier,powerful,control
webclient is easier but httpwebrequest is more powerful and allows for more control

use, robust, keepalive, ---------------------------------------------------

use,robust
use httpwebrequest instead of webclient it s just more robust

use,convenient,keepalive
use httpwebrequest instead of webclient it s slightly less convenient but not by very much and set the keepalive property to false

others---------------------------------------------------

simpler,order,cookiecontainer,protected,getwebrequest
you can also use webclient which is much simpler than httpwebrequest but in order to set a cookiecontainer you ll need to derive from webclient and override the protected getwebrequest method


as far as i understood webclient inherits httpwebrequest providing more simply way to code

reliable
would using webclient be more reliable or is it the same as using httpwebrequest -something like below

better
so simply httpwebrequest is better option then webclient

issue,httpwebresponse,reasonable,timeout
if that is the issue you ll probably need to refactor to use the httpwebrequest and httpwebresponse classes instead on webclient and configure a more reasonable timeout

class,idiomatic,hand,rolling
also i think the webclient class is more idiomatic these days than hand rolling httpwebrequest

simpler,interface,care,reading
webclient has a much simpler interface than httpwebrequest and takes care of reading and writing from the streams for you

mvc,limitations,options,fine
i recently just finished a web app using asp.net mvc 4.0 and i ran into some limitations while using webclient instead i opted for httpwebrequest which gave me more options to fine tune my requests

httpwebresponse
i d rather use webclient because it requires less code than httpwebrequest httpwebresponse
