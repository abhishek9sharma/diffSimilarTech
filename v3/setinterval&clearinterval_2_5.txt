method, simpler, cleaner, ---------------------------------------------------

method,simpler
i find this method simpler than using clearinterval to pause and setinterval again to restart

cleaner
this is perhaps a bit cleaner with a setinterval instead of a clearinterval

others---------------------------------------------------

script,additional,top,line
my solution was to increase the settimeout to create a bigger delay before the next part of the script commenced but also to add an additional clearinterval as the top line of the script running within the setinterval

straightforward
but with setinterval combined with clearinterval it is more straightforward

settimeout,simpler,need,end,array
as for me settimeout is simpler than setinterval in this case as you won t need to clearinterval in the end of the array
