actual,trickier,business,fat,ext3,nfs,cifs
actual mounting of filesystems is trickier business and really depends on what you are mounting - ntfs fat ext3 xfs nfs cifs webdav etc etc

mature,modern,older,reliable
ext4 is a reasonably mature modern filesystems while xfs is older but still quite reliable

prior,experience,simpler,ones,ntfs,ext2,job
although i myself have prior experience in implementing filesystems much simpler ones than ntfs xfs or ext2 i would not tackle this job

suitable
a filesystems such as xfs is more suitable for this

harder,good,behaviour,comparison,user,careful
some filesystems such as xfs try harder to provide good aio behaviour in comparison other filesystems but even there a user still has to be very careful as to avoid operations that will trigger synchrony
