better,api,protocol,simpler
i suggest that you to move jmock which has a better api or even to mockito whose protocol is even simpler

comments,friendlier
much as i used to love jmock i have to agree with the comments that mockito is far friendlier to use

record,today,complex,initial,learning
for the record jmock as of today supports more complex scenarios than mockito that s why the initial learning curve is steeper
