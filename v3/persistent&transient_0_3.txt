intuition,properties,overhead,database,things
my intuition is that transient properties would incurr less overhead than persistent properties because they do not need to be persistent and read from the database so converting them to persistent properties will likely only make things slightly worse

property,sectionidentifier,time.i,new,next,sectionid
first i have a transient property called sectionidentifier .this could be now next and past depend on the current time.i added a new persistent property next to this transient called sectionid

data,memory
memcache data lives in memory and isn t persistent so is for more transient data
