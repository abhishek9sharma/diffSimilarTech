general,testing,well-established,product,tests,bdd
for general testing phpunit is a more well-established product while behat is focussed on tests written using bdd methodology behaviour driven design

bdd,features,style

titles,separated,appropriate,testing,solutions,selenium
i think you should extract logic of titles to separated classes and then test it by phpunit or use more appropriate testing solutions like behat or selenium
