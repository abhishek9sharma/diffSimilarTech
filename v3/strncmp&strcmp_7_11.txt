bit, note, strings, ---------------------------------------------------

approach,safer
but even in that approach i always prefer to use the safer strncmp than strcmp

little,bit,safer,comparisons
strncmp is a little bit safer than strcmp because you specify how many comparisons will be made at most

note,safer
note strncmp is safer than strcmp

words,safer,slower
in few words strncmp is safer then strcmp but it is slower too

strings,safer
you should use strncmp to compare your strings it s safer than strcmp

look,safer,version
also have a look at strncmp which is safer version of strcmp

others---------------------------------------------------

slower,pre-calculated,string,length,information
is strcmp slower than strncmp as one can give pre-calculated string length to it but strcmp does not receive such information

safer,character,arrays,3rd,argument,certain
the only case where strncmp would be safer than strcmp is when you re comparing two character arrays as strings you re certain that both arrays are at least n bytes long the 3rd argument passed to strncmp and you re not certain that both arrays contain strings contain a 0 null character terminator

secure
strncmp is more secure than strcmp

note,functions,memcmp,similar,safer
note also the functions strncmp and memcmp which are similar to strcmp but are safer

advantage,time,prefix,string
i could see only one advantage that strncmp will take slightly less time to execute than strcmp as we will always compare prefix of string to comapre rather than entire string
