simpler, script, options, ---------------------------------------------------

simpler,format,xml,options,nested
ini is really a much simpler format than xml if you have less than fifty config options and they are not nested

script,faster,xml,solutions
being php parseing it is nearly eg the file needs to be opened closed etc as fast as having the code at the top of each script and much faster than ini and xml config solutions

others---------------------------------------------------

similar,simpler,plain,text
it is similar to incron however config uses a simpler to read ini file instead of a plain text file

manual,better
if you intend manual config it s probably better to choose something else for example ini

todays,interest,json,logical,mind
i like that ini is more for config purposes but with todays interest in json it seems more logical for the config be designed with json in mind

spring,powerful,shiro,users,full
because spring s xml config is slightly more powerful than shiro s ini spring users are encouraged to use full spring config instead of shiro ini

arrays,complex,faster,files
since json can store arrays i can create quite complex config with it and it parses faster than ini files

anyone,suggestion,better,files
does anyone have a suggestion on how we could use an ini or have a better suggestion for creating build config files

fan,xml,yaml,json,friendly
personally i am not a big fan of xml config files yaml json and ini being seen as more friendly
