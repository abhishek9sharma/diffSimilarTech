command,line,needs,avrdude,complete,better
opted to use arduino from command line because it suited my needs so far i know avrdude and avr-gcc is a more complete or better way to compile upload from command line correct me if i m wrong

answer,assumptions,ide,closer
edit my original answer made some assumptions that arduino ide was closer to avr-gcc than it actually was
