thread, second, message, ---------------------------------------------------

main,thread,second,calculation,longer
i start the calculation in a new thread join it to the main thread with a timeout set to say 1 second but the main thread still keeps on waiting for the calculation to terminate which takes significantly longer than 1 second

computation,longer,worker,thread,error,message
if the file is huge and computation takes longer than the timeout the worker thread is terminate an error message is shown and no intraline difference is displayed for the file pair

window, requests, error, ---------------------------------------------------

requests,longer,error
if this works it will terminate requests taking longer than the timeout by raising a timeout error and such requests should generate transaction traces in new relic

requests,longer,window
you can also supply a timeout for these requests meaning any requests that run longer than the timeout window will be terminate after all

others---------------------------------------------------

processes,threads,sooner
the process spawns another processes and threads but all are terminate and joined much sooner than timeout

opening,closing,length,time,activity,connection
maybe its your grasp of english which is the problem but its the lifetime of the connection time between connection opening and closing you need to worry about more than the timeout length of time with no activity after which the connection will be terminate

runtimes,method,hard,longer,slow
i distinguish between long runtimes method terminate and hard timeout - the hard timeout are longer and meant to catch the case when code does not terminate at all as opposed to being slow

tcp,larger,connections,explicit,fin
for tcp the timeout can be much larger since tcp connections are usually terminate by an explicit fin fin-ack exchange

connection,client,lower,default,changes
but it seems barring any bugs in the code of the two that if your java connection client has a timeout set lower than the default heartbeat for couchdb continuous changes then the connection could get terminate by the java client

process,seconds
but the problem is that i need to terminate a process if it lasts more than a timeout 3 seconds
