32-bit, compilers, operations, ---------------------------------------------------

division,operation,slower
it is true that division and modulo a division operation is slower than addition

cheaper,operations,division,array
the addition is much cheaper than other operations like modulo and division and array access

division,costly,easy,underflow,operations
implementing multiplication and division might be more costly than you would like but at least addition is easy modulo protecting against over underflow and you claim to not need any operations so even better

division,remainder,operations,important,slower
then you can process any length number using very few division remainder modulo operations which is important because they are much slower than addition

larger,type,faster,division
performing addition on this slightly larger type will pretty much always be faster than doing division or modulo on the type itself

systems,64-bit,faster,32-bit,division
for example on most 32 bit systems 64-bit addition is faster than 32-bit division modulo

multiplication,division,slower,integer,subtraction
integer multiplication division and modulo are much slower than integer addition and subtraction

division,costly,hardware,compilers,slower
division and modulo are indeed costly hardware operations whatever you do this is more related to hardware architecture than to languages or compilers perhaps ten times slower than addition

divide-by-zero, priority, higher, ---------------------------------------------------

precedence,remainder,operator
because the string formatting operator shares precedence with the remainder or modulo which binds more tightly than the + addition operator

higher,precedence
the modulo has a higher precedence than addition

divide-by-zero,higher,precedence
modulo can also cause a divide-by-zero and it has a higher precedence than addition

multiplication,division,precedence,higher,subtraction
multiplication division and modulo have the same precedence and they all have higher precedence than addition and subtraction

multiplication,priority,higher,precedence
note parentheses are redundant as division and multiplication have the same priority and modulo has higher precedence over addition

higher,precedence,subtraction
and keep in mind that the modulo has a higher precedence than addition and subtraction

higher,operator,precedence
the modulo has a higher operator precedence than the addition operator therefore it will happen before the addition

others---------------------------------------------------

result,better,milliseconds,course
the result of the addition was better than the modulo the by 0.0070000 milliseconds over the course of 2 million or 200 000 iterations

weaker
is the modulo really weaker than the addition
