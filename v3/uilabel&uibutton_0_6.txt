text,title,slower
the uilabel text is shown correctly but the uibutton title update is slower

kind,link,appropriate
an uilabel could be used kind of showing a link but an uibutton might be more appropriate

test,cell
the problem i am having is when the test of the uilabel gets longer after pressing a uibutton - read more in the cell itself

solution,name,bottom-right
my solution is i create a uibutton name read more at bottom-right and below the uilabel

larger,next,line
if the uilabel is larger it will then wrap around the uibutton to the next line

subclass,firstviewcontroller
secondviewcontroller which is a subclass of firstviewcontroller also has a uilabel but has one more uibutton
