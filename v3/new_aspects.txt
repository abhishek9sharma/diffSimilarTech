ubuntu	linux---------------------------------------------------

others
if you do mind using linux you can use ubuntu which is more user-friendly but not really recommended as a server at least for the default version

if you are on linux eg ubuntu you may try gedit for ease of use with some plug-ins but to handle very large files you re better off with vim

also i would recommend doing a dual boot to ubuntu it s much easier to work with opencl in a linux cli fashion

i am new at a firm and i was given a project that was on amazon linux ami now we need to transfer project on another server and because i am more familiar with ubuntu than with amazon linux ami i was wondering if there much difference and will project work perfectly

edit i am using a linux os ubuntu to be more precise

the original linux version obtained similar speeds to windows but recompilation with gcc 4.8.2 under ubuntu 14.04 provided much faster results but not as good as qpar

i don t know why arch linux is slower than ubuntu on your machine

also very particular that this should be done on centos or amazon linux which makes things worse for me as i have been on ubuntu for long

you can use alpine linux docker image it is very light and is better than both ubuntu and centos image to be used as the docker

seek_hole support in the ext4 filesystem was added to linux in the 3.8 kernel ubuntu 12.04 uses an older kernel than that - your kernel version is 3.2.0-45

and in the future i think you will get better help by posting ubuntu related questions to unix and linux stack or to dedicated to ubuntu

in my opinion windows is not the best for development i have so much problems using windows and had the same problem later i ve switched to ubuntu just learn more linux and c - it has so much built-in programs so you don t have to install it by yourself and you won t have any problems with that little problems and get even more knowledge

linux however is less forgiving and has a filesystem that is case sensitive at least my dev ubuntu version does but i guess it is the default for linux

here is a bash script that can use after you installed bash from msys or you can sort it with a linux box - ubuntu is no bigger than 800mb and can run as livecd without interfering your current windows system and the livecd can double as a system saver when needed

sometimes a linux distribution contains far more than an operating system but is informally referred to by a single name such as ubuntu and so the line between what the operating system is the linux kernel and standard libraries perhaps and the applications that merely ship with that operating system the gnome and kde environments on linux is pretty gray

i already have everything working on ubuntu but i can t seem to get inkscape installed on amazon linux to have a better renderer

if you just want the fun of linux command line programs without access to all of ubuntu cygwin is smaller and might be faster

however linux pretend i said ubuntu is even better environment for ruby on rails development and it installs great in vm

questions about using a desktop or laptop gnu linux system are better directed towards super user unix linux or ask ubuntu

i am running a windows 10 pc - i7-6700 3.4ghz 4 cores - hyperthreaded - so 8 logical cores 32gb ram and have a linux vm ubuntu 16.04 using hyper v

even if you re on linux it s much easier to get a precompiled version sudo apt install r-cran-rgl on ubuntu if you have the appropriate cran repositories set up

base r seems to work fine in linux windows 10 uses 20gb of disc space whereas ubuntu only needs a few gb the ram needed with ubuntu is slightly lower

my call is not working but if i have a colleague run the php on his linux box running an older version of ubuntu php it works fine

ubuntu is getting closer but there are still numerous things with linux that will keep the grandmothers of the world from using it

see but if you are using a linux distro there may be shortcut instructions that make it simpler under ubuntu for example there are shortcuts in

one one ubuntu distro fuser -n tcp 3000 will report a process if i own the process yet on another linux distro i think centos it won t report the process even if i own it


gnu cs distro
although if you aren t interested in using adobe cs you can use ubuntu distro which is easier than other linux distro and quiet popular so you won t have any problem finding solution

under a gnu linux distribution like ubuntu everything is much more easier and you can just plug in your device without installing anything you just have to set the right permissions for the device once


windows ecosystem baremetal
i m working with both ubuntu mac but i like staying with the linux system feels faster and more stable for me

i can understand windows 10 performing faster than linux on vm but why is the baremetal ubuntu so slow

while ruby and rails don t change as often as they did a few years ago the dev ecosystem still evolves faster than linux distributions like ubuntu can keep up with


qstring	qmap---------------------------------------------------

others
more than a qmap of qstring to


box-sizing	margin---------------------------------------------------

others
note that in addition to changing the images widths i also changed the margin to padding and made use of the box-sizing attribute read more about it here


do-while	goto---------------------------------------------------

others
but goto is rarely used in modern coding it is not likely to perform any better than a do-while loop after compiler optimizations are applied and it has limitations on how it can be used


uitableview	nsindexpath---------------------------------------------------

others
then in the function tableview tableview uitableview cellforrowatindexpath indexpath nsindexpath i got the lower image in the first row and the upper image in the last row invisible


libjpeg	libtiff---------------------------------------------------

others
the situation is critical if on some platform libtiff provides a narrower functionality and does not link to libjpeg which will not be available on that platform at all so the above command for linking will fail due to unsatisfied library dependency


uuid	mac-address---------------------------------------------------

others
in fact v1 uuid is more fit than v4 if you use the uuid just as a table id - because it uses mac-address and time stamp to prevent clashes


qapplication	qcoreapplication---------------------------------------------------

others
if you need to detect key events globally in the whole application then you can catch and process them in reimplemented qapplication notify for more details how to use qcoreapplication notify see qt docs on that


onclick	onfocus---------------------------------------------------

others
also the onfocus event would be more appropriate than onclick because it handles other scenarios such as pressing the tab key to change the active input


vbscript	vb6---------------------------------------------------

others
from vbscript s help same as vb6 s help but less clicks to get to on my computer

vb6 vba though a little better than vbscript in general still has many similar issues where for their domain they require much more boiler plate to do simple tasks than what i would like and have seen in other scripting languages

vbscript is much more convenient than creating an activex on vb6 or c# vb.net


pugixml	rapidxml---------------------------------------------------

others
quoting rapidxml s author i would like to thank arseny kapoulkine for his work on pugixml which was an inspiration for this project and 5 - 30 faster than pugixml the fastest xml parser i know of he had tested against version 0.3 of pugixml which has reached recently version 0.42


umask	sudo---------------------------------------------------

others
if you forget to use this and your default umask is more restrictive or less restrictive then you will need to re-run the non- sudo


eventlet	gevent---------------------------------------------------

others
but this popular wsgi benchmark says eventlet is way slower than gevent

the use of gevent is also a performant option but slightly lower than eventlet

gevent is inspired by eventlet but features more consistent api


colt	jama---------------------------------------------------

others
colt does this already but i have found it is more complicated and more powerful than jama which may explain why simple functions are slower with colt


stdout	stderr---------------------------------------------------

others
it also allows you to redirect the stderr into the stdout which makes it easier to read

you can also use processbuilder to redirect the stderr through the stdout to make life easier using processbuilder#redirecterrorstream boolean

stderr is better than stdout for errors for a couple of reasons

the dualconsolehandler looks like this found in another so question the idea being to print info or lower to stdout but warning or higher to stderr

this works with python 2.7.3 the command to pipe stderr to stdout has changed since older versions of python

in other words instead of mis-using stderr like this - look into ways to gain more control over stdout


bellman-ford	dijkstra---------------------------------------------------

others
if you want to have all all shortest paths from all nodes to all other nodes you can just run dijkstra from each node or you can try bellman-ford which is bit faster but a little bit harder to grasp

after a lot of googling i ve found that most sources say that the dijkstra algorithm is more efficient than the bellman-ford algorithm

since a proper implementation of dijkstra is faster than bellman-ford use dijkstra unless there are negative weight edges in the graph

bellman-ford as suggested in your question tends to be slower than either dijkstra s or a - it is primarily used when there are negative edge-weights which there are not here

in fact i think it is fair to say that bellman-ford is more similar to dijkstra because of its use of iterative relaxation

the only issue with applying that technique for the single source shortest path problem is that reweighting with bellman-ford takes o mn time which is slower than dijkstra s o m log n


non-positive weights approach
however if g is guaranteed to have only non-negative weights g is non-positive weights then dijkstra s algorithm could be better choice over bellman-ford

surely there is some situation in which the bellman-ford approach is better than the dijkstra approach

but under what circumstances is the bellman-ford algorithm better than the dijkstra algorithm


lodash	underscore.js---------------------------------------------------

others
ps i d suggest using lodash instead of underscore.js if possible as lodash development is more active but that s my opinion

lodash is definitely not slower than underscore.js

the easiest solution is to just replace underscore.js with lodash which has even more features than the latest underscore.js

based on why lodash is faster than native foreach post maybe it s justifiable to use lodash in favour of both underscore.js and native foreach to loop

apparently almost completely compatible lodash runs quicker apparently but underscore.js has better doco imho

lodash is another faster implementation of underscore.js that will provide a lot of utility methods for working wit arrays objects functions etc

given that this is 4 years old and lodash has more or less taken the place of underscore.js i thought i would share this solution using lodash

lodash is more modular than underscore.js underscore.js around 5kb lodash around 17kb but is generally lighter because you only include the specific modules you need

basically collections are things that implement some kind of iterable interface and they internally use the same iteration method though lodash source is a bit more convoluted than underscore.js


better consistency performance
if you re open to using lodash which is a better version of underscore.js imo this can be expressed fairly simply using flattendeep on each element of your multi-dimensional array

keep in mind that i am using lodash by john-david dalton instead of underscore.js because lodash provides better performance and a custom build process

i believe lodash is a better choice over underscore.js more details in this blog post

note previously this answer recommended underscore.js but lodash has done a better job of getting bugs fixed and addressing issues with consistency

edit as pointed out in the comment lodash is likely to be a better solution than underscore.js

then when you extract the keys of each object you can compare using _.isequal function by provided by lodash instead of underscore.js usually lodash has better performance

i can help you with lodash which is a superset of underscore.js and much better than underscore.js when it comes to performance and consistency see lodash vs underscore.js


non-native native stunned
in general and underscore.js are slower native bind is fast on some browsers slow on v8 and lodash can distinguish between the two

the solution from charliefl is approximately 100x faster than underscore.js depending on browser in this case and lodash being up to 2x faster than underscore.js

you can also use underscore.js but lodash is faster more complete and you can create custom build with only what you need

i am stunned right now seeing a lodash performing 100-150 faster than underscore.js in even simple native functions such as array.every in chrome

if i remember correctly lodash argued they were faster than underscore.js because the use non-native functions for key operations


glfw	lwjgl---------------------------------------------------

others
so glfw is just a library for creating windows in a better way than lwjgl did before


selenium	sahi---------------------------------------------------

others
there are certain types of browser event that selenium struggles with that sahi handles much better


opencv	cimg---------------------------------------------------

others
i believe it is significantly simpler than opencv which on a raspberry pi for example takes around 1gb of space and over an hour to build whereas cimg is a single header-only file that you include in your code with no libraries needing to be installed which can do what you ask


ocamllex	ocamlyacc---------------------------------------------------

others
or ocamllex + ocamlyacc should be more than enough


highcharts	gridster---------------------------------------------------

others
if i resize the window and a widget with a highcharts is bigger than the window i want to resize it to make it smaller and gridster should recalculate the positions of the others


odoo	openerp---------------------------------------------------

others
its just a name they choosed it because odoo provides more than openerp for example web site modules


onmousemove	mouseup---------------------------------------------------

others
the active selector handles the mouse click much better than mouseup down you just need a way of reading that state in the onmousemove event


mono	xamarin.android---------------------------------------------------

others
i m using xamarin.android to write c# but the native java rsa key generator is much faster than the mono one


cocoapods	carthage---------------------------------------------------

others
i m currently using carthage as a dependency manager and i know cocoapods is more popular and maybe swift package manager will be something in the near future - so i d like to be able to publish the extensions so people using any of these package managers can easily add them to their projects


atan2	sqrt---------------------------------------------------

others
indeed sqrt is better than atan2 and 1 sqrt is better than sqrt

with typical libraries on common modern hardware sqrt is faster than atan2


ceil	floor---------------------------------------------------

others
the floor times the ceil are greater than the floor xy...that s very much possible

in general case you need to determine maximum and minimum shape coordinates along every axis and define minimum axis aligned integer bounding box with values rounded to larger using ceil for max and rounded to smaller using floor for min coordinates

â when using drawimage coordinates will be rounded for you you might want to do the rounding yourself since it is floor that is used and that ceil that gives smoother results


direction axis idx
on the other hand if what you want to do is not rounding but elimination of fractions into one direction then you have std ceil that goes always higher and std floor that always goes lower

so floor idx is the lower element and ceil idx is the higher

now if floor is higher than 0 or ceil is lower than 0 on any axis it means that there just as many tiles outside of the camera scoop


greater function decimal
works because ceil a b is always one greater than floor a b except when a b is a whole number

a simple function to follow would be if greater than 0 floor else ceil using a multiplier to raise it above the decimal point temporarily whilst doing it


ng-show	ng-hide---------------------------------------------------

others
please don t change code like using ng-hide instead of ng-show and add more extra div


qlistwidget	qtreewidget---------------------------------------------------

others
posting here an example showing how to implement same approach but now applied to qtreewidget which a bit more involved than qlistwidget


ubuntu	centos---------------------------------------------------

others
centos by its nature is quite a conservative distro - so if you are after the latest codecs media support then fedora or ubuntu may be better options

is there anything obvious in ubuntu that would otherwise be making sfphpview- render run slower than centos

i believe that ubuntu is better than centos when it comes to mono as it is much easier to setup and seems to be better supported

also very particular that this should be done on centos or amazon linux which makes things worse for me as i have been on ubuntu for long

i don t know if it s activated by default on centos but it might be considering it is on ubuntu which is less entreprise oriented

on centos dnf install zint ubuntu takes more work

centos is more consistent and reliable because it is enterprise while ubuntu is geared towards desktops and personal computers

one one ubuntu distro fuser -n tcp 3000 will report a process if i own the process yet on another linux distro i think centos it won t report the process even if i own it

in this respect ubuntu is less desirable on a server than rhel or centos which stick to more mature versions


versions libraries rhel
this is because your ubuntu system has newer system libraries than your centos one

newer rhel centos have newer compilers but i d actually recommend ubuntu s lts versions


pop-up	dialog---------------------------------------------------

others
i encourage you to upgrade jquery mobile to 1.3.x and take a look at jquery mobile 1.3 s pop-up widget which is different from the dialog and works more like what you want than dialog does

i think it s a better idea to show a div as dialog in the middle of your website because the chance that this is pop-up blocked is smaller and it s imo less annoying

the purpose of this parameter is to tell the dialog what setting it will be shown in â and if thatâ s pop-up then the dialog elements are rendered smaller than they would be in the full page version

of course the println would pop-up a dialog or do something more useful to the final user

when you press print in calendar print preview the print dialog that pop-up has more options cross browsers

one of the button as you can see in the code below is a preview button where if clicked another dialog will pop-up to display more info about the intended operation consequences

dialog is designed for more interactive pop-up where-as a toast is really designed to display a quick text message

feed dialog is more intrusive in the sense that it has a facebook pop-up window


better login main
generally a pop-up is a better option for a login dialog and a pop-up would allow you to easily navigate to the main page

use floating divs instead which looks like a modal dialog but are better than the pop-up


ui anchor instance
but i dont like system pop-up and think more userfriendly will be customized pop-up section for instance jquery ui dialog

i am using jquery ui dialog to show more than one pop-up on one page each pop-up will have its own id and it will be triggered by an anchor with a attribute


windows box boxes
when typing in the text box the autocomplete pop-up but is bigger than the remaining space in the modal dialog

from a practice standpoint - excluding accessibility - modal windows provide an alternative that are less startling as say dialog boxes and feel less intrusive than pop-up windows

because of datebox pop-up z-index is less then your box mean dialog box s z-index it shows behind pop-up panel

the pop-up windows are very easy to implement and the modal dialog boxes are even easier


window larger contents
this will allow it to pop-up like a dialog but give you more flexibility and easier to manipulate imho

dialog makes it easier for you to create a pop-up window with customized contents

the issue i m having is that when the height of the page is smaller than the pop-up it opens a dialog instead of a pop-up

is there a way to allow the pop-up window to expand beyond the dialog but be bounded by the window and thus provide scrolling when the pop-up is larger than the window

when a user clicks on a particular image a dialog window is supposed to pop-up and display a larger version of said image

i realize this is an older post but we just ran into the same issue and resolved it by setting the z-index of the bubble pop-up to something higher than the dialog window


afnetworking	sdwebimage---------------------------------------------------

others
sdwebimage claims that afnetworking doesn t cache the image itself but just the http response so sdwebimage is faster in recalling the image from cache and presenting it

so i think afnetworking would a better choice than sdwebimage


fread	textscan---------------------------------------------------

others
then for reading i find textscan to be more powerful than fread fscanf the differences between them all are summarized here


struts	stripes---------------------------------------------------

others
i ve found stripes to be really effective and surprisingly lightweight....it aims to be more lightweight than struts

struts 2 and stripes are more modern and very similar to each other

and beware that in this area there are many much more alternatives or fragmentation than in .net some more oriented to the mvc pattern struts struts2 stripes spring mvc some more component-based jsf tapestry wicket and some others gwt

stripes the actionbean approach doesn t look much better than struts


bellman-ford	floyd-warshall---------------------------------------------------

others
because bellman-ford runs in time o mn the overall asymptotic runtime is still o mn + n 2 log n so if m o n 2 note that this is little-o of n this approach is asymptotically faster than using floyd-warshall


lisp	rebol---------------------------------------------------

others
aside does this mean rebol is more homoiconic than lisp


memset	malloc---------------------------------------------------

others
it requests memory from the os kernel but the request is not satisfied until the memory is written to with memset . this allows for greater efficiency in the system s memory management but it can result in misleading malloc behaviour

calloc is faster than malloc + memset because calloc knows that the mmap d pages are pre-zeroed and memset forces the allocation of physical ram

after a malloc you ll better clear the entire zone with memset


better combo zeros
it takes a page off of the free_page_list updates mem_map zeroes the page and returns the physical address of the page. here s another post that explains it well and also explains why using calloc is better than malloc + memset

malloc + memset is slower than calloc under certain conditions

it s conceivable that calloc could return address of memory location that is already pre-initialized with zeros thus it may be faster than malloc + memset combo

one reason to use calloc over malloc plus memset is that calloc may be more efficient

actually calling memset after malloc is closer to calling calloc than the option you suggest

it will be presumably more efficient than malloc + memset for large allocations

this means calloc can potentially be faster than calling malloc followed by memset since it can skip the memset if it knows it will already by zeroed

in terms of speed calloc is likely to be faster than malloc + memset if memory needs to be zeroed out

my question is why is malloc + memset so much slower than calloc

see also why malloc + memset is slower than calloc


xfs	ntfs---------------------------------------------------

others
extfs4 or xfs are between 25 and 40 faster than ntfs or refs depending on the optimization

actual mounting of filesystems is trickier business and really depends on what you are mounting - ntfs fat ext3 xfs nfs cifs webdav etc etc


webkit	gecko---------------------------------------------------

others
webkit is stricter than gecko

it s called web audio api and is currently a draft but is well supported by webkit you ll need to use prefixes and a little less by gecko

anyway i just prefer not to use it because gecko is slower then webkit

somehow webkit seems to do better than gecko on the html5 single-page spec scripts and i can t figure out why at this point

some user agents like those based on gecko implement this requirement and others like those based on webkit are less strict

my understanding is webkit is pretty good smaller than gecko

gecko seems to like anti-aliasing more than webkit

gecko is often considered to consume less memory than webkit but this depends a lot on how the browser is implemented

i m developing with canvas too and have found that webkit based browsers in general handle canvas operations quicker than gecko in most cases


hbase	impala---------------------------------------------------

others
hbase is schema less and from hbase you can create impala or hive external tables

hbase will be faster if you have a good key design and a proper schema because just like with hive impala will translate your where into scan filters it ll depend a lot on the type of queries you run


division	subtraction---------------------------------------------------

tricky higher testing
division is performed by repeated subtraction therefore needs more level of subtract logic making division slower than addition

i found it fairly easy to generate addition subtraction and multiplication questions at random however division is more tricky

notice that by making the rule for contain the rule for this grammar makes sure all multiplication division operations occur lower in the parse tree than any addition subtraction

subtraction operations and usually significantly faster than multiplication and division

for floating point operations addition and subtraction are harder than multiplication and division so they may be slower or not again it depends on how much transistor real estate there is dedicated to the fpu

finally we all know that multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction so we can remove the extraneous parentheses so this turns into

the addition and subtraction are much more than multiplication and division

i know the basics division and multiplication higher than addition and subtraction but i would have to look up something more esoteric

multiplication division and modulo have the same precedence and they all have higher precedence than addition and subtraction

the intuition would say addition subtraction are faster than multiplication division but is that really correct

it is also possible to manipulate the inputs so that various parts of the calculation return 0 for addition or subtraction or 1 for multiplication or division to make testing easier but this only gets me so far

remember multiplication division and remainder operators are all higher precedence than subtraction

i don t understand why the division multiplication in c++ is so much slower than addition subtraction where the managed c# version is more reasonable to my expectations

that s because the division operator has a higher precedence than the subtraction operator -

division multiplication has higher precedence than addition subtraction and parentheses is required to do addition subtraction before multiplication division

typically operations like addition and subtraction are much faster in integer -- multiplication and division less so

knuth writes that fibonacci search is preferable on some computers because it involves only addition and subtraction not division by 2. but almost all computers use binary arithmetic in which division by 2 is simpler than addition and subtraction

multiplication and division operators have higher precedence than addition and subtraction in c++ same as in scientific notation

multiplication and division have higher priority than addition and subtraction

doesn t get evaluated the way you are expecting the division operator has higher precedence than the subtraction operator

multiplication and division have a higher precedence than addition and subtraction

this is happening because the concatenation operator has a higher precedence than the addition or subtraction operators but multiplication and division have a higher precedence then concatenation

apart from that multiplication is addition done more than once and division is subtraction done more than once

i don t think they have a natural precedence unlike say multiplication and division being of greater precedence than subtraction and addition because they can be built from subtraction and addition

indicates that multiplication and division have more precedence than sum and subtraction

in general you ll have more variation with multiplication and division than with addition and subtraction

integer multiplication division and modulo are much slower than integer addition and subtraction

to start with i need multiplication and division to take higher precedence than addition and subtraction

nothing follows the rule of multiplication and division having more precedence over addition and subtraction

the term is apparently not an exact measurement as it is clear that a double-precision floating-point operation is going to take longer than a single-precision one and multiplication and division are going to take longer than addition and subtraction

because the division operator has higher precedence than subtraction

in this case division has higher precedence than subtraction parenthesis around the division or not

division has a higher precedence than addition or subtraction so it s really this

it will be much slower i don t have benchmarks but i would guess at least an order of magnitude maybe more decimal will not benefit from any hardware acceleration and arithmetic on it will require relatively expensive multiplication division by powers of 10 which is far more expensive than multiplication and dividion by powers of 2 to match the exponent before addition subtraction and to bring the exponent back into range after multiplication division


others
subtraction and maybe negative numbers and division are more complicated so i m omitting them for now

this is much faster than the division by repeated subtraction method since it converges to the result quadratically instead of linearly

a floating point subtraction should be faster than converting to a string and back which involves a lot of division

pencil and paper division in base 2 32 or 2 64 would be a lot more efficient than division by subtraction and i believe that gmp employs a better algorithm than that

this is because division operator has higher preference than the subtraction operator - in the first example you use are not using brackets therefore division takes place first you can change your code to

without parentheses math.exp c b is executed first as division has higher precedence than subtraction -

it may not be the most elegant method but when you just need to convert something ad-hoc thinking of it as comparison and subtraction may be easier than division

division has higher precedence than subtraction so in the first two examples only the second number is being divided

i am a bit suspicious of the performance because modulo tends to use division which is slower than your subtraction operations

put each token +- of final command string in a list maybe a binary tree works and sort that list to tell the calculator that division and multiplication has the highest priority in the mean time addition and subtraction has lower priority

in this since division has greater precedence than subtraction therefore x 10 will execute first and here we are dividing two int irrespective of the fact that the variable where final answer is stored is a double so answer will be an int i.e 5 10 0 and then subtraction of an int and double will be done here int will be promoted to a double

the addition and subtraction is okay because the types of a and b force them to be performed using floating point arithmetic - but because division binds more tightly than addition and subtraction it s like using the brackets above only the immediate operands are considered

division has higher precedence than subtraction

subtraction is similar using subtraction of the base type and borrow instead of carry multiplication can be done with repeated additions very slow or cross-products faster and division is trickier but can be done by shifting and subtraction of the numbers involved the long division you would have learned as a kid

this platform is probably not representative of your microcontroller but the test shows that on this platform the subtraction is considerably slower than the division


root optimization cheaper
this is called a strength reduction operation because subtraction is a weaker and cheaper operation than division

the division operation binds tighter than i.e is evaluated ahead of the subtraction so you are taking a square root of a negative number

this is called a strength reduction optimization because division is stronger slower more expensive than subtraction


stringbuilder	printwriter---------------------------------------------------

others
btw unless you are using java 1.4 or older you can use stringbuilder instead of stringbuffer although in this case printwriter would be even better


domcontentloaded	onload---------------------------------------------------

others
sometimes it s preferable because onload event takes longer to fire then domcontentloaded


keras	pylearn---------------------------------------------------

others
and using keras or lasagne is way simpler to develop nns then pure theano which was just side research project in montreal to support development of pylearn


invalidoperationexception	argumentexception---------------------------------------------------

others
i think the argumentexception is more appropriate because the invalidoperationexception documentation says that the object itself on what the method is called has to be in an invalid state right


ng-view	ng-controller---------------------------------------------------

others
unlike the ng-view it s possible that there are more than one ng-controller in the same page


fgets	getline---------------------------------------------------

others
i should also mention that there are probably better way to get line-based input in both c fgets or see an earlier answer of mine and c++ such as the string getline and the char array getline

getline is far more flexible handling the allocation of space for you with fgets it is up to you

your code is trying to do the former but you probably meant to do the latter in which case getline may be easier to use than mucking about with fgets

you should use getline instead of fgets to make things easier

if you cannot tolerate that use getline it s harder to use so use fgets if in doubt

one more edit if you want to use getline instead which you asked about in the comments - and it s even safer than fgets since it will increase the buffer size as needed you would change to change the code a little bit

when taking user input a line-oriented function like fgets or posix getline are much less prone to causing subtle errors you just need to remember to trim the trailing n included by each in the buffer they fill


example line read
since i provided a getline example above your read loop can be much better written with fgets as follows

while this is fine in some cases where flexibility is needed reading a line at a time with getline of fgets is the better choice


devise	sorcery---------------------------------------------------

others
check out sorcery it s more lightweight and less obscure than devise

it s easy to use a gem for this such as devise which does a lot or sorcery which does less so may be easier to understand and alter as you like


antivirus	norton---------------------------------------------------

others
many other antivirus software that works just as well if not better than norton like avg avast and others do allow you to uninstall from the add remove


stateless	stateful---------------------------------------------------

convenient ejb3 lighter
while this is much less convenient than stateful wicket i still find much better than say stateless jsf or struts

for certain kinds of transactions a stateless session may perform slightly faster than a stateful session

service to build drools knowledge and get session i prepared a stateless engine lighter than the stateful one

in ejb3 there is no such thing as stateless is better than stateful session beans


others
dealing with a stateless cluster is often simpler then dealing with a stateful cluster

while a lot of development has been done with stateless connections to solve most problems sometimes it s just simpler with stateful connections

so because stateless components are easier to keep bug-free the rule of thumb when working with react is to have as few stateful components as possible and to keep those in the top of the component hierarchy

a stateful service is typically harder to develop and scale than stateless services

but note that while stateful isn t used much these days it usually makes more sense to opt-in for stateless sessionscope is much more universal and fits into nearly any session-based scenario

the restful services are rather thin and completely stateless whereas the admin console is stateful and has more interactive functionality and therefore more memory and processing required

stateless ejb are faster then stateful ejb

i think stateful client stateless server makes you more aware of the amount of data that is transported back and forth between tires

or in short stateless is better than stateful

do you have any situation where stateful is more appropriate than stateless

but keep in mind that in many cases being stateful or not stateless is no problem and not all stateless applications are by definition better than stateful ones


uipangesturerecognizer	uiswipegesturerecognizer---------------------------------------------------

others
uipangesturerecognizer gives you precise movement data whereas uiswipegesturerecognizer is more basic and just detects whether or not a swipe happened and in which direction

if you want to use a continuous gesture that tracks the user s finger you can use uipangesturerecognizer rather than uiswipegesturerecognizer and i think animatewithduration is better than catransition in that case


pylons	turbogears---------------------------------------------------

others
you may want to look at turbogears which is built on top of pylons and has more out of the box things for you to use

the difference between pylons and pyramid are the merge of repoze.bfg and turbogears which brings more api resources


jax-ws	saaj---------------------------------------------------

others
one could use saaj soap with attachments api for java which runs at a lower level than jax-ws


cout	ofstream---------------------------------------------------

others
ofstream might be slighlty faster than cout depending on yor libc++ implementation different buffer sizes thread synchronization ...


comparator	icomparer---------------------------------------------------

others
using a separate icomparaer comparator approach is a more generic form of using a sortkey field with the additional ordering mixed into the comparator because such a field could be used by such a icomparer implementation


spring-data-commons	spring-data-jpa---------------------------------------------------

others
you may encounter noclassdeffounderror if the version of spring-data-commons is older then required by spring-data-jpa


pjax	history.js---------------------------------------------------

others
history.js does everything pjax does and better so no need to mix the two


vmware	virtualbox---------------------------------------------------

good free powerfull
virtualbox free but less powerfull than vmware

even though vmware has been faster for me i still use virtualbox because it s good enough and is free and im cheap


others
i really miss this feature on virtualbox because i find vmware to be bloated and it slows the host system down much more than virtualbox does

i have successfully set up vvv on virtualbox in the past but i ve been told vmware is much faster

vmware has more features but costs 80 virtualbox on the other hand is more basic but is free for most users see virtualbox licensing faq for details

i managed to use andlinux + wine to get this working but honestly i think the vmware virtual pc virtualbox route is simpler

im trying very hard to like virtualbox but so far i find it so much worse than vmware in so many ways

virtualbox no vmware because virtualbox is more user friendly

however i found that vmware is much more stable full screen resolution much much better to handle the iphone connection via usb and i didn t have yet any crash when on virtualbox it s quite often


slower better server
virtualbox is slower than vmware

fwiw i have never gotten freebsd to work properly under virtualbox perhaps if you need that you would be better off with vmware which does

i am not sure if vmware server will be much better than virtualbox

in my experience i ve found that vmware seems to be faster than virtualbox although i don t have any hard data to back it up

from my experience vmware 5 is faster than virtualbox 4.2 rc3 and has better smp performance


vxworks	qnx---------------------------------------------------

others
in the non open-source world choices are wider such as qnx neutrino and vxworks


kde	gnome---------------------------------------------------

others
on kde aptana ran perfectly quicker than on gnome at the best of times

on gnome gtk+ can be seen as more native whereas on kde qt is more native


fonts tools larger
i am trying to explore kde a bit but many of the tools i rely on have fonts that appear so much bigger under kde than gnome even though the chosen font size is the same and the resolution is the same 1920x1200

the motivation is that font size 12 under kde seems to be much larger than under gnome


soappy	suds---------------------------------------------------

others
finally if soappy just isn t working for you try suds it s better documented than soappy


daemons	launchd---------------------------------------------------

others
that code is all being launchd from a daemons thread created earlier

what i thought is that if i can configure launchagent or daemons then i will provide path to mongod of bin directory of mongodb folder and provide --config and path for .conf file as argument and then i need to just launchd mongod using launchctl with name mongod and it will start

maybe it is but it is much easier than launchd agent in other session from daemons when implemented right with different corner cases support

if you want more control over launchd background processes from ruby including properly detaching ttys and a host of other things check out the daemons gem


jpype	py4j---------------------------------------------------

others
in terms of performance py4j has a bigger overhead than both of the previous solutions jython and jpype because it relies on sockets but if performance is critical to your application accessing java objects from python programs might not be the best idea


jobs	cron---------------------------------------------------

others
also you might fill the que really easy with the cron which might lead to jobs being executed longer

i would suggest scheduling your jobs using something more sophisticated than cron

check out the quartz scheduler it does what cron does and more is easily integrated in a web app and allows you to call jobs written in java without any complicated plumbing

edit btw the idea using cron for checking for new jobs to execute is better but only if you have a small website and you don t need to do load balancing for the jobs

if you can predict more than one cron job to be executed you can try or any other library like this where you can config jobs scheduler in php

btw for cron at jobs is better to use absolute directory pathes not relative


mp4	h.264---------------------------------------------------

others
h.264 is more often encapsulated in mp4 container and vp8 in mkv

when i demux an mp4 with ffmpeg the provided sps at the beginning of the raw h.264 stream is richer than mine

both formats flv vs mp4 can contain exact same data h.264 video with mp3 or aac audio but mp4 is supported in more devices software

but i don t know why the size of mp4 video with h.264 codec is bigger than the size of the image set in the only implementation i found so i made my own archive format that is basically the imageset merged together in 1 file and compressed with snappy plus the info for split them again


alternative avi platforms
- you can also consider using webm which is a free alternative to h.264 and has better support on some platforms than fragmented mp4

it doesn t support avi at the moment but imho mp4 format is better suited for h.264 anyway


emacs	aquamacs---------------------------------------------------

others
however i m not really much of an emacs user and the preferences menu in aquamacs is less than clear on where and how one might make such a change

carbon emacs is closer to the unix emacs experience whereas the aquamacs people have put considerable effort into os x integration

you may also want to look at aquamacs which currently has a beta for the latest emacs and offers somewhat better os x integration than the default build

on unix like environments emacs is more native and you can use slime which is usually available as a os package or as a separate download for aquamacs


codeblocks	codelite---------------------------------------------------

others
we sort of settled on it but later found codelite and liked it better than codeblocks


ninject	linfu---------------------------------------------------

others
mef linfu and spring.net are faster than ninject but still pretty


prng	random---------------------------------------------------

pseudorandom numbers source
would it maybe be wise to use this somewhat dynamic memory usage as a seed for a prng to generate more quickly random numbers

if you seed a prng from a truly random source and then just keep calling the prng to get more numbers then you will just have a pseudorandom sequence of numbers albeit well seeded


others
to avoid having to do so many reads from dev random which can run out of entropy you can instead do as indiv suggested in the comments seed a prng to generate more seeds

but a large period prng takes up more memory for maintaining the internal state and also takes more time for generating a random number due to complex transitions and post processing

however the wikipedia article on gamma random variables suggest that more sophisticated methods are used in generating gamma random variables methods which involve multiple calls to the underlying prng

a proper prng should be much faster than division on big integers so this should be a better trade-off -- but this really depends on the performance of the random source and since it is a question of performance it cannot be fully answered without trying


reflection structure good
the non-random random behaviour is more a reflection on the quality of the rand prng â it is often not very good

then you use it as seed in random which is less good that one is a non-cryptographic prng and its output may exhibit some structure which will not register in a statistical measurement tool but might be exploited by an intelligent attacker


unixodbc	iodbc---------------------------------------------------

others
the iodbc included with os x has some things that are listed as deprecated and i ve had better luck with unixodbc in the past


exponent	modulo---------------------------------------------------

others
in the most simple way you can look at rsa one key of a keypair is nothing more than an exponent and a common modulo .

little wonder you get errors the exponent is normally shorter than the modulo which is always the same size as the key size

using the pow function and passing a modulo value is faster than computing the full exponent and then taking the modulo because the modulo can be applied to the partial products at each stage of the calculation which stops the value from getting too large 10 6 to the power of 10 6 has 6 million decimal digits with a modulo applied at each step the values never have to grow larger than the size of the modulo - about 13 digits in this example


note value lower
the private exponent is always smaller than the modulo so you should be able to encrypt it using the raw rsa operation if you make sure to remove the prepended zero

note that the private exponent is limited to value of the modulo but may sometimes be up to a few bytes smaller than the modulo

in rsa signing a message m means exponentiation with the private exponent d the result r is the smallest integer 0 and smaller than the modulo n so that

1024 bit private exponent large number lower than the modulo


better rsa risk
i must also add that designing the rsa key so that the private exponent is substantially shorter than the modulo to speed up operations is a security risk if the exponent is smaller than 29 of the modulo length then the key can be cracked

when i generate rsa key pairs by openssl it seems like private key private exponent is always less than public key modulo

edit as gregs points out in the comments you cannot be sure that the private exponent of the key you want to encrypt is smaller than the modulo of the key you want to use to encrypt with

so no choice of the public exponent for this modulo is better than 19 using the public exponent to decrypt will work for at least half of the messages when eâ² 9 16 and in many cases for almost all the messages when eâ² 1 16

the rsa private exponent may actually be shorter than the modulo

the private exponent must not be longer than the modulo


express	everyauth---------------------------------------------------

others
note that mongoose-auth is built on everyauth and they will work fine but i like the flexibility of the strategies concept from passport and the express integration is better


memset	calloc---------------------------------------------------

others
an aligned calloc would have required more than wrapping on many platforms to offer more than the aligned_malloc + memset pair thus could be considered inventive and thus was left out

in some cases calloc will do less work because it can skip memset entirely

in other words calloc is no more type-wise than memset

calloc returns tha address of a block of memory initialized to all bits zero which has the same effect as calling memset but is potentially more efficient


conditions allocation efficient
the pattern above is very likely recognised by your compiler and replaced by highly optimised code which will be as fast if not faster as memset but not calloc

it takes a page off of the free_page_list updates mem_map zeroes the page and returns the physical address of the page. here s another post that explains it well and also explains why using calloc is better than malloc + memset

malloc + memset is slower than calloc under certain conditions

calloc is faster than malloc + memset because calloc knows that the mmap d pages are pre-zeroed and memset forces the allocation of physical ram

one reason to use calloc over malloc plus memset is that calloc may be more efficient

this is an enormous amount of extra work and explains why calloc is faster than malloc and memset

actually calling memset after malloc is closer to calling calloc than the option you suggest

in terms of speed calloc is likely to be faster than malloc + memset if memory needs to be zeroed out

this means calloc can potentially be faster than calling malloc followed by memset since it can skip the memset if it knows it will already by zeroed

my question is why is malloc + memset so much slower than calloc

see also why malloc + memset is slower than calloc

and is as far as i know faster than the combination of malloc and memset on the other hand malloc alone is faster than calloc


end ridiculous conceivable
it s conceivable that calloc could return address of memory location that is already pre-initialized with zeros thus it may be faster than malloc + memset combo

if end up using the memory anyway calloc is still faster than malloc and memset but the difference is not quite so ridiculous


tinyint	varchar---------------------------------------------------

others
as varchar n takes spaces much more than tinyint and your main table is table2 so the second scenario is more optimize

the choice of appropriate datatype entirely depends on how you ll be dealing with the table data in your application if any if you re having this table just for storing the records than varchar would be a better option since it ll make your data more verbose but if there s a processing to be done on the table data like filter results on certain criteria long names could be confusing when it comes to comparing them in the application logic and in such situations char or tinyint would be a better option

using varchar is less efficient than using tinyint like aju john suggested in his comment but unless i m dealing with a really performance-critical or a huge table - i find it easier to deal with

i think tinyint is better than varchar in this case


rtos	isr---------------------------------------------------

others
an rtos could equally trap the usage of a non-isr safe call in an isr and run a more specific error handler if it does not bother to do so then the resulting behaviour might trigger a usage fault


jqmodal	blockui---------------------------------------------------

others
one item to note be aware the default z-index for jqmodal is below default for blockui so using them together requires you set blockui basez option higher than jqmodal s default 3000.


tidyverse	dplyr---------------------------------------------------

others
plyr is an older version of dplyr so i would use the newer one especially because it come in the tidyverse group


toggleclass	slidetoggle---------------------------------------------------

others
toggleclass can accept more than one class and it would be easier to use slidetoggle than animate -


jlabel	jinternalframe---------------------------------------------------

others
my problem is this i don t want the jlabel or the jscrollpane to stretch to the size of the jinternalframe if the jlabel is smaller than the jinternalframe


itextsharp	razorpdf---------------------------------------------------

others
razorpdf uses an older version of itextsharp which i believe was the latest free itextsharp version


qtreeview	qfilesystemmodel---------------------------------------------------

others
i need show files from qfilesystemmodel in qtreeview and customize that tree to show one more column with qcheckbox so user can pick 0..n files from that qtreeview


floating-point	integer---------------------------------------------------

faster slower math
integer math is often much faster than floating-point so such a function could be a major performance win

an individual floating-point division instruction will take longer than an integer one

historically floating-point could be much slower than integer arithmetic

historically floating-point could be much slower than integer

depending on context floating-point code may be as fast as or faster than integer code or it may be four times slower

if all the values vary each time then it seems unlikely that the floating-point division to compute the 1.25 followed by floating-point multiplication is going to be any faster than the integer multiplication followed by integer division

but integer arithmetic arguably is inherently simpler than floating-point

floating-point division is typically faster than integer division on the cpu

as a rule of thumb floating-point is about 2x slower than integer on

you re performing integer division which is coarser than floating-point division

it s even possible that you could implement pong using only integer arithmetic which is likely to be faster than floating-point -- but the difference is unlikely to be critical

there are lots of cpu gpu combinations where a 32b integer multiply is faster than a 32b floating-point multiply on cpu and vice-versa on gpu

floating-point may be somewhat slower than integer but it s generally

if you need more than integer accuracy but want to avoid floating-point consider using fixed-point arithmetic instead

generally integer math is faster than floating-point math

today s floating-point units are pretty fast and may actually divide faster than an integer unit

floating-point divide is faster than integer fewer bits to divide assuming your cpu has floating-point unit

which uses all integer arithmetic is usually faster than its floating-point equivalent likely significantly faster in the case of a floating-point type equivalent to t-sql s decimal type

floating-point arithmetics is by far more complicated than integer arithmetics

they take up more space and floating-point math is slower than integer math

note that it is usually advisable to use an unsigned integer rather than an int to access the bits of floating-point encodings because unsigned integers are less prone to certain issues such as sign issues with bit shifts

but another added benefit of this approach is that it could make your program run faster since fixed-point integer arithmetic is much faster than floating-point arithmetic

i was wondering about some of the math or theory of whether a signed integer or signed floating-point representation in n bits encodes more granularity between its min and max values or if the two encode the same granularity


larger format general
therefore ieee 754 single precision floating-point format has 23-bits fractions and int type has 32 bits so if the integer is larger than 2 24-1 the float type can t represent it exactly

floating-point solves the more general problem of representing some real numbers that aren t integers and some real numbers that are larger than the maximum integer up to which all integers are representable here 16777216 all with a nearly uniform relative accuracy at least 1 2 precision

a floating-point format with a n-bit fractions can t represent the integer which is larger than 2 n+1 -1 because it will lose the precision


others
this feature allows the processor to execute several arithmetic operations simultaneously often four 32-bit integer operations or four 32-bit floating-point operations sometimes more operations with narrower integers sometimes fewer operations with 64-bit floating-point

integer values are easier to deal with than floating-point

there exist processors on which using an integer vector load movdqa to load data that is consumed by a floating-point operation requires more time than using a floating-point load to get data for a floating-point operation and vice-versa

however due to unpredictable floating-point precision issues it is sometimes little less than exact integer and in this case it is rounded down too much

i did this very successfully with scipy.ndimage in the floating-point domain way better results than integer image processing like this

floating-point types have a larger range than the integer types so

floating-point representation in memory can t add third link - because floating-point variables is much more strange than integer ones

on somewhat limited processors like those in high-end cell phones floating-point may be somewhat slower than integer but it s generally within an order of magnitude or better so long as there is hardware floating-point available

because the floating-point value is of a higher rank than an integer it will promote the integer to a float

since the floating-point value is slightly less than the integer you rounded to thanks to .nextdown the integer part is going to be one less than that integer

the difference between each floating-point number and its corresponding integer is less than 1 or equal to 1 if you really must

on intel cpus before skylake packed-integer instructions can always run on more ports than their floating-point counterparts so prefer integer ops


largest root smallest
note that your program may report some numbers as prime if their largest prime factor is very close to their square root if the number is the square of a prime because the conversion of number to a floating-point value may round it down so trsq may end up being less than the square root even less than the largest integer that is smaller than the square root

i know c++ have functions that return largest or smallest integer that is greater or lower than a like ceil or floor.is there a function that implement digit limitation of floating-point variable


types matlab nsdecimalnumber
because integer types like uint8 have saturated arithmetic in matlab plus floating-point types have more precision when doing certain operations

nsdecimalnumber and the floating-point types may be able to store bigger numbers than the integer types though with decreasing precision


nltk	lingpipe---------------------------------------------------

others
alternatively the stanford parser can do the same stuff and might be a bit quicker being java based or lingpipe but nltk is waaaaaay more user friendly

lingpipe probably also has something built in but nltk is much easier to use


heroku	openshift---------------------------------------------------

others
having used both i can tell you that it s a much more polished platform the servers are about 4ã faster you can run as many apps as you want and the heroku toolbelt is much more powerful than the openshift s client tools


screens	hdpi---------------------------------------------------

72x72 tablet dpi
if you re diligent about making graphics for at least the main three densities ldpi mdpi and hdpi then you should not see over-large icons except where the screens is physically smaller than your layout expects it

i am not aware of any device that can use api 14 with a screens density lower than hdpi

edit - now that i think about it i m not sure why your image would appear smaller unless your screens had a greater dpi than hdpi

i have tested that by modifying one image in hdpi folder and keep it as it is in the xhdpi folder the result was note 1 is loading from the xhdpi folder am i missing something here it suppose to load images from the hdpi folder because it s screens density is smaller than 320 dpi

it suppose to load images from the hdpi folder because it s screens density is smaller than 320 dpi

owing to the fact that the screens density on the tablet is smaller android therefore uses the images in the mdpi folder for the tablet and the slightly bigger ones in the hdpi folder for the phone

try placing youre images in res mdpi they will be streched to fit screens which are bigger hdpi xhdpi

ldpi assets will look bad on high density screens but are exponentially smaller than mdpi which is exponentially smaller than hdpi etc

am i missing something here it suppose to load images from the hdpi folder because it s screens density is smaller than 320 dpi

if the screens density is less than xhdpi i load smaller sampled sizes of the 96x96 image - as 36x36 for ldpi 48x48 for mdpi 72x72 for hdpi

even if i create three versions for ldpi mdpi and hdpi there are more than screens resolutions in that table if there is no matching image it will scale my image and may not retain the aspect ratio


others
now i have another device which has the same pixel resolution of 480x800 but since the screens is smaller it has screens size normal and hdpi aka device 2

in my android app i have a background image which is longer than the screens width for all the three types of screens.this implies that i have got 3 drawables each for different screens type mdpi ldpi hdpi and hence i have included a horizontal scroll bar in my app


teamcity	jenkins---------------------------------------------------

others
i know that teamcity has a way of achieving this but i think that jenkins is more constrictive

i prefer using teamcity but jenkins is much more popular


httpclient	jersey-client---------------------------------------------------

others
you can also use jersey-client it is gae compatible and much easier than httpclient


momentjs	bootstrap-datetimepicker---------------------------------------------------

others
since bootstrap-datetimepicker use momentjs it is better to use localized formats from the official documentation


monkeyrunner	adb---------------------------------------------------

others
adb is more reliable since you get the feedback immediately unlike monkeyrunner which does not provide reliable exceptions in case of any failure in triggering the event


oncreate	ondestroy---------------------------------------------------

others
otherwise if oncreate is being called more than ondestroy receiver is registered multiple time and the app mis-behaves


fastcgi	scgi---------------------------------------------------

others
nginx - does not start applications at all however for fastcgi currently not the best for comet streaming because of buffering so scgi would be better with nginx assuming you are using latest nginx version

you can also use scgi it is a lot simpler than fastcgi


querypath	phpquery---------------------------------------------------

others
it is said that phpquery is often faster than querypath because of fewer overall features


pexpect	subprocess---------------------------------------------------

others
you may find this task easier with pexpect which is a third-party module for automating subprocess keyboard interaction


grass	proj---------------------------------------------------

others
you might benefit from combining each proj into a single war but i do think this is really one of those the grass is always greener problems


jqplot	graphael---------------------------------------------------

others
i found jqplot easier to use with more options and better documentation than flot or graphael


uialertview	mbprogresshud---------------------------------------------------

others
mbprogresshud has more features than uialertview so it might be better suited and more easily adapted for your purposes


tabcontrol	tabitem---------------------------------------------------

others
it s almost like the tabcontrol doesnt know to treat the different views as tabitem its behaving more like a stack panel stacking the views

edit i can only reproduce this error when i have a tabcontrol with more than one tabitem

hi there i have define more than one tabitem in my tabcontrol

for example if i click the smaller tabitem the tabcontrol becomes smaller and if i select the bigger one it becomes bigger

i ran into the same visual issue with closable tabs and resolved it by extending both the tabcontrol to be used later in xaml and tabitem classes


restructuredtext	asciidoc---------------------------------------------------

others
beside markdown and restructuredtext there exists also asciidoc which is more powerful than markdown there are f.ex


mapr	cloudera---------------------------------------------------

others
mapr has clearly cheaper tco and technologically superior platform cloudera is a bit more polished hortonworks for pure open source don t read this as free or cheap as most companies end up spending more money on hw to get any value


mybb	ipb---------------------------------------------------

average slower queries
the ipb which has less queries runs slower than mybb with more queries

the ipb one has less queries used only 14 on average but it runs slower than mybb with more queries used average on 20


others

fat	xfs---------------------------------------------------

others
actual mounting of filesystems is trickier business and really depends on what you are mounting - ntfs fat ext3 xfs nfs cifs webdav etc etc


wsimport	wsdl2java---------------------------------------------------

others
wsimport is better don t use wsdl2java


scheme	racket---------------------------------------------------

closer implementations functionality
do racket macros have more advanced functionality than those found in scheme or common lisp

on the side of using macros racket has always been more advanced than other scheme and lisp implementations

racket is closer to scheme than to common lisp but you could dip your toes into the lisp family without the speed bump of the emacs style of development


others
i would suggest you start with scheme and more specifically with racket formerly plt scheme

all of racket s languages can interoperate so your language of choice is up to you though the rnrs languages tend to go unused in the racket community #lang racket is much more useful for writing programs than any of the scheme implementations but they can be useful if you want to write programs that run on different scheme implementations

mit scheme is known for strong interactivitiy support while plt racket feels much more static

there are various object systems you can load as libraries when you want to do oop but integration with existing code heavily depends on the scheme dialect and its surrounding culture chicken scheme seems to be more object-oriented than racket for instance

racket and some other scheme implementations use a richer representation for syntax objects so that they can have properties attached to them indicating in racket at least what context they re bound in what source location they come from what pass of the compiler inserted them and any other information you might want to store cf


keras	tensorflow---------------------------------------------------

others
i suggest you to use keras i find it easier to use than tensorflow

keras provides a simpler quicker way to build and train models in tensorflow at no performance cost since the models are still being run by the same tensorflow engine

i created the exact same network with native and backend tensorflow but after many hours of testing using number of different parameters still couldn t figure out why keras outperforms the native tensorflow and produces better slightly but better results

it is similar in spirit to keras which is built as a high-level api on top of theano tensorflow cntk although the main difference is that lasagne implements only one backend allowing it to integrate more deeply with theano features


slower gpu equivalent
more than this methodology i would suggest to you to do the training directly in keras as it claimed that keras optimizers are 5-10 times faster than tensorflow s optimizers

is keras consumes more gpu memory than equivalent tensorflow model training

is keras faster slower than tensorflow during training


qtabwidget	qwidget---------------------------------------------------

others
meanwhile in another form i have a toogle button to hide qwidget so my qtabwidget get wider


map	quadtree---------------------------------------------------

others
note that a quadtree can be queried very quickly and efficiently but updates are a bit more costly that is if your items move a lot across your map this becomes more complicated to do with a good performance


pexpect	telnetlib---------------------------------------------------

others
i got it to work by using a child process from pexpect which is much more flexible than telnetlib


entities	entitymanager---------------------------------------------------

others
i know i worked with annotations to improve my entities to create a postgresql database and tables with correct behavior and modified my config file to use entitymanager to have more control over which tables tables to create but i don t know if that error comes from there as i use doctrine annotations in these entities files

each breeze entitymanager stores a single copy of each entity by key so memory use should not expand unless you are retrieving more entities or using more than one entitymanager.

when hibernate s entitymanager is tracking 100 000 entities it is 100x slower than when it is tracking only a few see results below


settings.bundle	plist---------------------------------------------------

others
on this screen you can see on the left site the root.plist with the childnode item for the additional plist file called more.plist which is located within the settings.bundle in xcode


mouseover	mousedown---------------------------------------------------

others
this may make for various race conditions and may necessitate using events which give you earlier notification than mouseup mousedown mouseenter mouseleave mouseover mouseout

mouseover rather than on mousedown makes it easier to catch moving


srp	ocp---------------------------------------------------

others
if they are internal then it s debatable whether it violates ocp or not but the violation of srp is even worse anyway


picasso	android-query---------------------------------------------------

others
android-query is better than picasso because while in offline mode no internet connectivity picasso tries to fetch record form server whereas android-query maintains its cache form where it fetched the images

if picasso doesn t satisfy you for any reason you can also try android-query which does much more than picasso it s not only for images but the same rules apply


dokuwiki	pmwiki---------------------------------------------------

others
i like dokuwiki but pmwiki might be better for you


qtableview	qabstractitemmodel---------------------------------------------------

others
how can i force a qabstractitemmodel to fetch more or up to a specific row and then force the qtableview to show it


express	node.js---------------------------------------------------

others
however unless you want to write some low-level node.js code to better understand this language i highly recommend using node.js web framework such as express

i have a node.js app built using coffescript on express connect jade less

one could argue that a lighter framework such as sinatra if you re going to use ruby or something like bottle python or the javascript stack of node.js + express would be a better fit if you truly are just going to create a restful api + some landing pages but rails does this perfectly fine as well and has a lot of other functionality that will be available for you to grow into if the time ever comes

first its not a bad idea to use node.js to satisfy your requirement the uniqueness of node and added advantage compared to conventional technologies like apache-php is clearly explained in this following video why node.js is better .the notion of node being just used for advanced or complex applications is wrong you can use node for building applications which are very simple to anything of huge proportion.it would be a not so comfortable task for a node beginner to code without using any frameworks but by using this web application framework called express you need not code from scratch and its very easy to setup html pages using its simplified html templating language called jade and route requests also you can even use your html pages if you are not willing to use jade for rendering the views of your application .here are the series of tutorials which would help you tutorials on beginning with node.js basics of expressjs

so nginx will work for this purpose but if you have made a node.js app the core module http optionally paired with express would be a more natural choice of webserver

i found node.js and used it along with socket.io and express to create a faster chat application


fancybox	colorbox---------------------------------------------------

others
i ve had to replace lyebox with colorbox which is much faster and seemingly has less problems conflicting with other scripts lightbox fancybox and others wouldn t work for me


checkbox	dropdownlistfor---------------------------------------------------

others
i have investigated libs cq gui components authoring dialog dropdownshowhide clientlibs dropdownshowhide.js but it s not really fit for purpose given that this is specifically designed for hiding or showing fields based on value of dropdownlistfor and my attempts to modify it to allow similar funationality on a checkbox have been less than fruitful

so the values can be mapped with each list now by the property of checkbox you can select more than one checkbox unlike radio button so when such case comes the dropdownlistfor that is being populated on the basis of each checkbox selection now comes in a merged format like on selecting option 1 and option 2 both the list contains all the elements mapped to both further on de-selecting it comes back to unmerged state


ethernet	wireless---------------------------------------------------

others
if you are working on physical machine that has cable and wireless connectivity then you will have more than one ethernet adaptor choise


prawn	pdfkit---------------------------------------------------

others
i would have spent at least a full week using prawn and i got pdfkit working in less than a few hours

some options like pdfkit above and also wicked pdf will rely on an external tool like wkhtmltopdf to render existing html pages as pdfs whereas other options like prawn are more ruby native so it really depends on your situation which path your should take in your application


mp3	wav---------------------------------------------------

data frequency-domain pcm
if you ask if a uncompressed wav which contains pcm data is better than mp3 then yes but the question sometimes is how much this better really matters to the human ear and how much postprocessing you have to perform on that data

either way applying gain and or attenuation to time-domain sample data as in a wav file is much easier than trying to apply these effects to frequency-domain data as in an mp3 file


others
just like an mp3 or something wav is probably faster

it is likely that wav is using a more compressive codec such as mp3 or ogg internally

first don t use wav as it takes up too much memory mp3 is better

for using a fileformat i thought mp3 uses much less memory than wav because all the formats are based on wav but just compressed

question iâ m seeing some compromise in mp3 quality my converted mp3 is lower file size when compared to wav but my audio quality is little poor than wav wonder if i can increase the quality of the mp3 file

the quality difference between 16- and 32-bit wav files is nearly never audible to the human ear on most sound equipment and depending on the quality of the original mp3 will take up more space anyway

i understand that mp3 is much smaller but it has worst audio quality when is compared to wav files


smaller files ability
so when you convert a file from wav to mp3 you get a smaller file but you lose audio quality

now i assume you are worried your techno might not read a compressed mp3 which should be smaller than a wav from my memories

you should definitely pick mp3 because they are about 10x smaller than wav files of the same duration

ok i am new to audio with unity but despite reading all the unity posts regarding audio adding 2 short .wav clips i heard wav was smaller than mp3 to my app has added over 200mb

wav files are about 3 times larger than mp3 files so it would need 1.8gb additional space to do the conversion

if you are still having problems jdk 8 has the ability to play mp3 files which are significantly smaller than wav you may want to try this

thin	unicorn---------------------------------------------------

others
in production it is much better to use a more sophisticated server like phusion passenger or unicorn since they have better performance than thin mongrel or webrick

i m running unicorn which is about 40 faster than thin on celadon cedar

jruby support - unicorn s a better choice than thin but it doesn t support jruby


vim	gedit---------------------------------------------------

others
if you re just going to use vim the same way you use gedit don t bother - gedit is better than vim at being gedit

i don t know anything about except that it s more powerful than gedit but doesn t have the same feel as vim emacs

if you are on linux eg ubuntu you may try gedit for ease of use with some plug-ins but to handle very large files you re better off with vim

if vim seems too much by the moment i think that kate is better than gedit


swt	swing---------------------------------------------------

others
it api seems for me easier than swt you haven t got to manage disposing components by hand to prevent memory leaks you adding component to panel instead of constructing components with parent panel information former is closer to my previous experience...etc. native look and feel you can get in swing too overall performance is enough good swt should be faster because it s using native components of backed os - but is the performance gain really big pro

fixing bugs in swt is much harder than in swing most classes in swt are final or contain hostile checks in the constructor to make sure no one extends them the package is signed so you can t simply replace classes and so far i tried several times to compile swt from sources - and failed

keep in mind that the point of swt is to use native controls so if you desire the ability to completely customize your controls perhaps using swing would be a better option

even though i liked many design aspects of swt and it is simpler than swing imo swing is the one to learn because imo it has far far better documentation examples etc

swing is the weaker of the gui technologies relating to accessibility in java compared to swt at any rate

swt has a more platform-specific look about it but java ships with swing built-in there s no messing about with external libraries as with swt although the use of eclipse may make that much easier i still develop quite a bit of my stuff from the command line unfortunately

swt became slower than swing because it uses proxy to os widgets

swt community is smaller and it doesn t provide that many tools as swing does

i m not too eager for using swt though since i m more familiar with swing

if you want a java gui that actually looks nice well nicer than swing or awt then you want to check out swt from ibm

is swt faster than swing

swt is more simple to use than swing especially if this is your first ui

also swt is actually newer and more actively maintained than swing

due to that swt looks more native than awt swing


faster versions enough
as for swing vs swt netbeans gui considerably faster than eclipse.

swt is claimed to be faster than swing although in modern versions swing is also fast enough


different awt note
ps i m not set on swt if anybody thinks a different library technology such as swing awt is better

these two are completely different logically speaking and you should choose only one of them to go further with note that swt is more customizable and tries to combine the best from awt and swing while swing is more limited and uses the platform s native widgets


api uglier simpler
i find swt to be an uglier api than swing in general though but not really a deal breaker

having used it myself in my opinion it s also far nicer than swing in its api more like swt in that respect looks far nicer by default and far more flexible in what it allows you to do

give swt a go the api is a lot simpler than swing


easier application experience
in my opinion swing is easier to learn and to use but the results of swt are often nicer - you can often feel that a swing application behaves not completely right

it can be hard to get the layuots exact the way you want in swt it s usually easier in swing

so in my view using swing is simply easier unless you have more experience in swt

into swing application i like to avoid using it with swt but is its more easier its ok


subtraction	multiplication---------------------------------------------------

others
in t-sql unary minus is made to be the same priority as subtraction which is lower than multiplication

notice that by making the rule for contain the rule for this grammar makes sure all multiplication division operations occur lower in the parse tree than any addition subtraction

after much fuddling with the sparse matrix algorithm i realized that distributing the multiplication over the subtraction was dramatically more efficient

i don t know how it works but it s much more complex than addition subtraction or even multiplication

this subtraction operator occurs within the second brackets and so has a higher precedence than the multiplication

multiplication is slower than subtraction

it will be much slower i don t have benchmarks but i would guess at least an order of magnitude maybe more decimal will not benefit from any hardware acceleration and arithmetic on it will require relatively expensive multiplication division by powers of 10 which is far more expensive than multiplication and dividion by powers of 2 to match the exponent before addition subtraction and to bring the exponent back into range after multiplication division

as in title why is multiplication much faster than subtraction in this example

since multiplication has a higher precedence than subtraction you should subtract 0 to your digit character before multiplying it

addition and subtraction are slightly lower latency multiplication is the same

while multiplication normally works subtraction fails for higher values

put each token +- of final command string in a list maybe a binary tree works and sort that list to tell the calculator that division and multiplication has the highest priority in the mean time addition and subtraction has lower priority

in general multiplication is more costlier than subtraction right

subtraction is similar using subtraction of the base type and borrow instead of carry multiplication can be done with repeated additions very slow or cross-products faster and division is trickier but can be done by shifting and subtraction of the numbers involved the long division you would have learned as a kid

the only way it would be broken up differently would be if addition had a higher precedence than subtraction like multiplication does


greater return nothing
addition subtraction for the rectangular bound calculation is cheaper than multiplication

subtraction operations and usually significantly faster than multiplication and division

for floating point operations addition and subtraction are harder than multiplication and division so they may be slower or not again it depends on how much transistor real estate there is dedicated to the fpu

finally we all know that multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction so we can remove the extraneous parentheses so this turns into

the addition and subtraction are much more than multiplication and division

i know the basics division and multiplication higher than addition and subtraction but i would have to look up something more esoteric

multiplication division and modulo have the same precedence and they all have higher precedence than addition and subtraction

the intuition would say addition subtraction are faster than multiplication division but is that really correct

it is also possible to manipulate the inputs so that various parts of the calculation return 0 for addition or subtraction or 1 for multiplication or division to make testing easier but this only gets me so far

remember multiplication division and remainder operators are all higher precedence than subtraction

i don t understand why the division multiplication in c++ is so much slower than addition subtraction where the managed c# version is more reasonable to my expectations

multiplication has higher precedence than addition subtraction

division multiplication has higher precedence than addition subtraction and parentheses is required to do addition subtraction before multiplication division

typically operations like addition and subtraction are much faster in integer -- multiplication and division less so

multiplication and division operators have higher precedence than addition and subtraction in c++ same as in scientific notation

multiplication and division have higher priority than addition and subtraction

multiplication and division have a higher precedence than addition and subtraction

this is happening because the concatenation operator has a higher precedence than the addition or subtraction operators but multiplication and division have a higher precedence then concatenation

multiplication is more expensive than addition subtraction and division is more expensive still

apart from that multiplication is addition done more than once and division is subtraction done more than once

i don t think they have a natural precedence unlike say multiplication and division being of greater precedence than subtraction and addition because they can be built from subtraction and addition

indicates that multiplication and division have more precedence than sum and subtraction

in general you ll have more variation with multiplication and division than with addition and subtraction

integer multiplication division and modulo are much slower than integer addition and subtraction

to start with i need multiplication and division to take higher precedence than addition and subtraction

nothing follows the rule of multiplication and division having more precedence over addition and subtraction

the term is apparently not an exact measurement as it is clear that a double-precision floating-point operation is going to take longer than a single-precision one and multiplication and division are going to take longer than addition and subtraction

either way your example with the numeric expression would multiplying by 3 first because multiplication has higher precedence than addition or subtraction


xmlhttprequest	xdomainrequest---------------------------------------------------

others
the usage of xdomainrequest has been simplified from xmlhttprequest by having more events thrown with onload perhaps being the most important


jtds	mssql-jdbc---------------------------------------------------

others
both freetds and jtds support an older windows authentication scheme named ntlm while current versions of microsoft s jdbc driver for sql server mssql-jdbc no longer support that authentication mechanism


imagemagick	pillow---------------------------------------------------

others
there exists a simd fork of pillow which claims to have much better performance than imagemagick or plain pillow but there are no comparisons to opencv


ironruby	ironpython---------------------------------------------------

others
also i believe the ironruby team is smaller than the ironpython team

ironpython has had more time to focus on performance improvements but ironruby has made significant performance improvements as of late

however as things stand right now ironpython is much more mature and has much better performance than ironruby so you may prefer to use that


accessor	superclass---------------------------------------------------

others
if i have a bunch of fields in a parent class that all need to be inherited by subclassing is it better to have the subclassing nested in the superclass make the fields protected rather than private or use protected accessor


saas	iaas---------------------------------------------------

others
more sophisticated distinctions between iaas paas and saas are also described in quite a few topics here on stackoverflow for instance in what is saas paas and iaas


ienumerable	ienumerator---------------------------------------------------

others
while i generally agree with jon skeet s answer i have also come across a very few cases where working with ienumerator indeed seemed more appropriate than wrapping them in a once-only- ienumerable


fontfamily	font-size---------------------------------------------------

others
the actual visible size is determined by the font-size and to a lesser extend by the fontfamily

as for the slight overflow this could either be caused by the font-size being larger than the line-height or due to the fontfamily you are using

if the fontfamily is the chinese fonts you can set font-size to be bigger


cobertura	eclemma---------------------------------------------------

others
also forgot to mention junit testing framework and a great eclipse plugin eclemma for code coverage much better than cobertura ecobertura and easier to use and of course you can try maven as the other post mentionned or try ant as build tool


adc	uart---------------------------------------------------

others
the only problem is that when the mcu is transmitting data uart transmission interrupt has higher priority than the adc reading interrupt the adc is not sampling data hence there will be data loss sample rate is around 500 samples sec


calloc	malloc---------------------------------------------------

memset faster memory
it s conceivable that calloc could return address of memory location that is already pre-initialized with zeros thus it may be faster than malloc + memset combo

if end up using the memory anyway calloc is still faster than malloc and memset but the difference is not quite so ridiculous

i remember somewhere i have read that calloc is slower than malloc because calloc performs initialization to zero after performing memory allocation

this is an enormous amount of extra work and explains why calloc is faster than malloc and memset

assuming the total amount of memory being initialized in your two examples is the same allocating the memory with calloc might be faster than allocating the memory with malloc and then zeroing them out in a separate step especially if in the malloc case you zero the elements individually by iterating over them in a loop

calloc itself is slower than malloc because you have to spend some time to clear the contents of allocated memory

malloc might be faster than calloc on some implementations

malloc is faster since calloc initializes the allocated memory to contain all zeros

it would be better to use malloc over calloc unless we want the zero-initialization because malloc is faster than calloc

this means calloc can potentially be faster than calling malloc followed by memset since it can skip the memset if it knows it will already by zeroed

calloc does the same thing as malloc but initializes all bytes to zero -- useful when you want to insure all memory is initialized and only slightly slower than malloc

and is as far as i know faster than the combination of malloc and memset on the other hand malloc alone is faster than calloc

it takes a page off of the free_page_list updates mem_map zeroes the page and returns the physical address of the page. here s another post that explains it well and also explains why using calloc is better than malloc + memset

calloc is faster than malloc + memset because calloc knows that the mmap d pages are pre-zeroed and memset forces the allocation of physical ram

calloc does take longer than malloc because it has to zero out all the memory you asked for before giving it to you

also calloc is slower than malloc from operating system memory allocation perspective

my question is why is malloc + memset so much slower than calloc

malloc + memset is slower than calloc under certain conditions

one reason to use calloc over malloc plus memset is that calloc may be more efficient

actually calling memset after malloc is closer to calling calloc than the option you suggest

in terms of speed calloc is likely to be faster than malloc + memset if memory needs to be zeroed out

see also why malloc + memset is slower than calloc


others
calloc would be a better choice here as it is going to assign default 0 values whereas malloc will just allocate space having garbage values

edit i m not a java expert but i think that in java members of new array are initialized to 0 or null so calloc is more correct than malloc in my code

those answers was that calloc can allocate larger blocks than malloc can and etc

malloc is faster than calloc reason is that malloc processed single dimensional array to pointer format whereas calloc takes double dimensional array and before processed it converts to single dimensional array then to pointer format

the first calloc subsequently malloc has a longer execution time then

g_new and g_new0 both take the same arguments unlike malloc that takes less arguments than calloc

there s also no real point using calloc here - malloc would be more normal

for this reason since calloc uses two arguments of type size_t it can allocate bigger blocks than malloc will ever be able to since malloc takes only one argument of type size_t

malloc is far more common in c code than calloc


hard sensible better
as written malloc would be better than calloc but the question used calloc and it would not be hard to make it sensible for use with this code too for example a conditional assignment in set_matrix such as

in fact using calloc instead of malloc would be even better


free realloc thereâ
in this context free store is different and incompatible with heap because the new delete free store library is simpler and quicker than the malloc free realloc calloc heap library and thus provides huge memory usage gains to the c++ embedded programmer in a context where you have only 512 bytes of ram

malloc free is harder because thereâ s also calloc and realloc


qhash	qmap---------------------------------------------------

lookups values wirelessapdata
qhash is faster but qmap values are sorted by key if you iterate through them

qhash provides faster lookups than qmap

also i have changed the qmap to qhash to make it faster and wirelessapdata is just a struct


others
also with this method you could use different container for different dimensions like if you need one dimension to be sorted use qmap which is sorted by key for that and qhash which is more efficient for the dimension which doesn t need sorting

using qmap instead of qhash seems more reasonable as neox recommended on his comment


for-loop	if-statement---------------------------------------------------

others
this is little strange to me why if-statement is in this aspect treated worse than for-loop


spreadsheetml	presentationml---------------------------------------------------

others
the one thing to keep in mind is that spreadsheetml is more similiar to presentationml than it is to wordprocessingml in file structure inside the package for every sheet there is a seperate file


qtableview	qtreeview---------------------------------------------------

others
qtreeview is known for being slower than a qtableview and consume a lot of memory and you are using a plain table model anyways so try with a qtableview


cos	sin---------------------------------------------------

others
if i want to calculate a sin and a cos is it cheaper to calculate a sin and a cos or calculate a sin then a sqrt 1-sin 2 to get the cos

your conversion function results in very small values which for sin may not change the integer value of y and for cos result in larger values for x

or maybe flip them on my machine sin seems faster than cos

the taylor expansions of sin x and cos x takes longer to converge as x increases

3.14 is pretty close but a little smaller than pi and sin 3.14 is thus pretty close but a little bigger than 0 cos 3.14 is thus pretty close but a little smaller in absolute terms than -1 so tan 3.14 is a little less than 0

cos itself seems to be consistently a tick 0 01 better than sin but the case distinction to reconstruct the sign has an extra test

in this case sin will be much closer to 1 and cos much closer to 0

this requires computing cos theta and sin theta just once and then each update is given by a matrix multiplication of a 2x2 matrix with a 2-d vector and then a simple addition which is faster than computing sin using the power series expansion


printwriter	bufferedwriter---------------------------------------------------

others
printwriter is a richer api compared to bufferedwriter

i like to use bufferedwriter more than printwriter and its working with the bufferedwriter


fiddler	charles---------------------------------------------------

others
charles has a much better ui than fiddler


swift	objective-c---------------------------------------------------

others
swift won t allow you to do absolutely everything that objective-c does but it will allow you to do almost everything and the code will be probably more robust considering that swift is more modern language with stronger typing than objective-c

i also use objective-c more than swift but here s what my guess is as to what the objective-c code would come to

those attributes let you create objective-c code which is more understandable by swift and complier warn you when you break the rule for example

for example exposing the students property in swift means different places can all modify it and the delegate would be notified also it s not clear to the coder that setting students property would trigger a delegate notification for averagescore whereas having a dedicate method in objective-c makes it more clear

swift comparing to objective-c has it s own benefits like swift handles strings more easily swift tuples offer compound variables and also coders don t need to spend time annotating variables with type information and risk making mistakes

any swift corrections are more than welcome i m still an objective-c guy for now

it al has to do with pointers which were very present in objective-c but are much more hidden in swift

the swift designers went through a lot of trouble to make sure that it s more than just objective-c without the constraints of c in fact i almost wish they hadn t said that since it s so often misquoted

in my limited experience using objective-c code from swift is a more common use-case and fairly trivial

objective-c blocks and swift closures are more than loose equivalents

edit although this answer works it is little more than objective-c transliterated into swift

but swift is less dynamically typed than objective-c and has less support for reflection

swift is clearer on versions releases and i keep asking myself if i am missing something related to objective-c since i can t find this information

objective-c -documentary provides more content than the documentary for swift

after reading some related articles i don t think swift is more effective than objective-c

however when i switch to swift 4.0 the methods declared in swift is no longer visible in objective-c

i n the long term every objective-c interface ought to be explicitly annotated so that swift can import them more precisely

while i think the move to swift is prudent but i think it overstates the case to argue that swift is significantly more secure that objective-c

specifically it makes it possible to write objective-c code that plays nicely with swift which is more strongly typed than objective-c

no objects come magically into existence in swift any more than in objective-c

swift seems to be less dynamic than objective-c in these stuffs

java tends to be much more verbose than swift so i doubt what i m asking is too broad it is more likely that i don t know how to use the objective-c messagecomposer object because the documentation that i linked to above is unclear with regard to usage in swift

swift is more strictly typed than objective-c

in swift as objective-c there is far less emphasis on subclassing than other languages

the swift runtime is smaller than the objective-c runtime

as you can see the swift example is more complex and error prone than your objective-c code

i find that objective-c is much nicer for working with core audio than swift

i saw this swift vs objective-c and it does lead me to believe that swift is more accurate in terms of timing that objective c but i wanted to make sure that was accurate

you will notice that swift bundles are always about 4-5 mb larger than their objective-c counterparts and this is precisely why

i m writing some swift 1.2 code that calls an objective-c library transcribing some earlier objective-c code

self is a type constraint not an actual type. this is a side effect of the type system in swift being much more strict and static than that of objective-c for example metatypes aren t just a special flavor of otherwise normal objects

i know that swift is buggy as heck i run into bugs everyday but ill bet objective-c was even worse when it started out benefits of hindsight so in a couple of years swift will be equal or greater than objective-c keeping its basic simplicity as well

one of the reasons we want to move is because swift is more secure than objective-c

however i suspect i m having a larger issue with using objective-c interfaces with extensions in a swift project or my understanding of how that works

so it should have always been gkagent under objective-c in order to be strictly correct however objective-c is less type-safe than swift so you could get away with it with the possibility that you d get an unrecognized selector exception if a gkagent object was ever passed to the delegate method and you assumed it was a gkagent2d

swift will incur this penalty in fewer situations than objective-c will for instance method calls to swift-only protocol methods do not hit objc_msgsend but if the protocol is declared in objective-c or if the swift protocol is decorated with objective-c such that it can be adopted by objective-c objects as well then method calls to methods in that protocol adopted by swift objects appear to be dispatched via objc_msgsend

furthermore swift is stricter than objective-c when it comes to initialisers

this is because the swift dictionary is more strongly typed than the objective-c nsdictionary

adding lightweight generics to your objective-c api makes it easier to interface with swift because your api gets translated more precisely

may be because vvcospif it is wrapper under objective-c runtime and converting data structures copying of memory from intel simd - objective-c - swift runtime is slower then tiny cos

with objective-c i was able to catch all the exceptions thrown by the parser found on github but with swift we are no more allowed to do so and therefore my question

personally i prefer objective-c because you can use c very easily as anything that is legal in c is also legal in objective-c added to which swift is a more procedural in style where objective-c is quite clearly object orientated

objective-c has been updated to enable it and swift to work together more easily and efficiently


type stricter dynamic
apple seems to claim that the optional type in swift is safer than nil in objective-c but i don t understand why this is so

while objective-c was good at dynamic type inspection swift is much better of you allow the compiler to do the type checking at compile time

i feel swift is better than objective-c in many aspects but my major question is - will swift dynamic libraries support older version of swift

objective-c is much more free and easy with types and compilation checks where swift isn t

swift is stricter about runtime type correctness than objective-c so duck typing alone is not enough

objective-c s relatively lax type checking makes this easy to deal with but swift is stricter


readable print
with swift the code is much more readable than with objective-c

objective-c print is more readable compared to swift


use
also note that i use objective-c more than swift

i use objective-c more than swift


better easier familiar
i m more familiar with objective-c than swift and haven t had a chance to test this yet but this should be close

swift is lot smarter than objective-c about singleton class

swift in that case would not be safer but less safe than objective-c

swift also prevents us i believe from overriding a parent class s property but also still lets us observe changes to that property--this is much better than objective-c s approach

i don t know objective-c all that well and swift would be an easier transition i feel

better if you have a code swift is better but is not problem objective-c

usually i find swift s method naming to be cleaner than objective-c s but init methods can be an exception

so in swift just as in objective-c you had better make that delegate property weak because it would be terrible if one view controller suddenly took memory management ownership of another view controller

on the other hand swift is easier to learn especially if you have objective-c background so it can be adopted during the time slowly and paralelly with using objective-c

this article seems to suggest that this is possible by swizzling a fake location into apple s cllocationmanager class to be used by other apps but i am unfamiliar with the objective-c code more familiar with swift

in case it s helpful since you seem perhaps more familiar with objective-c than swift here s what your swift method would look like if we translated it back into objective-c

i know that swift enums are much more powerful than their objective-c equivalents

enumerations in swift 2 are much better then in objective-c

as you can see defining a singleton class in swift is much easier than in objective-c

early this month i started learning swift as i found it fun and easier than objective-c

i suppose it sort of makes sense to do things this way except for the fact that metal appears to play better with objective-c even though it looks like swift

so i ve started learning swift because it looks way better than objective-c

after thinking about playing with it some more and reading some other posts using objective-c typedef in swift here is a better solution i think

it seems to me that swift would be way simpler to learn then objective-c for beginners i know because i learned it in like 2 months and swift is less complicated and better laid out then objective-c

swift is neither easier to read nor understand than objective-c

we ve seen that swift uses a more static method dispatch than objective-c which unless a class dervices from foundation nsobject prevents the style of swizzling based on remapping method implementations at runtime

then the buffers won t need to be treated as arrays of pointers and passing arrays of say floats between objective-c ++ and swift is easier

i would be very interested in seing the solution in objective-c also but swift is more important for me here

note that swift s arrays are much more sensible than objective-c s

i m learning swift and much less familiar with objective-c but for the life of me i can t figure out how they are trying to achieve the goal stated as build list of encodings sorted and including only those with human readable names.

but we can assume that generics in objective-c were introduced for transitioning to swift and in that regard using swift directly is even better

i m trying to make the conversion from objective-c to swift and have had better days


applications macos structs
writing swift 2.0 in my professional work my personal opinion is that it s indeed ready for enterprise applications -- maybe even more than objective-c ever were

as objective-c is the older programming language for ios or macos applications swift allows you to use those classes structs in your code


faster slower things
most importantly for your image processing app the compiler will optimize swift code to run faster than objective-c

still technically yes it appears that an all swift solution is roughly 2x slower than a swift + cocoa solution which should be roughly the same than objective-c + cocoa when compiled with equivalent options iirc

if you are using something like paintcode or have large chunks of uikit code in swift change it to objective-c it compiles far faster

the swift one is dramatically slower then objective-c implementation

some esoteric things you are used to with objective-c are harder to implement with swift

i don t think that as of today you can run these tests and determine with any certainty whether swift 1.0 is faster or slower than objective-c

the swift compiler is doing a lot more and is quite a bit newer than the objective-c compiler so it unlikely it will be as stable fast for quite some time

fwiw the objective-c compiler also mangles names but swift s mangling is more intricate to allow for method overloading etc

swift s compiler is also doing a lot more than objective-c s compiler considering swift is more strongly typed and does not required specifying imports among other things

there are multiple reasons why the swift code is slower than the objective-c code

wouldn t swift be slower than objective-c in this case since it is layered on top of it

i have tried many things already changing up a few things wrote in swift differently alternatively using a for instead of the built in contains in swift to see if that might be the problem but objective-c was still faster

my view is that if in some cases objective-c is faster than swift it doesn t mean that all over performance of swift is slower

and also apple does might not confidently announce that swift is more faster than objective-c in all the cases

injecting code in a swift application is harder than it was for an objective-c application but it s still possible

i have a objective-c application working fine and smooth to be more comfortable with swift i decided to write the unit tests for this app in swift

it is possible for swift to be faster than pure objective-c in things that you would traditionally use c or c++ for anyway

as craig revealed within the announcement of swift it is said to be faster than objective-c by far

the perf hit will be ridiculous i know apple say swift execute faster than objective-c but this is low level so it will be harmless

bottom line i would personally hesitate to draw any simple conclusions of swift is faster than objective-c or vice versa

as mentioned in the comments although its possible to use objective-c libraries in swift i wanted a more pure swift solution

executable size of swift application is much bigger than size of objective-c application


syntax clearer wise
i m just adding this below in objective-c to make it clearer to beginners and those of us who refuse to learn swift syntax

however i read that swift was the successor of objective-c and i would feel more comfortable with swift syntax

im new to swift but i like it more than objective-c as it looks a bit like java does to me from syntax wise compared to objective-c


deselect	multi-select---------------------------------------------------

others
hold down ctrl and click to multi-select or do ctrl + a to select all and then deselect the ones you don t want with ctrl + shift +click


scipy	sympy---------------------------------------------------

others
another even simpler option than canopy and anaconda is just to download spyder s dmg which comes with the latest versions of numpy scipy matplotlib pandas sympy and the sci-kits

first of all if it was not for the relative complexity of the expressions here scipy would have been definitely the better option over sympy


getdate	dateadd---------------------------------------------------

others
case cast convert current_timestamp dateadd datediff datename datepart getdate isdate left len lower ltrim replace replicate reverse right rtrim space str substring substring expression start length sysdatetime upper

the logic could be a sql agent job that is fired every 24 hours that deletes any data that has a datetime less than dateadd d -1 getdate


imageview	imageswitcher---------------------------------------------------

others
if you still have problems with your imageview inside imageswitcher taking more space than needed try to peek at the imageview with the hierarchyviewer in the sdk tools


qstyleditemdelegate	qitemdelegate---------------------------------------------------

others
qstyleditemdelegate is newer and the qt documentation about qitemdelegate states that


virtualenv	setuptools---------------------------------------------------

others
development and deployment of python code is made much easier by setuptools in combination with virtualenv and pip


treeview	expander---------------------------------------------------

others
i wish expanding any expander make my treeview control resize to smaller size


mfcc	spectrogram---------------------------------------------------

others
the most commonly used is called mfcc mel-frequency cepstrum which you can think of as a improved spectrogram retaining more relevant information to discriminate between classes


d3.js	leaflet---------------------------------------------------

others
i was thinking of generating tiles to serve to openlayers or leaflet for display but my data has a graph structure that i would like to take advantage of and i think using neo4j possibly in combination with a visualization library like d3.js may be an easier way to build my tool

i think d3.js looks so much better than leaflet but for quick zooming panning functionality my first question is is this better off in leaflet or can d3.js handle slick zoom pan even though it s not tile-based

d3.js is not wrong the data is incorrect and leaflet is more lenient


nstextview	nstextstorage---------------------------------------------------

others
the nstextview process is much simpler as you only need to attach the nstextstorage object


mousemove	mousedown---------------------------------------------------

others
how can i change the handler so it only fires when the distance of mousemove between mousedown and mouseup is less than a fixed value


notepad++	scite---------------------------------------------------

others
by the way if you like minimalistic approach there is also scite editor which is my personal preference for doing small bits of code it s even more lightweight than notepad++


datatrigger	eventtrigger---------------------------------------------------

others
i think datatrigger instead of eventtrigger is more suitable and you need to use x type to specify the bound data to the item


concurrenthashmap	readwritelock---------------------------------------------------

others
the other question why not use a concurrenthashmap here since it will provide some concurrent writes to different mapentries and provide more concurrency than readwritelock


matplotlib	colormap---------------------------------------------------

others

endpoints data values
to allow you to scale down the data away from 0 and 1 i had to do this when combining colormap in matplotlib single pcolormesh with more than one colormap using matplotlib so you can likely see how the code works but basically say you have values -5 1 10 in a sample but want to normalize based on a range of -7 to 7 so anything above 7 our 10 is treated as a 7 effectively with a midpoint of 2 but shrink it to fit a 256 rgb colormap

to allow you to scale down the data away from endpoints 0 and 1 i had to do this when combining colormap in matplotlib single pcolormesh with more than one colormap using matplotlib so you can likely see how the code works but basically say you have values -5 1 10 in a sample but want to normalize based on a range of -7 to 7 so anything above 7 our 10 is treated as a 7 effectively with a midpoint of 2 but shrink it to fit a 256 rgb colormap


exponent	addition---------------------------------------------------

others

powers little clearer
it will be much slower i don t have benchmarks but i would guess at least an order of magnitude maybe more decimal will not benefit from any hardware acceleration and arithmetic on it will require relatively expensive multiplication division by powers of 10 which is far more expensive than multiplication and dividion by powers of 2 to match the exponent before addition subtraction and to bring the exponent back into range after multiplication division

in addition for doing powers of two bitshifting is usually a little clearer than doing exponent though choose whatever works for you


instance largerexp-smallerexp mathematica
for instance to achieve addition you would scale the larger value to have the same exponent as the smaller one by multiplying it by 10 largerexp-smallerexp then adding the two values and rescaling

in addition since all my coefficients are positive and i only want the x qth one is there a way to get mathematica to discard all exponent that are larger than that and not do all the multiplication with those


result mantissa operands
if the exponent are more different than the size of the mantissa then addition or subtraction you get the number with the larger exponent as the result all the bits of the smaller number have shifted off into the bit bucket n + 0 n - 0

since fp addition shifts the smaller operand s mantissa until both operands have the same exponent you can add a certain magic number to force it

in the default to-nearest rounding mode the mathematical result of the addition would have to be above the middle point between double.maxvalue and the next floating-point value that could be represented if the exponent range was wider for the floating-point result to round up to infinity


cout	cin---------------------------------------------------

little situations practical
using printf isn t faster than cout but scanf is a little faster than cin 0.04s + - 0.05

scanf is faster than cin printf is faster than cout etc

there are obviously situations where in c++ scanf is preferable to cin i was wondering if there are any situations where printf is more practical than cout


others
allow for the possibility that there may be any number of whitespace characters one or more between cin and and between cout and

for the purposes of reading the user s input i would recommend using std cin which uses a similar syntax to std cout and is really more convenient


emacs	sublimetext---------------------------------------------------

others
this is the one thing i think sublimetext does better than emacs

though it is more or less similar to sublimetext 2 s monokai there are some differences which i want to correct so as get my emacs monokai more close to sublimetext s monokai


getchar	getline---------------------------------------------------

others
getline is probably better than getchar in most cases


testdriven.net	xunit.net---------------------------------------------------

others
one option is to install testdriven.net which makes it easier to run unit tests on any of the major unit testing .net frameworks nunit xunit.net vs tools etc


reportlab	xhtml2pdf---------------------------------------------------

others
this isn t to say that xhtml2pdf is bad just that it s going to take time for it to be as good as rendering in a browser and if pdf output for its own sake is what you really are interested in i think using reportlab directly is a better choice


lwjgl	jogl---------------------------------------------------

others
i think lwjgl has a implementation too but the jogl one is better

jogl is more java-like whereas lwjgl provides more gaming functionality on top of opengl access

lwjgl is much more aimed towards gaming with opengl where as jogl is more worried about complete and perfect bindings to opengl opencl

if your company s concern is to avoid big unknown libraries which is prefectly understandable i d advise you to stick with lwjgl which is smaller that jogl


libsvm	liblinear---------------------------------------------------

others
and how do the differences make liblinear faster than libsvm

liblinear is considered faster than linear libsvm and often used for large scale data set

and i ve read that using liblinear is far faster more memory efficient for such tasks as such i ve ported my libsvm classifier to accord net like so

you can also try sklearn.linear_model.logisticregression and sklearn.svm.linearsvc both implemented using liblinear that is more scalable than libsvm albeit less memory efficients than other linear models in scikit-learn


asterisk	pbx---------------------------------------------------

others
i need a sip server hopefully simpler more efficient and more secure than asterisk or other full-featured pbx to just terminate sip calls and play audio based on the incoming number


namenode	hdfs---------------------------------------------------

others
since the namenode is a single-point-of-failure in hdfs it requires a more reliable hardware setup

hdfs high availabilty is only available when you have more than one namenode configured

it s almost always suggested that each file in hdfs be much larger than the block size to increase the likelihood of a process reading a full block and to reduce namenode memory contention

it s a more involved process with namenode assuring that at least dfs.replication.min copies are written to hdfs


openfire	ejabberd---------------------------------------------------

others
this server side product was openfire but you could use ejabberd for even better performance - openfire is easier to set up and maintain though

we are currently using ejabberd but prosody or openfire are perhaps better alternatives


gtk	motif---------------------------------------------------

others
gtk and qt are two of the most common ones these days but there are others such as motif which is older and doesn t look as nice


freebsd	netbsd---------------------------------------------------

others
but freebsd dragonfly bsd and netbsd define issetugid more strictly

iirc freebsd s benchmarks returned consistent results under any load whereas netbsd started off quicker and gradually got slower


tlistview	tlistbox---------------------------------------------------

others
i know tlistbox renders like this but i require the use of tlistview for the data property also the tlistview handles icons better via a timagelist

depending on your actual needs which you did not explain a multi-column tlistview in vsreport mode may be a better choice than a tlistbox


strtok	malloc---------------------------------------------------

others
i ve also tried malloc -ing more memory after every call to strtok but nothing seems to fix the seg fault


actionlistener	focuslistener---------------------------------------------------

others
create the text field and register the documentlistener to it...although i d be wary about using a documentlistener personally maybe a actionlistener and or focuslistener might be more suitable but hay


ocaml	scheme---------------------------------------------------

others
i personally believe that it is not worth the effort because basic is a nearly dead language and there are lots of languages better than basic ocaml haskell common lisp clojure scala scheme go d ...


tstringlist	tlist---------------------------------------------------

others
i believe it is much much faster than using tlist descendant or tstringlist


wav	caf---------------------------------------------------

others
and as justin said i do believe that wav will be the better option as you can have more support for wav than the caf format

2 caf seems a little better than wav but not much


fileoutputstream	bufferedwriter---------------------------------------------------

others
for a few bytes passed in just one call probably the bufferedwriter is even worse because it problably later calls fileoutputstream


getlasterror	findwindow---------------------------------------------------

others
if findwindow fails a call to getlasterror after the call to findwindow may give you more information


fgetc	fread---------------------------------------------------

others
you might have even noticed the fgetc version is simpler than the fread version


requirement single variant
there is no requirement that fgetc be any slower at retrieving a block of bytes than fread

doing things like 1000 successive fgetc is much slower than doing one single fread of 1000 bytes

the fgetc loop variant was consistently 45x slower than the fread loop


singleton	facade---------------------------------------------------

others
can any one tell me which one is better between session facade class and singleton object design patterns in asp.net


git-rebase	amend---------------------------------------------------

others
you can use an interactive git-rebase in stead of an amend and edit an earlier commit


distance	pdist---------------------------------------------------

others
pdist implementation was always slower than cython and takes much more memory because it explicitly creates a distance matrix which is slow because of sqrt

also note that in my code above manually calculating the euclidean distance is much faster then calling pdist


cakephp	yii---------------------------------------------------

smaller higher frameworks
yii has a higher learning curve than say codeigniter and cakephp

if you employ php frameworks like codeigniter yii maybe even cakephp which have comparatively smaller learning curves you will find your path wellpaved for you in php


others
tried cakephp but yii seems much clearer

i am currently looking at yii and while its more complex than codeigniter the documentation is much more informative and therefore understandable than cakephp s

cakephp is sweet too but yii have more things and is more advanced


gruntjs	browserify---------------------------------------------------

others
while gulp gruntjs is very popular for build automation which includes bundling all dependent javascript in file and minifying them in to one file webpack browserify is a better option as it supports module import


lasagne	keras---------------------------------------------------

others
if everything is correct why keras perform so much better than lasagne

as a result of this comparison i see that lasagne is performing so much worse than keras that i m starting to doubt about my code

it is similar in spirit to keras which is built as a high-level api on top of theano tensorflow cntk although the main difference is that lasagne implements only one backend allowing it to integrate more deeply with theano features


buttonclick	clicklistener---------------------------------------------------

others
if you need more than a simple method call you could just as well create a more elaborate clicklistener implementation that has more than the buttonclick method


fuzzy	stemming---------------------------------------------------

others
stemming gives better performance than fuzzy search because it is done when indexing and the actual search can be performed as exact match


sqldf	plyr---------------------------------------------------

others
in the first example sqldf is 3x slower than data.table and in the second its 200x faster than plyr and 100 times faster than data.table


tripledes	aes---------------------------------------------------

others
but tripledes is older and weaker than aes

tripledes is generally not recommended because aes gives better security more efficiently you might like to see some comparative timings of block ciphers that i took in java to see just how bad it is

i personally would use aes for my encryption as it is lighter and more secure than tripledes in fact i think it is the de facto algorithm at the moment


quaqua	substance---------------------------------------------------

others
comparative to other themes of swing sysnthetica substance etc. quaqua theme takes more memory


pdfbox	pdflib---------------------------------------------------

others
edit 31 march 2014 for what it s worth i have found that pdfbox is much better at text extraction than itextsharp notwithstanding a bespoke strategy implementation and pdflib tet is slightly better than pdfbox but it s quite expensive


odoo	qweb---------------------------------------------------

others
qweb is nicer templating tool and it was created by odoo and its designed to work cross language originally which can be forked from git - qweb


pandas	dask---------------------------------------------------

others
this may help those confused by dask and hdf5 but more familiar with pandas like myself

1 i guess dask will be slower than pandas for smaller datasets

pandas is far more flexible for working with data so i often bring parts of dask dataframes into memory manipulate columns and create new ones

when hdf5 storage can be accessed fast than .csv and when dask creates dataframes faster than pandas why is dask from hdf5 slower than dask from csv


symfony	silex---------------------------------------------------

others
also take a look at silex as this has lower overhead than symfony and works with symfony forms

in my case i needed speed right out of the box and silex provided me with the speed and although i am using most of the symfony components it is a lot faster than symfony out of the box

that is for symfony so not sure if silex has some better sugar


rtp	rtsp---------------------------------------------------

others
http streaming servers will in most cases use tcp as their network transport rtsp servers usually offer rtp over udp which is more suited to multimedia streaming where some errors packet loss can be tolerated with the benefit of lower latency and less network overheads

the strange thing is that when streaming is done via rtsp unicast rtcp generates both sender reports and receiver reports but when streaming is done via rtp multicast only sender reports are generated

i think you re confusing rtp over http with rtsp over http and therefore rtp too see for more info

rtsp is more of a handshake done with the server while rtp is the actual stream coming in once the handshake is done and you start streaming


distance	polygons---------------------------------------------------

points point original
notes the width of the polygons cannot be fixed as you realize because at articulation points the distance will be larger

root punto is a valid geojson point i checked it with the st_isvalid function and also if i use the function st_distance checking if the distance between the point and the polygons is greater than zero the data retrieved is correct but i don t know if this approach is correct

to answer your original question as to how to generate the smaller polygons you can find the centroid of each polygons and offset each vertex by a percentage of the distance to that centroid point of the polygons to get the smaller polygons


others
testing the distance between rectangles is easier than testing the distance between polygons and you can immediately eliminate any polygons that are more than nearest_rect + its_diagonal away possibly you can refine that even more

plenty of others don t use a delimiter at all and require you to start a new segment polygons if you re more than x distance away from the last point. furthermore these things often wind up being multi-gb ascii files so reading the entire thing into memory can be impractical

- for example if you call avgd the average distance beetween points you could add the constraint that no segment of your outer polygons should be longer than 1.2 avgd or better alpha avgd and you try your algorithm with different alpha

that the distance when the route is confined to the polygons should be greater in this case 5.00

create a buffer with a negative distance to get a smaller polygons with the shape of the original

the one drawback is that distance between vertices might be slightly less intuitive than polygons area but the two are proportional

then i would simply check the edges of all blue polygons whose lower bound of distance is lower than the upper bound of minimal distance against all the edges of the red polygons


radius magnitude special
calculate the actual minimum distance and continue through the sorted list until the maximum distance between the polygons is greater than the minimum distance found so far

if the magnitude of the distance between the center of the circle and the center of the polygons is less than the radius of the circle the polygons intersects

if that distance is less than the radius of the circle then you know that the polygons intersects the circle

does the polygons encompass the circle this is that special case where the distance from all of the sides of the polygons would be greater than the circle s radius but the circle and polygons still obviously intersect


udp	rtp---------------------------------------------------

others
for those packets that are udp and between the two rtp ports grabbed earlier fuzz the rtp contents

http streaming servers will in most cases use tcp as their network transport rtsp servers usually offer rtp over udp which is more suited to multimedia streaming where some errors packet loss can be tolerated with the benefit of lower latency and less network overheads

so that your rtp over udp becomes more resistant towards packets losses

media goes over udp using higher-layer protocols like rtp real-time transport protocol and this part of communication typically goes peer-to-peer


google-chrome	safari---------------------------------------------------

better numbers text
basically the way google-chrome renders text looks ugly and i want it to look like or almost like firefox or safari which looks thinner and better

firefox google-chrome opera and safari all handle it better

i think safari renders the moves better than google-chrome

i guess firefox and safari handle huge numbers of elements better than google-chrome

safari comes in at just under 41ms performing better than google-chrome but still not great


problems browsers hover
now i recognized that safari make more problems then the other browsers like google-chrome or firefox

please especially test on safari because it has some more problems than firefox and google-chrome

on all of the other browsers i ve tried safari opera ie google-chrome it looks much less nice because all of those browsers scroll half a screen at a time

it seems to work fine in google-chrome but in safari it causes some hover issues on links


api error job
this seems to me like a bandwidth error or something like that originally i ve got the error when i played with the html 5 audio api and if i loaded the audio file 10-15 times sequentially then i ve got the error but now i ve discovered that i get the error without the audio api too just by reloading the site a lots of times also safari gives me the error much faster than google-chrome wtf

google-chrome also is susceptible to this same issue although it does a significantly better job than safari at getting the realtime api re-connected


version older current
according to w3counter ie6 is used by more people than opera safari and any version of google-chrome

browsers devices desktop browsers ie8+ google-chrome firefox safari ipad s browser mobile safari mobile devices browsers android mobile safari

it worked perfectly with google-chrome but safari 5 and firefox implement a more recent version of the websocket protocol and cramp does not so i couldn t get it to work there

it s not even a webkit issue unless google-chrome s got a newer version than safari

safari still uses the older version while google-chrome uses a more current one

google-chrome also uses an earlier version of webkit than the current safari so pages should be checked in both browsers

it also gets broken even more in ios google-chrome which is an older version of safari

well unless you re targeting older than google-chrome 1.0 firefox 8.0 ie 4.0 opera 7.0 or safari 4.0 it s safe to use insertadjacenthtml


harder wrong json
dus anyone knows if there is something wrong with my json or if google-chrome is harder to get than safari

headers copied from google-chrome only since safari is harder to copy paste from


ios slower faster
my ipad 1 safari js benchmarked 38 times slower than google-chrome on my pc

if i try to do a google search for website loading slower in google-chrome than in safari i get a lot of results about how safari is slower than google-chrome

this makes firefox 50x faster than google-chrome and 70x faster than safari is there any known reason for that

in fact given that google rejected pointer event on the ground of speed which ie solved by gpu acceleration it can be said that google-chrome and webkit in general - safari is even slower is lagging behind on this front and the only way to help is contributing code to chromium webkit

why would the mobile google-chrome browser be so less performant than ios safari browser and very similiar hardware

if you use the share button on the xcode documentation window to open the page in a web browser i had much better luck with safari than google-chrome 31 you can click on the mac ios developer library link in the top left corner of the webpage

edit what particularly interrests me is if desktop safari is closer to ios safari than google-chrome is

it is only slow with google-chrome browser safari is much faster

since the fixed position in general is not all that stable on touch some more than others google-chrome works great it is still acting up in safari ios 8 in situations that used to work in ios 7 therefore i generally just use js to detect touch devices including windows mobile

it defaults to safari on my machine but i d like it to use google-chrome as the development tools in google-chrome are better

i think it s simply because google-chrome firefox safari etc. are faster browsers

because of how google-chrome s plugin system works development mode in google-chrome is much slower than in firefox or safari see here for more details

conclusion diff1 is faster in firefox opera and safari diff2 is faster in ie and google-chrome

the one used by google-chrome and is slower than mobile safari s nitro javascript engine

okay safari ios is more strict than google-chrome android when it comes to this all fine but it still needs to enable me to allow the connection through

the browser does not matter though safari gets way more consistently working results than google-chrome


wider menu selector
the html tables on my site look nice and the way i intend them to in safari firefox google-chrome but look far wider than the set pixel size in ie

solved the problem came from css specificity.bootstrap s css was judged more specific by google-chrome regarding my menu s selector but not by firefox and safari

in safari the background of my menu navigation drop-down menu s is much wider than in google-chrome firefox


values cells
this happens in firefox and also in google-chrome cells shrink less in google-chrome but not in safari

it appears that google-chrome can handle more values at the moment but safari can t


others
google-chrome has more of the market than safari not and invitation for flame wars just a personal opinion without any weight -

i planned on using svgs for the entire site but with only 20-30 svg images of medium to high complexity used in the page and google-chrome already seems to be showing som jank and high paint times for scroll and firefox is even worse though safari seems to do a lot better

safari and opera work with the google-chrome setting but firefox and ie display the iframed page larger than google-chrome causing part of the text to be cut off

the compatibility table link shows google-chrome firefox edge and safari are more compatible than babel now

i tried to use jquery and the scroll event it s working on google-chrome but not on safari and is definitely less smooth than on the example

i found out that with any opacity not text color alpha less than 1.0 google-chrome gave me good results but safari was still bad.

the only thing is that flexbox is not supported by older browser support by ie10+ google-chrome 20+ safari 3.1+ firefox 2+ read more about support so i probably would need to add the flexie polyfill to support this on older browser

for comparison 0.68 usage means this outdated google-chrome release is more popular than the current and previous versions of opera the penultimate version of safari on ios and ie 9 or 10

as you can see here a friend of mine did some testing and it seems that google-chrome and ie work a lot faster with the dot syntax while firefox and safari are more keen on the key syntax

a lot of people use iphones ipads and safari is literally the only option even google-chrome is more like safari in disguise... so it s quite a portion of users who are suffering from this issue

ios google-chrome is more ios safari than google-chrome itself

how can i get mobile safari to handle hover events like the android version of google-chrome

safari renders open sans bolder than in google-chrome so you would need to apply a lighter font weight for safari open sans google web fonts rendering in google-chrome

works in google-chrome firefox a bit weirdish blur effect on hover opera ends look smaller safari ends look smaller

in safari it renders significantly brighter than in firefox or google-chrome

the safari controller bar is the quicktime bar which is smaller and dark so the movement is less noticeable than google-chrome which has a big blue progress bar

alternatively you could seek out a user-agent parsing library which turns the string into something more useful such as google-chrome windows or safari iphone in which case you could reasonably use a shorter varchar value

so if something works on safari it s more likely to work straightaway on google-chrome more than it is on firefox - but that s just a family resemblance at the end of the day you ll still have to test each as every webkit browser product and version still uses a different version of webkit

google-chrome is worse than safari

android google-chrome and iphone mobile safari are usually more similar to each other than desktop safari is to mobile safari the screen format will be similar the layout similar and you ll be able to try real touch events etc

for example try hiding a dom of of 200+ children in google-chrome vs safari vs firefox you will notice google-chrome takes 20+ sec safari takes 5+ seconds firefox takes less than 1 second

it seems that google-chrome internet explorer or safari are more strict than firefox on terms of security

one more thing google-chrome is css prefix free however safari may need -webkit prefix for some cutting edge features

i had created the website www.suezre.com and when viewed in google-chrome or firefox figcaption on the pictures looks good but on safari it takes much more space

apple s safari applies almost no cross domain restrictions to files opened locally but firefox is much more strict about what it permits with google-chrome somewhere in the middle

i ve been trying to sum up values over a swipe and see how different browsers report values and they vary a lot with safari reporting order of magnitude bigger numbers on almost all platforms google-chrome reporting quite more like 3 times more than firefox firefox being balanced on the long run but quite different among platforms on small movements on ubuntu gnome nearly only +3 or -3 seems like it sums up smaller events and then send a big +3

what i saw was that ios and safari both got worse per-record write times the more records i tried to write while google-chrome kept pretty much the same per-record write time regardless of the number of records i tried to write

i read somewhere that safari has more stringent requirements on cross domain scripting - it and google-chrome share the same code base

safari is more funny than google-chrome i can easily make google-chrome cache my page but safari does not

i also have .js files being redirected to javascript engines as well for main.js in google-chrome it tries main.v8.js in safari main.nitro.js in firefox main.gecko.js

the points of data in firefox and safari are much smoother in google-chrome they don t go past the dots

i m noticing huge performance issues in google-chrome firefox and safari when adding more nested lists programmatically too many reflows maybe

in safari it is several pixels higher up than in firefox and google-chrome and significantly lower in opera

i have had issues with dynamically created nodes that use filters and animatemotion has been a bugged in google-chrome for way too long... we use ff5+ as our interactive interfaces for this reason safari is getting better too

in google-chrome 43+ pouchdb stores blobs directly to indexeddb as-is so it s probably the best experience you re going to see performance-wise safari and old google-chrome are slower

on mac with safari webpage get more then 600mb ram which is not happening on google-chrome for example but work on canvas feel same laggy on both browsers

this does not seem to occur in safari or ie and a similar permission error occurs sometimes in firefox but is reproducible more often than not in google-chrome

in safari 10.0.3 cloneelement is 31 slower for the jsperf test mentioned above in google-chrome createelement is 17 slower for me

its weird when i use source sans pro it looks bolder on google-chrome but when i switch to safari it looks thinner

safari also seems to be more strict than what google-chrome did earlier

safari 5.1 still renders smoother than google-chrome but it is now clear that google has done much improvement

safari is more secure than ie or google-chrome

in any case vorbis clearly has the most coverage google-chrome has more of the market than safari now opera is about half of safari and obviously firefox is huge and it doesn t really have the strong opposition that theora has


smaller child fonts
safari makes child block s height larger than google-chrome

safari 5.1.10 6534.59.10 middle handles a smaller viewport but in sort order with a smaller viewport computes new image sizes even smaller than google-chrome

safari will display fonts without a specified size significantly smaller than in google-chrome


width larger 6px
images on google-chrome are much larger using the exact size of the image itself while safari respects width 140 height 140 settings

total width of button in safari web inspector 6px larger than in google-chrome web inspector


strtol	strtod---------------------------------------------------

others
note atof and similar functions don t detect overflows and return zero on error so there s no way to know if it failed not sure if it sets errno see also keith s comments about undefined behaviour for certain values so the point is you should use strtol for converting from strings to int and strtod for converting to double those have much better error handling


cpu	hyperthreading---------------------------------------------------

i7 processing non-hyper-threading
now - your i7 cpu have 4 cores + hyperthreading which results in more threads spawned for processing thus you can get more exceptions because for example 4 things can be processed at the same time when exception occurs

non-hyper-threading cores each correspond to 1 cpu whereas hyperthreading cores contain more than 1 typically 2 - logical - cpu


others
almost any new cpu has more than one core or if it has just one it might support hyperthreading and thus pretending it has more than one

hyperthreading and multi threading in general allows a cpu to execute more than one statement per cycle

i tried using schedule static num_threads 4 and noticed that my programme always completes in 11.5s to 11.7s always below 12s at about 320 cpu runs more consistently and uses less resources even if the best run is half a second slower than the rare outlier with hyperthreading

vcpu reg are virtual cpu registers that exist on many processors that have things like multiple cores hyperthreading or other features that enable higher layers to believe that there is more than one cpu present when there isn t -- such as today s x86s


thumb technology intel
the rule of thumb is that if a cpu is given more than double the count of actively running threads as it has execution units these are the physical cores on a cpu chip and logical processors like hyperthreading technology that splits one core into two then the os will spend more time scheduling threads and switching between them cache-thrashing than it will spend actually running the threads

a quad core intel cpu s with hyperthreading enabled has 4 physical cores yet 8 logical processors hyperthreading creates 4 more logical processors


facebooker2	koala---------------------------------------------------

others

graph facebook discussion
is fb_graph or koala gem better than facebooker2

relevant discussion here as well is fb_graph or koala ruby gem better than facebooker2 using the facebook graph


appfuse	spring---------------------------------------------------

if you actually need dao s this is something that comes out-of-the-box in appfuse and put partly in spring roo but there is also a great addon for spring roo hades addon that does a great job at this maybe even better than appfuse


agda	ats---------------------------------------------------

others
ats is a dependently-typed language that is designed for low-level programming though it s somewhat less elegant than agda


valgrind	tcmalloc---------------------------------------------------

others
try tcmalloc you are looking for a heap profiler although valgrind might be more useful initially


width	border-box---------------------------------------------------

others
my question is when we declare box-sizing border-box and the total width of content and padding and border are larger than the width that is declared for the element how does the browser solve this case


child value solution
if you need to have both fill the screen when the child is less than the width of the screen then both need min-width 100 and box-sizing border-box and you can remove the display-inline-block from the parent

there is one more solution besides setting box-sizing border-box and using a lower width value

but the button in your example is less than 15px wide so even with box-sizing border-box the button s width is pushed larger than your percentage


interpreted-language	compiled-language---------------------------------------------------

easier possible bytecode
an interpreted-language surely makes it easier but this is still entirely possible with compiled-language like c

while java could be described as a compiled and interpreted-language it s probably easier to think of java itself as a compiled-language and java bytecode as an interpreted-language


others
are compiled-language better than interpreted-language or vice-versa

this is usually seen in dynamic interpreted-language but is less common in compiled-language

especially in an interpreted-language like php where classes add more overhead than a compiled-language

interpreted-language are usually more high-level and therefore have features as dynamic typing including creating new variables dynamically without declaration the infamous eval and many many other features that make a programmer s life easier - but why can t compiled-language have these as well

my guess is that in interpreted-language the efficiency benefit in using switch statements is indeed smaller than in compiled-language


better performance examples
performance of programs in compiled-language is significantly better than that of an interpreted-language

writing in a compiled-language java or c++ in your examples would almost certainly give better performance than an interpreted-language like php


slower faster execution
it should be noted that interpreted-language are inherently many time slower than natively compiled-language

and perl like any interpreted-language is much slower than a compiled-language

php is an interpreted-language so will run a little slower than a compiled-language

while ruby and python are both interpreted-language and operation-for-operation slower than compiled-language the reality is in executing an application only a small portion of cpu time is spent in your code and the majority is spent into the built-in libraries you call into which are often native implementations and thus are as fast as compiled code

this makes interpreted-language generally slower than compiled-language due to the overhead of running the vm or interpreter

this is a good question but should be formulated a little different in my opinion for example why are interpreted-language slower than compiled-language

an interpreted-language will typically run one to two orders of magnitude slower than a compiled-language

interpreted-language execution speed are slower than compiled-language true but once there is need for more speed you can call in compiled stuff through gems or micro services

in my general programming experience compiled c c++ programs generally run faster than most other compiled-language like java or even compiled python and almost always run faster than interpreted-language like uncompiled python or javascript

there is no way an interpreted-language can be faster than a compiled-language or even a jit language under trivial conditions

a compiled-language will generally run faster than an interpreted-language so i think ruby and php start behind the eight ball but it really comes down to how you use the language and how you structure the code

so compiled-language are faster in execution as at the time of execution no compilation is required but in interpreted-language each execution step is preceded by a compilation step every time making it slow

that being said a compiled-language like c will almost always be faster than an interpreted-language like javascript

java seeks to find a compromise between a purely compiled-language with no portability and a purely interpreted-language that is significantly slower

fact is that interpreted-language like php are always slower than a compiled-language

from what i know a compiled-language such as c++ is much faster than an interpreted-language such as javascript

interpreted-language tend to be but not always are significantly slower than compiled-language

of course c++ or any compiled-language will be faster than an interpreted-language but you also have to take in account the development time of the web site app

mostly interpreted-language are a bit slower compared with compiled-language but i guess the difference is almost negligible in coffeescript javascript because of node.js

python is an interpreted-language so by definition is slower than other compiled-language but the drawback in the execution speed is not even noticeable in most of applications

naturally interpreted-language will run slower than compiled-language as compiled code can be ran blindly by the cpu where as compiled code needs to be checked ran line by line


performant operations level
then c which is one those languages closer to the processor level is very performant and generally speaking compiled-language because they turn your code into assembly language are more performant than interpreted-language

interpreted-language are inherently less performant than compiled-language - c will generally outperform python - some operations more than others


minimum	max---------------------------------------------------

number greater matches
the syntax is where min is zero or a positive integer number indicating the minimum number of matches and max is an integer equal to or greater than min indicating the maximum number of matches

this way the first value read will most likely be lower than the minimum at the moment and the first value will also be higher than the current max value

in general case you need to determine maximum and minimum shape coordinates along every axis and define minimum axis aligned integer bounding box with values rounded to larger using ceil for max and rounded to smaller using floor for min coordinates

the syntax is where min is a positive integer number indicating the minimum number of matches and max is an integer equal to or greater than min indicating the maximum number of matches

i want to validate a number as decimal up to two decimal and minimum range is greater than 0.00 and max range is up to 99.99

for group 1 the minimum value is actually 2 however i need minimum indexed lower than max value index position

my question is can we set max stack size lower than the minimum stack size which may be 4 kb for the goroutines

here i have an algorithm that adds a number to another number e.g current + step and if that number is greater than the max value the remainder of the step is added to the minimum

the minimum requirement and smaller than the max requirement

if you per se wanted the minimum index for a set of values with more than one minimum you d just swap out max for min at the front of the expression

the minimum week number is a single int value like 1 the max is never greater than two-digit int like 24 because there are 52 weeks in a year

now you are iterating exactly like your example with one change to know what is the next set you are moving to you have to replace every number in the current set with the next number in the array and replace the max option that less than the minimum you are saving

so i use the formula you have in your second query to first calculate the bounds -- the four lat long values at the extremes of the allowed radius then take those bounds and do a simple query to find the matches within them less than the max lat long more than the minimum lat long

this way if the next number n is greater than max + 1 then a gap would have been made and max + 1 is the minimum unobtainable number

the test taker passes if all their max scores are greater than all the test minimum scores or the total max scores is greater than the basictest qmscore

all numbers will always be equal to or greater than the minimum value or equal to or less than the max value

i would just iterate through the array keeping track of the total and check at each iteration if the value is smaller than the minimum or greater than the maximum and if so store those as the new min max

first i run a query to find the min and max for each security id then find the difference between the min and max and finally find a value that is 10 more than the minimum like this

in this example i would want to flag the following records in my data 2 lower than the minimum for x and 4 higher than the max for y

from here you also need to take into account if the user inputs a value higher than the max year of the data and also less than the minimum

how can the max value be larger than the minimum

i want to set limits to the picker such that the max date is today s date and the minimum date is not more than one year ago

the syntax is min max where min is zero or a positive integer number indicating the minimum number of matches and max is an integer equal to or greater than min indicating the maximum number of matches

4.if minimum value is greater than the current value in array than add difference of than in ans add the difference with current value update max from left

assuming width and height are both positive numbers the only way to get a negative output value from the scale is if you input a number that is less than the minimum domain value for the x scale or more than the maximum domain value on the y scale -- which implies that the max min functions aren t doing what you expect

the syntax is min max where min is a positive integer number indicating the minimum number of matches and max is an integer equal to or greater than min indicating the maximum number of matches


others
if it were possible to find such a cut then max-flow min-cut would not be true the max flow of the network would be greater than the minimum capacity of an s-t cut

i m simply checking the values of two input textboxes and alerting the user if the max price is less than the minimum price but they re evaluating backwards

the plugin dll itself also does not expose anything more than the minimum interface required by max for adding a few top level scripted classes

to make sure no path shorter than max can be found one has to monitor the minimum possible length of a path until the current point the minimum over a column in the distance table

still you must increase max also if your minimum is anything less than 15 the adk is now building an extra folder new stuff in truth the new version of the adt is annoying i am just starting and now you will see they have enforced the use of fragments

look-up in the case of failure should be constant time if the current element is less than the minimum element of the heap containing the max m elements we can reject it outright

take the max of the child s preferred height or a hard-coded minimum whichever is larger

why is the max time which happens on the first iteration of the loop 2-4x longer than the minimum time

i wrote this assuming that you might adjust the minimum to be more visible but you d keep the max at 1

if i is rather little just iterate and keep i minimum datas insert every new data in a binary tree of the i most little datas if it is less than the max of these datas


template symbol second
see if the max se value at the minimum cobble is less than the min se at the maximum cobble value

which means minimum of min repetitions but not more than max repetitions

- preceeding symbol template is expected to appear exactly minimum min times but not more than max times

if u want the second minimum then just change the max to min and change the less than sign to grater than


username object dates
for the above dto when i m trying to submit a json object with username length is less than the minimum length in the class length min 3 max 30 i got http 400 bad request

a bit of an rtfm answer open the file in csv format see the csv library and then iterate line by line converting the field that is a date into a date object see the docs for converting a string to a date object and if it is less than minimum so far store it as minimum similar for max with a special condition on the first line that the date becomes both min and max dates


theano	cntk---------------------------------------------------

others
it is similar in spirit to keras which is built as a high-level api on top of theano tensorflow cntk although the main difference is that lasagne implements only one backend allowing it to integrate more deeply with theano features


webchromeclient	webviewclient---------------------------------------------------

others
my observation is that you get the webpage title using webchromeclient in lesser time than using webviewclient

to sum up the webchromeclient is easier to use but the webviewclient allows you more configuration

note that you re using to different clients webviewclient and the webchromeclient you need to know the difference between them the main difference is that the webviewclient is more configurable


teamcity	psake---------------------------------------------------

others
i have been automating all my builds through psake and finding it really useful to get my teamcity build more powerful


affinity	processors---------------------------------------------------

others
on a system with more than one processors or processors cores you can normally assuming you do have a smp-enabled system cpu affinity doesn t prevent it expect those two processes to use both processors but you do not strictly have a guarantee

i have created a window application in c#.now i want to set the cpu affinity for this application.i may have 2 processors 4 processors 8 processors or may be more than 8 processors

so the difference between the two is that if you assign affinity at the thread level you can assign them to more than one processors and spread the load more than with all threads assigned to one processors


ffmpeg	handbrake---------------------------------------------------

others

encoder simpler libav
you may also use handbrake which is a simpler encoder than ffmpeg

occasionally ffmpeg or libav might be better suited but for most cases go with handbrake


profiler	visualvm---------------------------------------------------

others
you might be better off with a profiler like visualvm or chronon

i recommend using a profiler such as visualvm to get a more granular view on what s going on

one option is to use visualvm however a commercial profiler like yourkit may handle larger memory sizes better


pdcurses	ncurses---------------------------------------------------

others
i ve found pdcurses which is more like the ncurses but it lacks a lot of ncurses libraries


lasagne	cntk---------------------------------------------------

others
it is similar in spirit to keras which is built as a high-level api on top of theano tensorflow cntk although the main difference is that lasagne implements only one backend allowing it to integrate more deeply with theano features


flask	cherrypy---------------------------------------------------

others
flask is very good but cherrypy may be better suited for beginners


flex	robotlegs---------------------------------------------------

others
parsley is more robust and adds a lot more features than robotlegs which is why its been used in the world s largest flex applications


handbrake	libav---------------------------------------------------

others
occasionally ffmpeg or libav might be better suited but for most cases go with handbrake


kombu	celery---------------------------------------------------

others
i did some reading on kombu and it seems to be able to do what i m thinking of although at a much lower level than celery


srp	principles---------------------------------------------------

others
if you re interested look up some info on srp single responsibility principles to get more info on this concept

there is another principles which i like even more than srp - dry


monobjc	monomac---------------------------------------------------

others
when i evaluated monomac it was less mature than monobjc


contourf	imshow---------------------------------------------------

others
as an example of the second option i ll use imshow here because it makes more sense than contourf for random data but contourf would have identical usage other than the interpolation option.


activiti	drools---------------------------------------------------

others
i have implemented it using process library and my own java code however i m wondering can it be done in simpler way with activiti jbpm and drools


fullcalendar	jquery-week-calendar---------------------------------------------------

others
in some ways the jquery-week-calendar has more features at the moment but fullcalendar has a bigger following and is closing the gap on features


boost	cereal---------------------------------------------------

others
if you don t need to serialize raw pointers to things and instead either use c++11 style smart pointers or no pointers at all i d recommend using cereal as it supports pretty much everything in the standard library whereas boost has a more limited subset


floor	sqrt---------------------------------------------------

others
the other suggestion keep repeating until x stops changing does not work either because for non-perfect squares x will alternate between the floor and the ceiling of the root â because of integer mathematics the term n x will alternate when x is slightly smaller or slightly larger than sqrt n


ready	each---------------------------------------------------

others
that way each thread can pick up a link when it s ready which makes more sense than partitioning in advance

here s the question it seems that only one cfwritestreamwrite call is safe free of blocking per each kcfstreameventcanacceptbytes notification because from the second call we can t guarantee that the socket is ready to accept more data

what i need is the script to run on each individual row and be ready to handle more rows if they should come later on

and platform-specific solutions as kqueue bsd macosx epoll linux dev poll solaris are better if relatively small subset of all descriptors is ready on each cycle

the input calls it each time it s ready to accept more data

i update the edited value in the spinner from which user can select 1 option and with some other entries like price item user can save it in the database.this is my scenario what i want now is to retrieve the data from database separately under each value which is selected from spinner.how can i query the database.please help me..i think i have explained my problem clearly..i am ready to give more details

while these are not production ready they do include more fixes and html5 standard implementations with each release


ant	buildr---------------------------------------------------

others
that said if ant doesn t give you satisfaction in terms of flexibility then i don t see why buildr would be better


jar	manifest.mf---------------------------------------------------

others
i think that s why i can t use to launch my project this way works but jar way is better because everything including the main_class is described in manifest.mf

putting it in the jar file among the classes or adding its jar-relative path to the class-path entry of the jar s manifest.mf file is more than sufficient


tapestry	struts---------------------------------------------------

others
and beware that in this area there are many much more alternatives or fragmentation than in .net some more oriented to the mvc pattern struts struts2 stripes spring mvc some more component-based jsf tapestry wicket and some others gwt


bionic	glibc---------------------------------------------------

others
porting runtime libraries to work on top of bionic instead of glibc may be more interesting

note that there s much more than llvm and clang these compilers also rely on c++ standard libraries both have libc++ libc++abi mostly unchanged pnacl used to support libstdc++ c standard libraries both have musl pnacl also has newlib bionic some form of glibc compiler runtime compiler-rt linker and general user libraries such as sdl part of emscripten and for pnacl in webports


kdtree	octree---------------------------------------------------

others
kdtree needs less memory than octree and sometimes is even faster


nlb	iis---------------------------------------------------

others
i ve got arr in front of a client s ssrs setup right now no difficulties reported and it s 100 modern iis rather than legacy nlb which is less flexible when it comes to web-centric activities


addslashes	multibyte---------------------------------------------------

others
as mysql_real_escape_string escapes characters according to default charset so it is better than addslashes function and it properly sanitizes sql injections arising out of abuse of multibyte character sets but in another article here a workaround-scenario is shown that explains that injection can still be done


caffe	mxnet---------------------------------------------------

others
i like caffe but the amount of gpu memory caffe use is larger than mxnet i test in resnet-50 with mxnet-memonger


gtk	xlib---------------------------------------------------

others
you might use a low level x11 library like xcb -or the older xlib - it is used by graphical toolkits like qt or gtk or fox etc.. which are both free software toolkits so you could study their source code and xlib xcb are also free software


laravel	silex---------------------------------------------------

others
you can do a good job with php too but i suggest to use frameworks like silex slim or laravel that are better suited to put up a rest api which you will need if you want to use backbone


macvim	textmate---------------------------------------------------

others
is there any way to get macvim to scroll more smoothly textmate style

macvim sublimetext is much thicker whereas textmate is slicker and sophisticated


pdfbox	itextsharp---------------------------------------------------

others
edit 31 march 2014 for what it s worth i have found that pdfbox is much better at text extraction than itextsharp notwithstanding a bespoke strategy implementation and pdflib tet is slightly better than pdfbox but it s quite expensive


mouseover	mouseout---------------------------------------------------

others
every time you mouseover the image the caption keeps going higher and every time you mouseout it goes lower and lower

note without the mouseout it works better but tooltip stays until next mouseover

the id specific hotspots show an area #id-ed textarea at mouseover and then hide the textareas at mouseout note the css display hidden was remarkably faster than hide

ultimate function to also stop animation when mouseout maybe include more efficient coding using .wrap and perhaps pausing the image when mouseover image div


latex	stargazer---------------------------------------------------

others
stargazer is at least in my experience more general than latex from hmisc


valgrind	callgrind---------------------------------------------------

others
ps i think that writing script is easier than hacking valgrind plugin callgrind with adding several counters for every instruction type

nevertheless various profiling callgrind tool in valgrind cpu profiling google-perfutils and perf doesn t find those debugging symbols resulting in more or less useless output


glut	pysdl2---------------------------------------------------

others
i would suggest if you are not forced to use glut to use a more flexible alternative such as pygame pysdl2 or pyqt to create your context instead


quicksort	radix-sort---------------------------------------------------

others
why quicksort or introsort or any comparison-based sorting algorithm is more common than radix-sort

which of the two consumes more memory is not defined and depends on the input sequence to be sorted as well as on algorithm tuning parameters see the comments to one of the answers to why quicksort is more popular than radix-sort


opennlp	stanford-nlp---------------------------------------------------

others
i looking to use a suite of nlp tools for a personal project and i was wondering whether stanford s stanford-nlp is easier to use or opennlp

i find training in opennlp much easier than in stanford-nlp


level results ner
going forward for ner there as well stanford-nlp have the more accurate results compare to opennlp

but if you will look at the accuracy level stanford-nlp have more accurate detection than opennlp


touchesbegan	touchesmoved---------------------------------------------------

others
however the transition from the initial touchesbegan event to the first touchesmoved is less obvious sometimes the device waits a while

for some reason when the duration of touchesbegan is greater than the duration of touchesmoved my player will complete the touchesmoved actions first even though touchesbegan had to come first and then jump to a different x-position and then move with duration 4 to complete the touchesbegan


tolower	uppercase---------------------------------------------------

others
further uppercase comparison is more optimized than tolower if that tiny degree of performance matters

we uppercase this with toupper then we add on the next 3 characters of the string starting at the 4th character which we force in to lower case with tolower


colorbox	thickbox---------------------------------------------------

others
colorbox is implemented as a jquery plugin which is a bit different and better than thickbox s sort-of-self-contained widget model


guava	lambdaj---------------------------------------------------

others
the guava library is much more popular than lambdaj and does allow you to avoid for while loops by using preficates and filter methods


theano	pylearn---------------------------------------------------

others
and using keras or lasagne is way simpler to develop nns then pure theano which was just side research project in montreal to support development of pylearn


avro	thrift---------------------------------------------------

others
but avro offers far more than just doing away with the need for your own writables although that is in my view a considerable plus it offers fairly efficient serialization the choice between serializing against generated entity classes like thrift requires or using a so-called genericrecord structure instead and not having to have tagged data

if you are developing your hbase application in java i recommend using the raw hbase api - that is more powerful than thrift rest avro etc

also it is worth mentioning that besides thrift protobuf and avro there are some more solutions on the market such as capt n proto or bolt


scribe	twitter4j---------------------------------------------------

others
i have an app that uses the public part of the twitter api the on who not requires to login but with the update the login is required so i need to implement oauth i ve seen there are libraries like twitter4j who makes this easier but my app has a lot of code and i don t wanna rewrite it not now so i ve think to use scribe or oauth-signpost but i dont realy know how to


rsa	dsa---------------------------------------------------

others
use dsa it tends to be more compact than rsa

i ve already done the rsa but dsa is bigger deal to me

i guess rsa is older and dsa is newer

rsa is also a better choice than dsa because it has much better breadth of support for signatures still considered secure by nist

however in this case dsa key size is less than rsa key size

that continued usage of 1024-bit prime field elgamal or dsa keys is much riskier than it is for 1024-bit rsa all are still commonly used because once a successful attack has been conducted against a single well-chosen prime field all users of that prime field may be affected at little additional effort.

however dsa verification expect verification calls to be 100x issue is about 10x slower than rsa verification


greater ones shorter
dsa and ecdsa both produce shorter signatures with much greater strength that rsa

dsa signatures are signficantly shorter than rsa ones


faster generation expensive
a dsa signature generation could be somewhat faster than a rsa signature generation maybe up to twice faster

the third operation is made much faster is the client uses a rsa key pair rsa signature verification is very fast whereas dsa signature verification is expensive actually somewhat more expensive than dsa signature generation


equivalent security 1024-bit
for the signature part you may want to use dsa or ecdsa they yield much shorter signatures typically 320 bits for a dsa signature of security equivalent to a 1024-bit rsa signature

dsa has signature that is independent of key strength and is much smaller than rsa signature for equivalent security rsa 1024 1568 vs dsa 192


slower testing
this is why rsa is much slower than dsa

i have made some testing and it came out that rsa is lot slower than dsa


connect	geddy---------------------------------------------------

others
geddy is not better than connect express the big thing that differs is the structure of it

so what makes geddy significantly better than connect


add-on	xpcom---------------------------------------------------

others
mozilla has stated that they plan to deprecate add-on that depend on xul xpcom and xbl. while not all bootstrapped add-on depend on these technologies there is a tendency for for bootstrapped add-on to operate at a lower level than add-on sdk and webextension add-on

you could try using c-types with ff which is a regular dll being called by javascript in your add-on this is way better approach that using xpcom because if the interfaces you use in there can change in each ff version indeed you will have to do multiple dlls each for your add-on supported ff versions


loops	while-loop---------------------------------------------------

others
try to simplify your code and use do-while-loop instead while-loop should produce a better code do while will at least do one loops and then inspect the next condition before do the next loops but while will inspect the condition first if it is okay it will do loops

if you re just going to loops through point use a for-loop as while-loop is more prone to dropping into an endless loops if you forgot to increment counter or doing wrongly or do it in multiple places

it is quite likely that having an if inside a while-loop will run slower but modern compilers are quite clever and i have certainly seen cases where the compiler hoists such a choice out of loops in cases where the conditions don t change

also i made this two days ago mostly as a draft to get started with and there are likely other things that can be better so excuses if anything seems somewhat sloppy in my opinion the whole while-loop could be done better but at that moment i chose it because a different approach to loops through didn t work can t really remember what exactly it was anymore

i searched a lot and discovered nice approaches of others that do solve my problem but out of curiosity i would love to know if there is solution to my problem that keeps the while-loop despite a for-loop would be more appropriate in the first place as i know the range but the day will come when i will need a while loops

is there any time that a do-while loops would be a better style of coding than a normal while-loop


dplyr	lubridate---------------------------------------------------

others
the lubridate library and dplyr will make this easier


error-handling	exception-handling---------------------------------------------------

others
exception-handling are more natural error-handling mechanism for c++ language


awk	ksh---------------------------------------------------

others
4.c i am working on aix so i only have sh and ksh no bash therefore i cannot use the array tools provided by the latter that s why i thought of awk that and the fact that i think awk is probably stronger though i might be probably


stdout	fflush---------------------------------------------------

others
i guess that these lines have shorter output so the fflush frequency is lower i used the stdout line to print a deliberate help message

occasionally the stdout needs more than a write method fflush is another common one which stringio will handle


sqlcommandbuilder	sqldataadapter---------------------------------------------------

others
since i have several gridcontrols that work like this with different data i am trying to not generate select insert update and delete commands for sqldataadapter myself instead of that i m using sqlcommandbuilder to keep it simpler


freebsd	opensolaris---------------------------------------------------

others
it s easy much easier than installing freebsd or god forbid opensolaris pretty straightforward and the perl and python will be 64 bits out of the box and part of default installation


jmeter	soapui---------------------------------------------------

others
actually it is much better than soapui because with jmeter you can easily read the data from csv and parameterize it

speaking from personal experience i have found jmeter to be more reliable for performance testing ws than soapui

i have found jmeter to be more reliable than soapui or loadui


justmock	typemock---------------------------------------------------

others
justmock less expensive than typemock but still expensive

other profiler based mocking frameworks like typemock isolator or justmock are probably easier to work with but they are commercial solutions


shadowing	named---------------------------------------------------

others
i believe the reasoning behind it is that it allows the parameters to be named nicer by preventing shadowing of member variables

when you re not worrying about shadowing this is more flexible if the named of the object changes

not using the same named is a more common practice to avoid confusion and shadowing

note that naming a local variable strlen thus shadowing the standard function of that named is going to more than a little confusing for someone who looks at your code later


sctp	udp---------------------------------------------------

others
sctp mapped over udp ipv4 allows more private hosts per public address but udp mappings in ipv4 nat gateways are notoriously tricky to establish and keep maintained due to the fact that udp is a connectionless transport without any explicit state for a nat to track


mapply	lapply---------------------------------------------------

others
the map or mapply functions are more natural to use than lapply when you have multiple lists of corresponding objects


membase	couchdb---------------------------------------------------

others
i d like to add that couchbase is a faster and more scalable option than couchdb the 2.0 version introduces views at a high level it s a distributed memcached membase server merged with couchdb but of course more sophisticated than just mashing them together

the benefits of map-reduce and indexing as well as eventually consistent replication that couchdb brings are nothing less than huge for membase...and the benefits of low-latency clustering and ui that membase brings to couchdb are arguably just as important


h.264	hevc---------------------------------------------------

others
edit h.265 hevc is even better at compression 50 of h.264 size in some cases but support is not yet widespread so stick with h.264 for now

at the qualities i m recording 720p or 1080p the file size of an hevc-encoded video should be 40-60 of an identical h.264-encoded video and i am seeing this when i use the default camera app on ios but when i use avassetwriter as above or in the project linked above i m seeing file sizes be about three times larger with hevc than with h.264


mouseout	mousedown---------------------------------------------------

others

best middle notification
this may make for various race conditions and may necessitate using events which give you earlier notification than mouseup mousedown mouseenter mouseleave mouseover mouseout

mousedown mouseup is indeed the only way you can get notified of middle button interaction so detecting a down-then-up event without intervening mouseout event is more or less the best you can do


neo4j	arangodb---------------------------------------------------

others
it feels like arangodb is focused on graph operations and neo4j fits more the needs of using graphs if you have more relations than rows the reason to use graphs instead of relations with joins


qpainter	qimage---------------------------------------------------

others
try painting via a qimage -- the qpainter textantialiasing is more likely to be honoured that way


opengl-es	glsurfaceview---------------------------------------------------

others
textureview will display opengl-es rendering but is much more flexible than glsurfaceview and will follow the normal layout hierarchy in android which allows views to be moved on the display


svm	cross-validation---------------------------------------------------

others
however for the other question making svm run faster in python this solution is not likely to enhance performance either as it involves additional cross-validation and does not support parallelization


websphere	ibm---------------------------------------------------

others
migration between different versions of websphere might be somewhat more tricky but i m sure ibm published at least one redbook on that topic

it only adds some more java ee capabilities ejb and so on and of course the ibm sausage over it so i wouldn t expect websphere to be much faster than tomcat

ibm makes it easier for those who can t afford websphere application developer or rational application developer which are both eclipse flavour to use eclipse

this ibm technote has more details on the signals part what is a signal and why does this matter for websphere application server

websphere development studio v7 wdsc is older than ibm i 6.1 your build date is 2007 the article you re referencing came out in 2008

oracle s other application server weblogic still doesn t even fully support java ee 7 - both they and ibm seem to have similar strategies of maintaining stability in their full-fat releases while being more bleeding edge with glassfish for oracle and the liberty profile for ibm s websphere


changeset	cherry-pick---------------------------------------------------

others
this will work for hotfixes and it is simpler than cherry-pick your development changeset from your default branch

while others have rightfully pointed you to git cherry-pick you should understand that the changeset might have broader meaning that you might originally maintain


strstr	substr---------------------------------------------------

others
if you only want to search for plain substr you are much better off using the standard c string.h function strstr


profiler	callgrind---------------------------------------------------

others
compared to callgrind kcachegrind the profiler runs much faster having max 5 slowdown typically and it s much deeper as to why the code runs slow as it understands vectorization and running in real time means i o profiling is accurate


jung	jgraph---------------------------------------------------

others
i ve created an application with this library instead of jgraph because i thought that jung is easier to learn than jgraph for newbies even if it provide less features

can i use jgraph or is jung better


toolchain	bionic---------------------------------------------------

others
unless you particularly need to build against a more standard libc than bionic you can just use the ndk s toolchain either by copying the hello-jni example and changing build_shared_library to build_executable in the jni android.mk or using the script to generate a stand alone toolchain


h.264	webm---------------------------------------------------

others
- you can also consider using webm which is a free alternative to h.264 and has better support on some platforms than fragmented mp4


uiview	subviews---------------------------------------------------

others
i have an issue i m creating a uiview that is returned from a method and that part is fine but what i ve noticed is that when i add sublayers to one of the subviews those layers overlap subviews that are higher up in the hierarchy textview and imageview the sublayers added to testviewcopy are appearing over top of these subviews and they aren t supposed to

the issue is that once the alpha of the uiview is less than 1.0 i can see all the subviews sides and the one that gets me the most is the outline of an uiimageview can be seen that would otherwise not as it is the same colour as the uiview

your scrollview height is less than the uiview which is the subviews in your case of scrollview and for scrolling it fully you will have to set your scrollview contentsize height more than the height of the view you are scrolling in it please give a check on this point

though earlier uiview and uiscrollview have the same area after keyboard shown the blue uiview becomes smaller but its subviews button text fields is outside its area

the subviews version is definitely faster since having the controls loose on the uiview took more like 2 seconds to update

if you take a look at the associated guides you ll see core animation and layers does require hit testing though that s relatively easy but it s far cleaner than the uiview doing all the drawing and more efficient than many subviews

you are seeing a noticeable jump in interface response because subviews do in fact consume quite a bit of memory uiview are very expensive compared to their underlying calayers and as such calling -removesubview not only unloads stress from the gpu but also frees up more memory as the subviews is usually released afterwards

change the contentsize of your scrollview.your uiview size and uiscrollview size is same if the uiscrollview contentsize is more than its subviews size then scroll will happen change the line overviewscroll setcontentsize cgsizemake screenframe.size.width screenframe.size.height-25

i m sure you could do something with auto-layout but when you have a view that has subviews that need to be positioned within it subclassing uiview is a better way to go in my opinion


uiviewcontroller taller performance
i have a label with a single character that i wish to be bigger than the uiview that it s a subviews of

i want to add a uiview of smaller frame as subviews to parental view but i am not getting the needed

i have a smaller uiview as a subviews to the main uiview on my uiviewcontroller

when using embed in - uiview the new view will be a bit bigger than the subviews

they re much bigger than the uiview of which they are subviews

i have a uiview class hierarchy that has self.layer.shouldrasterize turned on in order to improve scrolling performance all of them have static subviews that are larger than the screen of the device

add smaller webview as a subviews to the uiview

i have 2 more uiview as subviews in scrollcontainer view

you could put a smaller uiview as subviews of your selectionview and change tha background color of that view

because the uiview is smaller it is going to crop out the larger subviews

do i just create a new uiview that is 4px larger than the selected object and and make the selected view a subviews of it

the uiview is taller than the screen so in ib i pulled it out of the scroll view so i could see it all but i never moved it back to being a subviews of the scroll view


apple content uicollectionview
for my circular viewgroup i just want to put each basic view uibutton uiimageview ... around center of my circular viewgroup i read the apple doc about uiview and uicollectionview and both can contains zero or more subviews and i don t know what i should use uiview seems less difficult than uicollectionview but uicollectionview seems more appropriate for what i want to do maybe i am wrong but how implement customcollectionlayout and how set this layout in customuicollectionview because i planed to add in future custom drawing and animation

of course uiscrollview can have more than one content view just as any uiview can have more than one subviews and this case it will be more difficult to render its layer


cairngorm	mate---------------------------------------------------

others
i m more familiar with mate than cairngorm but what i do in this situation is to back up my pop up with a model and dispatch the events off of the model


groovy	gpath---------------------------------------------------

others
you can read up on groovy collections and gpath to learn more


monkeyrunner	androidviewclient---------------------------------------------------

others
i recomend to use dtmilano tool androidviewclient that is easier to use than monkeyrunner

i need to perform several device.touch events as fast as possible however androidviewclient seems to achieve those significantly slower than monkeyrunner


googletest	gmock---------------------------------------------------

others
if you re using googletest you may be able to use gmock to make this easier

i m almost sure you can t somehow automate it and this operation would require rethinking and recompositioning of your tests to follow the googletest semantics if you use something specialized to create your mocks then porting them to gmock would require even more effort simply because gmock s approach is not the obvious one and is actually complicated


vmware	bootcamp---------------------------------------------------

others
i ve found that bootcamp was slightly faster than vmware non bootcamp image but i still use vmware the majority of the time because i like using the host os for things like mail chat browsing


rspec	minitest---------------------------------------------------

others
in minitest i could add this check for each class with 1 line include diameterizableinterfacetest. in rspec it takes 4 more lines

since im using fixtures would this maybe be a db cleaner issue im not using it right now as im only using pre-created fixtures currently i ve never used db cleaner with minitest as im only familiar with using it with rspec and factory girl

multiplying	multiplication---------------------------------------------------

values possibility int
math.random returns double values between 0.0 and 1.0 so even when you are multiplying it with kids.size if size is 1000 there is a great possibility that the multiplication result is still less than 1 and so converting to int would return 0

another possibility would be to multiplying the values and check if the result is equal to 0 but this approach is probably a lot slower since multiplication takes usually more processor cycles than comparing values and or ing them


others
the reason for this intuitively is that the last multiplication does dramatically more work than any of the previous multiplication so much so in fact that summing up the work of all the preceding multiplies gives something asymptotically dominated by the last multiplying

multiplication is slightly more complex as it needs an integer multiplying followed by a scale back such as 0.72 2 becomes 72 200 becomes 14400 becomes 144 scaleback becomes 1.44

if you start with zero and multiplying it by whatever number s it stays zero -- it s not a neutral starting point for a series of multiplication it s more of a fixed point a black hole in a sense

in the remote case those operations are not simplified assuming that there is a jit that maps the multiplication and add opcodes in a 1 1 relationship to their cpu instruction counterparts in most modern architectures all integer arithmetic operations usually take the same number of cycles so it will be faster multiplying once than add four times just checked it addition is still slightly faster than multiplication 1 clock vs 3 clocks so it still pays using a multiplication here

there just isn t a lot you can do about this other than not using operator at all to do your multiplication and find a more suitable api to multiplying your matrices

this is not true for matrix chain the cost of multiplying 100 100 100 100 is much greater than 100 100 100 100 100 1 because two matrix-vector multiplication is much cheaper than a matrix-matrix

multiplication and division are much more complicated and the compiler usually produces some small helper functions to deal with these whenever you multiplying 64-bit numbers together

while it is true that a simple shift or add is often faster than a multiplication but not always â multiplication are faster than you might think the only way you could use it here inside the loop is if you first checked to see that you were supposed to be multiplying by 2 and the cost of doing that check more specifically the cost of making the decision as a result of that check is far more costly than a simple integer multiplication

note that for large values you ll need to be careful that the multiplication doesn t overflow - perhaps by converting to a wider type or to floating point or by carefully multiplying and dividing by smaller factors

in a 64 bit application this code will be a lot faster than in a 32 bit application in a 32 bit application multiplying two 64 bit numbers take 3 multiplication and 3 additions on 32 bit values - however it might be still faster than a division on a 32 bit machine

matrix multiplication is the easier one there are several matrix implementations with a multiplying method in packages org.apache.spark.mllib.linalg and org.apache.spark.mllib.linalg.distributed

if 50 is replaced by x a value known only at runtime there will be a multiplication before the add the multiplication canbe optimised into a faster operation if the multiplicand is simple enough as one instruction because there is support to multiplying by 1 2 4 8 and 16 - at least in some processors and even risc processors multiplication is often more complex than a few add and shift operations - small numbers are often very easy to deal with this way but 575 or 13412 may not be so easy to convert to a small number of simple operations so a proper multiplication will be needed

still while it might be better than multiplying by say 17 16+1 or 12 8+4 as they only add in a couple bit-shifted copies of the original value instead of five it s a very weak hash compared to hash functions that do more than a single running multiplication and i ll illustrate that using some statistical analysis.

since bit-shifting operation is typically less costly than multiplication to speed things up you will see in some program people use left bit-shift operation as a replacement of multiplication when they mean to multiplying it by an integer number of power of 2 that is 2 4 8 16 etc

the autojit compiler realizes you re multiplying by all 0s and removes the matrix multiplication completely and simply returns a matrix of all 0s in the 1s it skips the actual multiplication part and just does the summation part of a matrix multiplication which is slightly slower than just returning all 0s finally the final one actually forces the compiler to have to do a matrix multiplication since it can t assume the answer

since you want to do same thing couple times writing your multiplication num1 num2 function yourself with only addition and using that when multiplying would be much better choice


divide numbers zeros
after analysing your code there is a final unsigned 32 bit integer overflow in the last multiplication by 10 you multiplying by 10 not by 2 so you can get up to four new bits in each multiplication making it easier for an overflow even if you do unsigned arithmetic which is recommended so you don t need to play with the signs

multiplication is slightly harder just multiplying two scaled numbers and then divide by your scale factor

so the bottom line is after every divide do the multiplying the 5 with 5 and if the result of multiplication is less than the equals to n then divide the n with result and add the zeros counter variable

multiplying first is probably simpler than using floating point if you only want an integer result and if you know that the multiplication will never overflow

you have to multiplying both the width and the height by a constant and the scaled result of the multiplication should be less than 16777215

perhaps it s also relevant that the first three lines of the posted code multiplying matrix elements repeatedly since repeated multiplication can generate numbers less than 1 as well

and don t use divide where multiplying will do multiplication is typically faster though not always

multiplication is the easier of the tasks just remember to multiplying each block of one number with the other and carry the zeros


division faster operation
in usual programming practice one wouldn t bother and simply multiplying by the floating-point representation of 180 ï because multiplication is so much faster than division

implementing multiplication is easier if you remember an shl operation performs the same operation as multiplying the specified operand by two

i believe that division would be faster than multiplying by the inverse since the inverse has to be calculated first then multiplication performed

feel free to use non-mathematical symbols for this but since you re basically multiplying probabilities the multiplication symbol seemed more likely to give an intuitive idea for what is going on than incorporateprobability or somesuch.

mathematically left shifting is the same as multiplying a number by a power of 2 but as the operation is done only by shifting it is much faster than doing multiplication

if you re dividing or multiplying by a variable then it s likely that multiplication is slightly faster because the logic is generally more simple

if i make a mistake and multiplying a number by 1.0 instead of 1 and i do not use any compiler optimization then my multiplication will last much longer than multiplying a number by 1

note that i ve incorporated dshin s comment that multiplying is faster than division however the performance improvement is about 90 removing the binary search 10 multiplication vs

the code is written like this in the belief that a shifts and adds are significantly faster than multiplication and b the compiler doesn t know the best way to multiplying by ten


higher precedence numeric
since multiplication has a higher precedence than subtraction you should subtract 0 to your digit character before multiplying it

either way your example with the numeric expression would multiplying by 3 first because multiplication has higher precedence than addition or subtraction


autocompletetextview	spinner---------------------------------------------------

others
also from your requirements autocompletetextview is more suitable than spinner

if you don t want to write anything on autocompletetextview and select items you have to implement the spinner is more great


width	column-count---------------------------------------------------

others
and you also set width of .topcolortile div.topcolorcard by 375px it s wrong here you can not set with of child node larger than width of parent column-count


xrange	enumerate---------------------------------------------------

others
enumerate is more pythonic but xrange is fine here too

enumerate is also more appropriate than xrange

why is enumerate slower than xrange + lst i

if you measure properly you ll see there s essentially no difference enumerate is microscopically faster than xrange in this example but well within noise


switching	accessory---------------------------------------------------

others
but when more than on switching in accessory is on - if three switches are on and i turn off one switching then the did select row works


jscrollpane	jlayeredpane---------------------------------------------------

others
the problem is that with the code below the jlayeredpane always expands to fit the size of the jscrollpane and in the event that the jscrollpane is smaller than the jlayeredpane it does not provide the scrolling ability


avplayer	avassetreader---------------------------------------------------

others
measure how much faster than realtime avassetreader can decode at replace avplayer with your own metal + avassetreader path if you think that some performance has gotten lost in transit


translation	transliteration---------------------------------------------------

others
for removal and transliteration there is a better tool called tr translation or delete characters

the issue here is that an automatic translation from sql to linq will often have to perform more transliteration than translation - generating examples of how not to write linq queries


plupload	swfupload---------------------------------------------------

others
looking for a swfupload url their site is down so maybe plupload is a better bet


mp4	webm---------------------------------------------------

others
the ogv version of the video seems to run a little better than the webm which itself seems to run better than the mp4

probably webm will load faster than standard mp4 but i am not so familiar with webm format

webm is usually more robust than mp4 which can be all over the place

- you can also consider using webm which is a free alternative to h.264 and has better support on some platforms than fragmented mp4

also it looks like when i transcode webm to mp4 2.7 is 30 faster than webm

the mp4 implementation is more widely used and wouldn t require a webm fallback in most browsers


qfile	qtextstream---------------------------------------------------

others
a qfile may be used by itself or more conveniently with a qtextstream or qdatastream


facade	command-pattern---------------------------------------------------

others
i guess the point that the article is trying to make here is that a facade is easier to implement when you already have this command-pattern in place


formview	detailsview---------------------------------------------------

others
the same as for detailsview but keep in mind that with formview you are more free of how to present your data out of the box detailsview need some tweaks to behave the same


qwebview	qtextbrowser---------------------------------------------------

others
unless you need javascript flash css or something like that you can replace qwebview with qtextbrowser which is both faster and free of static leaks


next	except---------------------------------------------------

last iterator second
moving iterator from one element to the next is an o c operation both in the list and in the multi map except c is slightly smaller for the list so it is unlikely you ll gain much by combining the two

it compares every item except the last - it will be checked by the second last item and checks whether the next item is smaller


others
once i did that all went well except for being slower than molasses which begins my next adventure

for such numbers as 54321 the else statement will be executed never because any next digit is greater than max1 except the first two digits

not totally sure what you want to do but using a while checking if the user input is equal to next and if not trying to cast to int using a try except is a better idea

the next solution is faster than using in and except clauses

for music like what i am using it for the synchronisation didn t really matter except that it s nice having the next song come on sooner than later when changing tracks

for me they serve pretty same purpose to hide complexity except accordion is imho better for continuous-reading it s easier to quickly go to next section while tabs seems to be more random-access

it looks almost ok except i can t make the a1 cell to align right next to a2 on wider screens

from the mozilla perspective the purpose of these changes except for adding more capabilities for use by web developers is to lead up to javascript 2.0 that is being developed as the next revision of ecma 262 revision 4 tc39 workgroup

the next example does more or less the same except from an oop perspective

in both cases you may also have to shift one or two elements off the start end of some blocks to the end start of the previous next block again at most o n 1 2 times to maintain an invariant that no two blocks differ in size by more than 1 except for the last which is used to take up slack


greater integer lower
it works except for in the case of the next number being greater than the current one

now i would like to take the ceiling of this number except in cases where the amount it is greater than the next lower integer is smaller than some epsilon


variance	kurtosis---------------------------------------------------

image measure infrequent
higher kurtosis means more of the variance in the image is the result of infrequent extreme deviations as opposed to frequent modestly sized deviations

for this measure higher kurtosis means more of the variance is the result of infrequent extreme deviations as opposed to frequent modestly sized deviations


others

mergesort	shellsort---------------------------------------------------

others
will using shellsort instead of insertionsort inside mergesort yields a faster performance


avassetexportsession	avassetreader---------------------------------------------------

others
in my experience avassetexportsession is slightly more performant than using avassetreader and avassetwriter for a straight forward format a - format b type conversion however that said it s probably not by enough to be too concerned about


erd	diagram---------------------------------------------------

others
the circle in erd denotes the lower multiplicity bound of 0 see diagram bellow


elasticsearch	kibana---------------------------------------------------

better webui context
this is too high level to implement this on kibana lets make it more in elasticsearch context

as kibana is the webui for elasticsearch it is better make it high availability


others
if you would like a unified front-end for elasticsearch and opentsdb you could consider grafana which has support for both elasticsearch and opentsdb but less functionality than kibana in regard to elasticsearch

the new name is meant to clarify that the company is more than just elasticsearch such as the open source logstash and kibana

while i have found plenty of documentation and tutorials about how to actually install and configure elasticsearch logstash and kibana i have found less information about how i should set up the software across my servers to maximize performance

odd that elasticsearch is more tolerant than kibana


jfreechart	achartengine---------------------------------------------------

others
android plot and other free chart solutions mentioned here doesn t support annotations the only one is afreechart which is a port of jfreechart for android i am currently using it and it is awesome and has much more features than achartengine


xstream	jackson---------------------------------------------------

others
jackson xml module faster than xstream


ionic	angular---------------------------------------------------

others
i ve only done one experiment with angular material myself and i wasn t experiencing any real performance issues at the time but i did read some people writing about it being slower than plain ionic

i think your code has no problem except that angular has deprecated legacy promise methods success and error of http after version 1.4.4 you should use standard then method instead if your ionic depends on higher angular version

the docs for ionic 2 are clear user-friendly and much less intimidating than angular 2 docs


treeview	tabcontrol---------------------------------------------------

others
i can t find any way to make the treeview s height smaller or the tabcontrol s larger


wadl	wsdl---------------------------------------------------

others
my conclusion now a days wadl is more common that rest and integration frameworks like camel cxf already supports wadl generate and consume because it is similar to wsdl therefore most easy to understand in this migration process soap to rest

and when somebody needs wadl may be then better to use ws soap service + wsdl

like the rest of rest wadl is lightweight easier to understand and easier to write than wsdl


nullreferenceexception	objectdisposedexception---------------------------------------------------

others
an objectdisposedexception will be more informative than a random nullreferenceexception but unless you re cleaning up unmanaged resources it s not usually necessary to set a bunch of fields to null


single-quotes	double-quotes---------------------------------------------------

others
that said this is html so double-quotes are actually more common for attributes than single-quotes

escaping the quotes with back-slashes works hi there you but embedding apostrophes single-quotes within double-quotes is often easier

first you can use double-quotes or q it just takes more work than single-quotes or q

another side note single-quotes inside xpath string looks a bit tidier than escaped double-quotes imo

i tend to use double-quotes just out of habit from other languages but i don t have a strong preference i m willing to change if i hear of a compelling reason why single-quotes are better but to date i ve not even heard a good reason let alone a compelling reason


androidviewclient	hierarchyviewer---------------------------------------------------

others
androidviewclient while not faster because it relies on the same protocol as hierarchyviewer may provide a simpler alternative to write tests


cocos2d-x	libgdx---------------------------------------------------

others
performance i did some test with simple game similar to swing copters and found that game created with libgdx consumes 15-20 more ram on ios device that the same game created with cocos2d-x but then i used apportable to run cocos2d-x game on my android device and found it almost not playable


dpkt	scapy---------------------------------------------------

others
or is it just that scapy is slower than dpkt

scapy is a better performer than dpkt


shapefile	geojson---------------------------------------------------

others
it s much easier with a shapefile than a geojson as shapefile are much more common in gis software


touchesbegan	touchesended---------------------------------------------------

others
btw for extra credit if you are using ios 3.2 or 4.0 or later use the uipangesturerecognizer class to handle the drag and drop logic - the drag and drop motion is a lot smoother than overriding touchesbegan touchesmoved touchesended .


greater touch current
if the value of touchesbegan is greater than touchesended then an active touch is going on

if the value of touchesended is more than 3 seconds beyond the current time and the time of touchesbegan is still before touchesended then it s time to show your hint


popover	tooltip---------------------------------------------------

others
a tooltip has more in common with a popover but they are generally regarded as a popup historically

you can also use bootstraps modal to display your message but personally i think bootstrap popover would be much better than a modal or you can simply display a tooltip asking user to sign up or sign in

not having the tooltip arrow of a popover would be better


apache-poi	docx4j---------------------------------------------------

others
but for the task you describe you d probably be better off with docx4j with which i m involved or apache-poi - especially if you are trying to do this server-side or in an environment where the client pc environment is unknown

i used apache-poi for excel sheet and i know that it has a good api support for word doc too but i heard that docx4j is better in handling word documents

a better answer than apache-poi is to use docx4j

if you are dealing with docx document docx4j is more convenient than apache-poi


stdio	fflush---------------------------------------------------

others
not flushing after each line endl fflush will be better for performance in pipelines if you want performance you ll also likely want to turn of syncing with stdio by doing ios sync_with_stdio false


qtablewidget	qgraphicsscene---------------------------------------------------

others
i have a qgraphicsview nested within a few widgets qframe and then in a qtab and i want to be able to drag-and-drop a qtablewidget which is within the qgraphicsscene onto a totally different widget - another qtablewidget which is much higher up in the window but not a parent


rethinkdb	couchdb---------------------------------------------------

others
rethinkdb is more similar to pouchdb couchdb


glibc	newlib---------------------------------------------------

others
note that there s much more than llvm and clang these compilers also rely on c++ standard libraries both have libc++ libc++abi mostly unchanged pnacl used to support libstdc++ c standard libraries both have musl pnacl also has newlib bionic some form of glibc compiler runtime compiler-rt linker and general user libraries such as sdl part of emscripten and for pnacl in webports


typemock	moles---------------------------------------------------

others
moles is more often compared contrasted to typemock in that it offers a set of facilities outside of moq and or rhinomocks sweet spot

sorry can t give you specifics on the problems i faced - typemock was definitely more powerful to use as it is a lot older and mature - pex moles is fun though i found the tutorial for sharepoint rather nice unit testing sharepoint foundation with microsoft pex and mole

i have no concrete figures on that but from my own experience i d estimate that instrumented tests are around 100-400 slower typemock seeming to be faster than ms moles


bmp	ppm---------------------------------------------------

others
i used ppm pgm files as they are simpler to write and more portable than bmp

the only thing i can suggest is that you use ppm format which is even easier than bmp for you to read from


dictionary	map---------------------------------------------------

others
c++ std map behaves more like a python defaultdict than dictionary

there also comes a point where assuming that the map is pre-built mapping types to methods with a dictionary will be faster than traversing a linear list of types which is essentially what using a bunch of if blocks gets you

though if you are going to eventually fill a substantial portion of the map the dictionary method is much less efficient

map is slightly better because the shared dictionary has around 480 entries instead of around 450 but it s still inconsistent and not all 500 as expected

generator expressions are generally preferred to map and using the dictionary constructor is more canonical than dict.fromkeys

the immutable dictionary implementation is faster but no less pure in usage than the map implementation

but lastly unless i m missing something this would be easier with a map or an object used as a dictionary of ids

for example if you want to index your data using a string like a dictionary lookup then the map will perform better

for suitably large examples of each dictionary overcomes the constant factor by which it s slower than std map and will actually do operations like lookup insertion etc

for lists containing 1000 elements the dictionary zip version is the fastest the generator and the list comprehension versions are virtually identical and they are 1.5 times slower and the functional map reversed is considerably slower

using this hint we can try to guess that a fixmap must correspond to a dictionary data type in c# since a map is more or less like a dictionary of key-value pairs

i know this question is a bit older but in es2015 there is a new data structure called map that is much more similar to a dictionary that you would use in c#

is there a way to handle this simply with a thread pool and map or do i have to do everything in terms of raw function calls and tuples lists dictionary or get more elaborate with multiprocessing or some other parallelism library


better fields word
since you want to map some fields to others using a dictionary is a better choice than using a list

if what you are making is a map from one word to another you might be better off with a dictionary


value reverse common
data structure to implement reverse functionality of a dictionary that is more than one key map to a common value using python

a dictionary might have more than one key map to one value or one key map to several values like chaining in a hasthtable eg twitter hashtag searches


std worse user
std map though is actually implemented in a way that many operations are slower than dictionary as its size gets large

i definitely wouldn t try introducing a new general-purpose type for use in python based on std map which has worse algorithmic complexity in time for many important operations andâ in at least some implementationsâ leaves some optimisations to the user that dictionary already has


faster 5-40ã setting
shows a dictionary running 5-40ã faster than a map in the very similar setting of counting the frequencies on ints as a function of the number of unique keys

if it was any other language i feel like using a map would be faster but because it s javascript initializing a dictionary and then evaluating seems like it ll be slower than just doing a o n 2 loop


array method pairs
the difference between a map and vector is a like an array while a map is more a dictionary of key value pairs

note my implementation of map on dictionary returns a copy of the dictionary to be more like the map method of array


pyquery	lxml---------------------------------------------------

others
pyquery is based on lxml so it s also much faster than beautifulsoup


rspec	capybara---------------------------------------------------

others
using capybara instead of rspec is a better solution for request intergration tests

i can t work out how to make capybara with rspec handle anything more than two levels before my expects


preorder	postorder---------------------------------------------------

others
if you have dynamic element sizes you can t write out child pointers in preorder so postorder traversal is more appropriate


opera	safari---------------------------------------------------

penultimate konqueror version
for comparison 0.68 usage means this outdated google-chrome release is more popular than the current and previous versions of opera the penultimate version of safari on ios and ie 9 or 10

the downside is that you cannot use it for browsers older than ie11 firefox 31 esr safari 7.1 ios 7 konqueror all versions and opera all versions


others
all my other browsers safari google-chrome and opera have newer javascript versions

works in google-chrome firefox a bit weirdish blur effect on hover opera ends look smaller safari ends look smaller

now this works fine in google-chrome and safari and i have had to use assitional css settings for firefox but ie and opera both display my ribbon div about 25px higher than in google-chrome or safari

incidentally the scrolling on the windows version of safari is fine albeit a little slower than ie opera and firefox

firefox safari google-chrome and opera make up more than 30 of the market and they support many html5 standards

usually you want to avoid solutions from browser-vendor as they ll cater toward that specific browser but opera webkit google-chrome safari firefox devs are usually more knowledgeable in terms of cross-browser solutions and compliance with the standards than m ones

in safari it is several pixels higher up than in firefox and google-chrome and significantly lower in opera

the center align property must be cascading from some other element because it s not only safari google-chrome which also uses webkit but also opera that shows the things center aligned and both safari google-chrome and opera are more standards compliant than ie and even firefox

all the webkit-based browsers safari google-chrome and opera should be closer in their rendering to each other than firefox or ie 9 separately

well unless you re targeting older than google-chrome 1.0 firefox 8.0 ie 4.0 opera 7.0 or safari 4.0 it s safe to use insertadjacenthtml

in any case vorbis clearly has the most coverage google-chrome has more of the market than safari now opera is about half of safari and obviously firefox is huge and it doesn t really have the strong opposition that theora has


tolower	toupper---------------------------------------------------

others
as a side note using toupper is more efficient than using tolower so toupper would be the way to go

you can use string.isnullorempty and toupper method is in general more accurate than tolower

we uppercase this with toupper then we add on the next 3 characters of the string starting at the 4th character which we force in to lower case with tolower

it is suggested in this so post that c# is more efficient with toupper because microsoft optimized it that way. but i ve also read this argument that converting tolower vs

so yes - toupper is more reliable than tolower

and if you have to convert to the same case to make comparisons toupper is better than tolower

toupper is better to use than tolower but i forget why


errors fallacy intial
your intial hypothesis of toupper being faster than tolower has a logical fallacy

so you can t reject the null hypothesis that tolower is as faster as toupper and thus your experiment has got errors


bash	zsh---------------------------------------------------

others
how can you get similar highlightings to zsh s less than bash s less in ubuntu

if your shell is bash or ksh or zsh it s much safer and easier to build up a command with an array rather than a string

my stackoverflow search indicates that it can be turned off by setting setopt nonomatch then zsh behaves more like bash glob the pattern and pass it to the program if no match is found

the syntax is used in bash and ksh and zsh i believe to more easily allow for embedding escape sequences in strings

it seems that zsh is more configurable than bash but also more complicated

can i configure zsh to behave more like bash on that

so no big surprise zsh being better than bash

zsh is more extensible and has a much greater focus on searching and completion than bash

update turns out that zsh implementation based on builtin compctl is much simpler than the bash implementation based on builtin complete

however bash has useful interactive features dash does not zsh is still better imho


division	logarithm---------------------------------------------------

others
the reason to go with logarithm instead of repeated division is performance while log is slower than division it is slower by a small fixed multiple


cifs	smb---------------------------------------------------

others
now if you re intending to use a remote filesystem with ofs which is the primary use-case you have to first install the relevant remote filesystem packages on the os you re using then use for example if we ve got cifs which is the newer name for smb samba


ctrlp	fuzzyfinder---------------------------------------------------

others
if you re looking for a ctrlp equivalent webstorm has a fuzzyfinder that s actually much more powerful than ctrlp


git-merge	git-rebase---------------------------------------------------

others
git-rebase creates a tidier history while git-merge back and forth may create a complex commit graph in the end


oursql	mysql-python---------------------------------------------------

others
at least for .executemany oursql seems to be more proficient than mysql-python as the sql statement is only prepared once for all submitted values

i hear oursql is nicer the mysql-python


redactor	fckeditor---------------------------------------------------

others
try django-ckeditor redactor it s more simple but redactor itself isn t free and i think fckeditor is more flexible in the configuration


inline	inlining---------------------------------------------------

compiler keyword function
generally speaking the inline keyword is used more now to allow you to violate the one definition rule when you define a function in a header than to give the compiler a hint about inlining

early inlining is the compiler s ability to inline a function early on when it sees the call costs more than the inline

the keyword inline is more about telling the compiler that the symbol will be present in more than one object file without violating the one definition rule than about actual inlining which the compiler can decide to do or not to do

the inline keyword makes it easier for the compiler to apply this optimization by allowing the function definition to be visible in multiple translation units but using the keyword doesn t mean the compiler has to inline the function and not using the keyword doesn t forbid the compiler from inlining the function

if your compiler can do this then writing functions in a way that the compiler is able to inline is better than manually inlining the calls yourself


fatter tail call
we inline the call instead inlining is way better than tail calling and opens the door to many more optimizations

inlining inlining produces fatter code which is faster the inline functions will not appear in the call stack


size smaller limit
the decision to inline is based on an estimate as to whether inlining will result in smaller code size

but as the inline code gets longer the savings for inlining become smaller so maybe you could just have a hard limit on the size of the code - any code to be inline must be smaller than the limit


others
templates will be inline in the standard meaning of inline which is more related to the one definition rule than to actual code inlining

you will probably use both in large projects - put the definitions of the functions that should be inline and templates in the header and put the ones that inlining makes less sense for in the cpp

if a function is static thus not exported anyway and only called once within your code and you never use a pointer to the function chances are good that gcc will decide to inline it automatically as it will have no negative impact the binary won t get bigger by inlining it only once

callee is too large message is printed by c1 when the size in bytecodes of the method being inline is larger than maxinlinesize 35 multiplied by nestedinliningsizeratio 90 on each next level of inlining

as a practical matter i can simply change these to static inline to get rid of the warning or turn off the specific warning entirely but i do find it useful from time to time but it seems that large utility functions which won t benefit from inlining 1 are more logically declared static 2

as pointed out you cannot inline which is another speed trick but inlining on the if-then-else tree doesnt necessarily make it faster than without inlining and is generall not as fast as the function pointer

i m well aware that inline is more of compiler decision than of user going so far as even to inlining non-specified inline-functions so the user control is almost negligible

in reality the inline keyword has less to do with inlining code and more to do with allowing legal violation of the one definition rule

a similar argument can be made for inlining functions inline is generally faster but will remain in the same big-o complexity class although there is an additional size tradeoff inlining makes your compiled program larger if the code was being used in many places

note that just as you wrote this version is significantly slower than the inline one under cpython which of course does no jit inlining


simple methods little
i have no problem with methods declared inline in a header in some cases - a struct s constructor a simple method where inlining measurably makes it faster we have some math functions like this etc

while function calls can be a little worse than inline code for very simple operations repeated inlining of non-trivial functions can create arbitrarily worse code bloat


teamcity	nant---------------------------------------------------

others
if you are taking a more open source approach such as teamcity cruisecontrol then nant may be better

you could use nant to send email but teamcity is more appropriate as it can provide a centralized place for notifications including emails


haskell	scheme---------------------------------------------------

others
scheme is perhaps more approachable than haskell however

once you get more familiar with haskell you will be able to rewrite standard recursion scheme such as the one above in a more compact form exploiting a few higher order library functions

i really like thompsonâ s â œhaskell the craft of functional programmingâ because itâ s well written and haskell allows an easier start than other functional languages while being completely pure unlike lisp or scheme

some background i m learning haskell now having earlier worked with scheme and cl and a little foray into clojure

i personally believe that it is not worth the effort because basic is a nearly dead language and there are lots of languages better than basic ocaml haskell common lisp clojure scala scheme go d ...


lxml	html5lib---------------------------------------------------

slower rate faster
lxml is the faster parser and can handle broken html quite well html5lib comes closest to how your browser would parse broken html but is a lot slower

the standard html.parser option handles broken html less well than other options while the html5lib option is closest to how a modern browser would handle broken html albeit at a slower rate than lxml would handle html parsing


others
lxml parser is generally faster html5lib is the most lenient one - this kind of difference would be relevant if you have a broken or non-well-formed html to parse

html5lib parser does a better job than lxml or html.parser handling the debate element in this case

if for some reason you want to use an implementation that does not give you a full parse tree then i would suggest parsing the resulting html using lxml a python wrapper of the c lib or html5lib pure python both of which can return an elementtree object and are much faster especially lxml and more forgiving of invalid html especially html5lib which acts more like real browsers in the real world


vim	kate---------------------------------------------------

others
if vim seems too much by the moment i think that kate is better than gedit


swt	styledtext---------------------------------------------------

others
but adding a class to swt package seems harder first because there is different jars depending on the operating system used org.eclipse.swt.cocoa org.eclipse.swt.gtk .... and also because copy pasting the code of styledtext is not that easy since there is call to external methods waiting for a strict styledtext


opcache	apc---------------------------------------------------

others
zend opcache appears to be more performant than apc more fully featured and more reliable

i am using yii 1.1.12 and recently upgraded my php from 5.3 to 5.5 and have found that apc is no longer to be used because opcache has been made part of php5.5

i don t want to use apc because opcache is around 10 faster than apc


doc	rtf---------------------------------------------------

latter files docx
i can help you for docx files rtf files are easier and doc files are quite the same as docx but less well organised

if the latter is what you want you could use rtf which is somewhat easier than the doc format


others
there s a post on the subject on the birt world blog here specifically relating to xls emitters although the tribix emitters mentioned should also enable output to rtf a microsoft format readable by word that is much more concise than doc


glassfish	resin---------------------------------------------------

others
glassfish seems to be slower than resin

i have previous jsp experience but with using tomcat and resin and i would like to connect to a mysql database using glassfish and hoped that more or less copy and pasting the code would work


jfreechart	jchart2d---------------------------------------------------

others
as a note jchart2d is way better than other libraries as jfreechart for real time applications


suppressfinalize	finalizer---------------------------------------------------

others
calling suppressfinalize on an object implementing a finalizer does nothing more than set a bit in the objects header which the runtime checks when calling finalizer which will suppress your finalizer from running


cassette	squishit---------------------------------------------------

others
another project you might want to look at is cassette which pretty much does everything squishit does and more


ctime	strftime---------------------------------------------------

others
the c format is the same as is used by ctime but strftime is more flexible


idictionary	icollection---------------------------------------------------

others
idictionary and ilist are more specialized interfaces that extend icollection


typedef	typename---------------------------------------------------

others
they describe intent better than built-in typename do typedef int errcode


armadillo	eigen---------------------------------------------------

others
i find eigen s syntax more cumbersome than the other numerical linear algebra libraries i ve worked with numpy matlab and armadillo

i have recently started to use eigen version 3.3.1 running a benchmark against armadillo on a simple matrix operation at the core of an ols regression that is computing the inverse of the product of a matrix by itself i noticed that eigen was running slower when compiled with mkl library than without it for this kind of operation


datamapper	activerecord---------------------------------------------------

logic standard thread-safe
both use the activerecord pattern so you ll actually get your database tables back in objects without fancy domain logic but datamapper is way easier to work with and is thread-safe

datamapper is potentially more complex then activerecord but it s a lot easier to develop your domain model and database asynchronous then with activerecord

from my point of view the datamapper model is much easier to grasp but since activerecord is the defacto standard it feels weird to change the orm just for this little problem


newer better idea
datamapper is newer than activerecord

so a question for those who know better is datamapper newer than activerecord

so far the only legitimate reason i ve found to use datamapper over activerecord is that datamapper is better in terms of the single responsibility principle -- because the database rows are not the actual objects being persisted but with propel that doesn t really concern me because it s generated code anyway

datamapper idea is definitely better than activerecord


others
the level of abstraction of datamapper is way higher than the activerecord s

i don t know whether this port of cql3 to ruby support activerecord it acts more like a simple datamapper but it worths having a look

activerecord is much simpler then a datamapper but also much more limited

i have searched it in google but most of the articles talk about how to use database cleaner gem with activerecord but none of them clearly specify how to use databasecleaner gem with datamapper

i d recommend datamapper for orm not only it s way faster than activerecord but it s also very modularly built and plugins are actual gems that you can easily install

also datamapper is much more ruby syntax friendy and features like lazy loading when doing chainable conditions like activerecord in rails 3 are there from the beginning

datamapper is much smarter then activerecord

with datamapper this is somewhat more work than with activerecord which provides it s own db tasks

codeignitter is using activerecord something that uses datamapper could be faster not sure if you can change that though most probably you can havent use codeignitter


addclass	removeclass---------------------------------------------------

others
using addclass would be a better call hence we could removeclass from the tr selector before we stripe the table


tvos	ios---------------------------------------------------

others
tvos is more similar to ios than it is to watchos although they all have some similarities


gam	mgcv---------------------------------------------------

others
if you want loess-based smooths in the gam try package gam but mgcv has a wider range of penalised regression splines and has a more modern approach to smoothness selection in the individual splines

i try to fit a gam using the gam package i know mgcv is more flexible but i need to use gam here


nstableview	nssplitview---------------------------------------------------

others
a pattern i also use is to make the nstableview slightly shorter than the nssplitview and have buttons at the bottom add delete etc


mergesort	heapsort---------------------------------------------------

assumption reason faster
normally quicksort is faster than mergesort which is faster than heapsort

heapsort tends to be slower than mergesort for the same reason.

typically mergesort is slower than heapsort and quicksort but that s usually under the assumption that comparisons are fast


others
what baffles me is that my mergesort seems to be slower than heapsort in both of the languages


xstream	xom---------------------------------------------------

others
but if convenience is more important than efficiency yes you probably should consider a tree model not dom necessarily xom is better for example or data binding jaxb or xstream


nonetype	iterable---------------------------------------------------

others
since the definition of filter is to return a list of elements in which the function returns true wouldn t filter not none iterable make more sense for filtering to a list that only includes items that aren t nonetype


icalendar	rrule---------------------------------------------------

others
it s possible for icalendar software to make this a lot shorter with rrule but these calculations are hard and not everybody implements it


opencms	magnolia---------------------------------------------------

others
however if i d built a new site with a cms on java i d probably go with magnolia cms because the documentation and community is more mature despite that it s newer than opencms


passenger	unicorn---------------------------------------------------

others
unicorn does not use less memory than passenger

the passenger whether via apache or nginx or unicorn are much more established production ready application environments

memory optimizations - phusion passenger uses less memory than thin and unicorn

sergio suggested nginx + unicorn or nginx + puma but nginx + passenger which replaces unicorn puma is much easier to setup performs great uses less memory works better and has more features

i m more familiar with unicorn but based on the documentation i ve read you shouldn t have to start passenger in a separate process


pbkdf2	md5---------------------------------------------------

others
so we can use pbkdf2 with sha512 to gain a very significant advantage over the phpass algorithm mainly because sha512 is a harder algorithm with more computation than md5


fgets	strcpy---------------------------------------------------

others
fgets of course does not process escape sequences any more than strcpy would


uiview	calayer---------------------------------------------------

worse better performance
is calayer better than uiview in terms of performance

i noticed calayer had worse performance than uiview


others
a uiview is no more than a fancy wrapper for a calayer â bringing uiresponder events animation conveniences among many other things

this does not work because the uiview you are subclassing i assume it is a uiview already is the delegate of its own calayer it cannot be the delegate of more than one calayer at once

in fact each uiview has even more than 1 corresponding calayer

i want to add a calayer inside an uiview and this calayer will be smaller than the uiview

this is better than using a second view a bit larger as a calayer is lighter than a uiview and you don t have do modify the frame of myview which is good for instance if myview is a uiimageview

this is possible because calayer s expose more drawing functionality than uiview s doâ layers are lower-level than views and designed explicitly for the purpose of highly-configurable drawing within the layout and like many things in cocoa are designed to be used flexibly as a parent class or as a delegator or as a bridge to other drawing systems or just on their own

i am using calayer s because as suggested in documentation calayer s are lighter than uiview and i have hundreds of them

does that mean the the view controller has multiple uiview or that the uiview has more than one calayer

a uiview is no more than a wrapper for an underlying calayer


free	memcpy---------------------------------------------------

others
you d be better off with memcpy which is probably close to what your compiler gives you for free if you just write the class the normal naive way with no std array and no pointer gymnastics

in the case of overflow a free malloc pair costs less than realloc because of its internal hidden memcpy


viewdidload	viewdidappear---------------------------------------------------

better method viewwillappear
you could try the block of code in the viewdidload method which is called earlier than viewdidappear

you may find using viewdidload rather than viewwillappear or viewdidappear may work better in this case you can set your view up with a loading holding graphic or animation trigger your asynchronous networking call and then once complete display the required information

so viewdidload is called slightly earlier than viewdidappear the only difference is that when viewdidappear the view have been already drawn instead in viewdidload the view has still to be drawn


others
actually as per view life cycle the methods are called in following manner init loadview viewdidload viewwillappear viewwilllayoutsubviews called more than once viewdidlayoutsubviews called multiple time and lastly viewdidappear

i agree with the other answer that it shouldn t be in viewdidload - you ve got no guarantee the view has been added to your window at that point viewdidappear is a better place

it works perfect and i ve been able to call it from viewdidload which was quicker than calling the deprecated thumbnailimageattime from the viewdidappear

also making the network request in viewdidload will be faster as it called before viewdidappear - but keep in mind viewdidload is only called once for a specific instance of a viewcontroller where as viewdidappear is called every time that instance is displayed again eg

also don t present modal vc from self at viewdidload at the time of this method execution the vc is often not yet presented itself viewdidappear is more fitting for such tests


printf	strncpy---------------------------------------------------

others
when ever you do string copying do not allow destination buffer overflow make it impossible to happen one way or another note be careful if you use strncpy it is not guaranteed to add terminating n so strncat or printf may be easier to use


memmove	strncpy---------------------------------------------------

others
if you know the lengths of the strings memmove is a sensible choice - and nominally faster than strncpy because it does not have to check for nulls as it goes


express	hapijs---------------------------------------------------

others
we started experimenting with hapijs on smaller services and kind of like it more than express


jax-ws	jax-rs---------------------------------------------------

others
jax-rs is much younger than jax-ws jax-ws had a final draft in 2006 jax-rs came out in 2008-9

people typically find jax-rs easier to start with and the more modern approach although jax-ws has more build-in type-safety features which is also exactly where most of its complexity comes from


mockito	jmock---------------------------------------------------

others
i suggest that you to move jmock which has a better api or even to mockito whose protocol is even simpler

much as i used to love jmock i have to agree with the comments that mockito is far friendlier to use

for the record jmock as of today supports more complex scenarios than mockito that s why the initial learning curve is steeper


arc4random	srand---------------------------------------------------

others
from what i can gather arc4random generates much better random numbers than rand does however i haven t seen a way to seed it and i would like to just like using srand

results are quite stable srand and 999999999 iterations of rand takes around 6 s while arc4random takes much longer around 30 s


comparator	comparable---------------------------------------------------

sort error use
that said using a standard sort with either comparable rows or a comparator is much better than mixing up the sort logic and the comparison logic

if you didn t implement comparable and didn t supply a comparator it is much better to error out than to just silently sort your list in semi-random order

a comparator class is better since use of comparable would mean using


others
using comparator instead of putting all the logic directly in the comparable gives you more flexibility in the order that things are compared in

this solution is cleaner than implementing comparable by your dto because you can create and use many comparator acording to your needs

your case sounds like one where creating a comparator would be more appropriate than implementing comparable the latter is specifically for modelling a natural order of instances of the class

in conceptual sense a comparator is the comparison operator the logic used to determine whether a comparable is greater lesser than another comparable

comparator does everything that comparable does plus more

very comparable as a string comparator that accepts o and o and ã³ to be equal

using just the keyfn return a comparable value that matches your requirements is much easier than implementing comparator


crypt	md5---------------------------------------------------

others
mac os x llvm gcc based crypt fuction is borked junk hardwired to only use des a proven breakable hash worse than md5

i should also mention that crypt has this built-in and may be a better solution than md5

crypt with hash is simply more expensive than md5


zsh	subshell---------------------------------------------------

others
simple function in zsh to parallelize jobs in not more than 4 subshell using lock files in tmp


luis	api.ai---------------------------------------------------

others
my team is more experienced with api.ai and only starting to learn luis


javassist	bcel---------------------------------------------------

others
here in so i found a lot of questions asking something similar and the answers normally said you can use cglib or asm or javassist is better than cglib or bcel is old and is dying or asm is the best because it gives x and y


setinterval	clearinterval---------------------------------------------------

method simpler cleaner
i find this method simpler than using clearinterval to pause and setinterval again to restart

this is perhaps a bit cleaner with a setinterval instead of a clearinterval


others
my solution was to increase the settimeout to create a bigger delay before the next part of the script commenced but also to add an additional clearinterval as the top line of the script running within the setinterval

but with setinterval combined with clearinterval it is more straightforward

as for me settimeout is simpler than setinterval in this case as you won t need to clearinterval in the end of the array


r-tree	quadtree---------------------------------------------------

others
there are other multidimensional trees that are usually better than kd-trees quadtree r trees like r-tree but much faster for updates or ph-tree

you can also try a quadtree it has some better perfomance over a r-tree

on the other hand the wikipedia article on r-tree seems more specifically targeted towards mapping than the k-d tree or quadtree

a quadtree is a simpler data structure than the r-tree

i use quadtree more than r-tree and find them super flexible

if your objects are sparse then a quadtree or related data structure r-tree etc. is probably better

i believe instead of r-tree a point quadtree would be more effective for your need


window queries neighbours
r-tree are much faster than quadtree for nearest neighbours queries

r-tree are substantially faster than quadtree for window queries like inside contains covers etc

quadtree indexes are created faster than r-tree


easier fast faster
maybe a r-tree or a quadtree can be faster

quadtree are easier to implement r-tree can be twice as fast than quadtree


sin	math.h---------------------------------------------------

others
and my test result show it s more accurate than math.h s sin cos at -m_pi angle +m_pi range


pandas	bcolz---------------------------------------------------

others
i haven t played around with it recently but i think bcolz is more flexible here in terms of mixing dtypes but doesn t give you all the pandas dataframe conveniences obviously


jboss	glassfish---------------------------------------------------

others
well glassfish is more right than jboss and weblogic business-bean-classes should all have their own ejb-local-interface

jboss has a larger community than glassfish

many containers such as jboss provide more complex alternative transaction managers which support concepts like nested transactions but others like glassfish do not

i tried jboss too but i think glassfish is easier to use

jboss is a big and quite complex application and glassfish is smaller and i find it easier to understand

as for me jboss implementation is smaller than the whole glassfish so i m using

in weblogic and glassfish you ll be better inspired by deploying the native ibm jca resource adapter and creating jndi resources then referenced in the spring context as above in jboss a direct mq client bean declaration suits best as below

but in my location jboss is more popular than glassfish so i have a idea

glassfish however performs better than jboss and has a very slick gui-based admin console whereas jboss can only be administrated with a command line

even if jboss is the better product in my next project i will shift to glassfish because of the better documentation

in my opinion glassfish is more user friendly than jboss so i decided use glassfish for my project

glassfish v3 vs jboss 7.0 in using in production environment i know more people use jboss the application server but glassfish has more features and stability over jboss


production deployments alternative
i think glassfish is a better j2ee app server to start with than jboss

afaik jboss is much more adopted in production deployments than glassfish but this doesn t necessarily mean it s better

but if you want a full-fledged java ee 6 server then glassfish 3 or jboss 6 is a better alternative


highcharts	canvasjs---------------------------------------------------

others
also with refresh time of 5 seconds canvasjs rendering was allot more responsive then highcharts


negative-number	zero---------------------------------------------------

others
numbers less than zero however you might use the more descriptive negative-number tag


maven	m2e---------------------------------------------------

others
the problem i found with the m2e though was that it always got so horribly ridiculously go-have-a-coffee-break-while-you-wait-for-it slow performance when the maven project became larger adding more and more sub-projects

the eclipse builder uses simpler logic than maven so sometimes the things m2e does are just not enough

with 0.13 m2e this no longer works as the maven builder appears to put things in target your-artificat-version-snapshot web-inf classes

maven 2 has a steeper learning curve but provides a much richer set of functionality for building your projects and eclipse integration through m2e or iam

in other words m2e is more friendly to the maven way

that way of adding dependencies is better managed by maven with m2e

m2e is also a platform that let others provide better integration with additional maven plugins android web development etc.


likely advanced wtp
as far as i remember the support of wtp was removed from the plugin since the maven eclipse m2e plugin got more advanced

moreover i m using m2e the maven plugin for eclipse so it seems that the compatibility of any maven plugins that might work by themselves is even less likely with m2e


strlen	strdup---------------------------------------------------

others
you can use either to create a new memory block which is separate from the original but naturally strdup is simpler since it doesn t require a separate malloc strlen call

as i noted in comments however if you re willing to rely on posix s strdup then that s cleaner than strlen + malloc + and has the same semantics you take responsibility for freeing the memory allocated for the copy


convenient memcpy strcpy
because of the above replace strdup with strlen malloc memcpy memcpy is slightly faster than strcpy

additionally if you have strdup then it is much more convenient than strlen + malloc + strcpy with identical result including the same obligation to free the allocated storage when you no longer need it


alloca	malloc---------------------------------------------------

others
while alloca gives you automatic de-allocation on function exit the stack is usually a smaller resource than the malloc heap and if you exhaust the heap it gives you back null


strtol	strcmp---------------------------------------------------

others
once you ve done that you can use strcmp to see if the string is equal to stop and if not then call atoi or better yet strtol which has better error checking to get the numerical value


bazaar	svn---------------------------------------------------

others
bazaar seems much more like svn with branches just being separate directories so maybe not

that makes bazaar behave more like svn in that every commit automatically goes to the server and you can t forget to push

now i want to work on this read-only also i have better experience with bazaar than svn so i want to change this repository from svn to a bazaar repository for working locally how can i do that and one additional thing does svn support local repositories like bazaar


matlab	s-function---------------------------------------------------

others
my c s-function is faster than my embedded matlab function block in matlab environment but when i use it in rt-lab the embedded is faster


bacon.js	rxjs---------------------------------------------------

others
on average faster than rxjs 4 kefir bacon.js as fast as rxjs 5 and slower than most.js


tablelayout	margins---------------------------------------------------

others
you can use gridbaglayout instead of gridlayout to divide the components in rows and columns just like tablelayout that gives you more control on grid width height margins padding column rows etc


rtp	sip---------------------------------------------------

others
internet telephony is a lot more than sip - rtp rtcp sdp on-device audio handling etc.


mouseleave	mousedown---------------------------------------------------

others
this may make for various race conditions and may necessitate using events which give you earlier notification than mouseup mousedown mouseenter mouseleave mouseover mouseout


debugdiag	w3wp---------------------------------------------------

others
use the link below to understand how you can hook your w3wp process it is user mode proces with debugdiag and collect more info about the crash


stringtemplate	xtend---------------------------------------------------

others
please consider also to use xtend for code generation that s much nicer than stringtemplate and integrates smoothly with xtext infrastructure


pyramid	web2py---------------------------------------------------

others
frameworks like flask cherrypy pyramid or even web2py might be the easier ones to start with


fseek	fread---------------------------------------------------

others
you fseek to offset x whatever data is buffered is now useless you fread 100 bytes and the buffered fread reads more - probably 8 kb

so i guess fseek should be much faster than fread

i probably feel fseek might be bit faster than fread as fseek changes the pointer position to the new address space that you have mentioned and there is no date read is happening


opera	firefox---------------------------------------------------

lower bit pixels
in safari it is several pixels higher up than in firefox and google-chrome and significantly lower in opera

in opera it goes little bit lower than in firefox


others
the idea is that if they are using ie then they must install google-chrome frame and if they are using less than firefox 4 or opera 11.5 then they must upgrade their browser not not sure if the way i am doing that is correct

when using a font declaration of arial firefox and ie11 show relatively huge variations while google-chrome and opera show smaller variations.

safari and opera work with the google-chrome setting but firefox and ie display the iframed page larger than google-chrome causing part of the text to be cut off

you can use font-weight 100 or lighter this is working with opera 16 and older but i do not know why the h1 tags in firefox are bolder sorry

works in google-chrome firefox a bit weirdish blur effect on hover opera ends look smaller safari ends look smaller

update under linux gentoo amd64 it s the same - opera reneders slightly larger fonts than firefox but nothing that looks odd

but if firebug donâ t enabled after launch firefox â time equal 2ms that faster than opera and google-chrome and difference between empty filled array disappears

google-chrome recent builds only and firefox are behaving very strict in this regard no matter how much content you have it will be no bigger than your viewport while opera presto behaves more like a table 100 is treated as a minimum not a maximum

firefox safari google-chrome and opera make up more than 30 of the market and they support many html5 standards

the second happened when you remove everything and starting type and hit enter different browsers behavior very differently google-chrome insert very first line as a just text node of contenteditable container and than put every new line into div opera 12.12 handle it better and it never allows remove last div node ie9-10 starting jump around and after you started again uses p tags instead of div that s not even such a disaster just inconsistency but yet the firefox is not yet even trying to change it s br behavior

for example in the classic browser share example if the firefox is at 45 i want to be rendered inside the pie distance -40 may be and where the slice is less such as opera at 6 - i want it to be shown outside with a connector

my site displays just like in need in ie and opera but in firefox i can t get via css to have font sizes smaller than firefox default minimum-font-size

firefox has even fewer as far as i know and opera has none

the center align property must be cascading from some other element because it s not only safari google-chrome which also uses webkit but also opera that shows the things center aligned and both safari google-chrome and opera are more standards compliant than ie and even firefox

the downside is that you cannot use it for browsers older than ie11 firefox 31 esr safari 7.1 ios 7 konqueror all versions and opera all versions

firefox just provides far more access to its own internals and system to the extensions so its technically possible to do more with them than with opera widgets or google-chrome extensions

well unless you re targeting older than google-chrome 1.0 firefox 8.0 ie 4.0 opera 7.0 or safari 4.0 it s safe to use insertadjacenthtml

in any case vorbis clearly has the most coverage google-chrome has more of the market than safari now opera is about half of safari and obviously firefox is huge and it doesn t really have the strong opposition that theora has


browsers size mobile
but on all of the mobile browsers i ve tried firefox google-chrome opera it s much smaller around 25 of the size specified

it s way faster on ie but other major browsers firefox google-chrome safari and opera perform better when using a container and then appending it fragment or div

all the webkit-based browsers safari google-chrome and opera should be closer in their rendering to each other than firefox or ie 9 separately


browser webkit results
the results varied from a browser to another firefox 4.0b12 is faster using but google-chrome webkit and opera is faster when using

usually you want to avoid solutions from browser-vendor as they ll cater toward that specific browser but opera webkit google-chrome safari firefox devs are usually more knowledgeable in terms of cross-browser solutions and compliance with the standards than m ones

look every browser like mozilla firefox google-chrome opera have thier own design for modal window

answers in opera was checking browser support for my page and wanted to search some stuff up. i don t get this message in my default browser google-chrome nor in internet explorer or firefox


slower better worse
it seems to be slower in google-chrome and firefox but is significantly faster in opera

apparently opera ie and firefox works better with

firefox google-chrome opera and safari all handle it better

the problem with this code is that it doesn t quite work on firefox and works even worse on opera

for example i ve read that opera and ie will fix framerates slower than firefox


div smaller etc
now this works fine in google-chrome and safari and i have had to use assitional css settings for firefox but ie and opera both display my ribbon div about 25px higher than in google-chrome or safari

why in firefox text smaller left than in google-chrome and opera right

i d support both ie still has a big chunk of the user space with firefox and others opera safari etc.. occupying a smaller percentage of the browser market

on your screenshot div width in opera is bigger than in firefox and google-chrome


hash	salt---------------------------------------------------

others
the simplest form of this is to add a salt to the user s passphrase and then feed it into sha-2 to get a 256-bit hash but ideally you want to use something like scrypt to make it harder to brute-force the passphrase

using a encypted method with a salt would be even safer but this would be a good next step past just using a md5 hash

it s simpler deals with salt for you in a completelly transparent way makes way for updates both in encryption algo and in hash time cost and comes bundled in a nice api

my initial thought is that 2 hash either using 2 different algorithms or the same algorithm twice with 2 salt would be more collision resistant

restructuring of the database to just add an salt field is better option or the only one really if your going to do it properly but you could use your currant hash field to store the salt as other person posted

the first problem is obviously the lack of a salt value which means if 2 users have the same password they will have the same hash which makes it easier to compromise multiple accounts

an hmac is a better way of adding your salt and pbkdf2 is based on hmac - see below for more detail on pbkdf2 - there s a good discussion at when is it safe to use a broken hash function

although because pbkdf2 applies your hash function a large number of times a long salt is less important than in traditional straight hashing applications. for my application i use a 32 byte random salt unique for each users account where i m hashing their password with pbkdf2

prepending a salt is also more powerful than directly setting the seed values because in addition to changing the internal state of the hash if the salt is not a multiple of the digest block size then it can also perturb the alignment with which the input is fed into the hash function

that accepts either nothing a salt or a hash that crypt made earlier which has the salt to make the hash embedded in it

i think i understand the purpose of using sha1 as it s supposed to require more cycles than md5 to hash unhash and the salt is supposed to prevent the use of rainbow tables

the hash will be no more easily guessable wherever you put the salt

you can use salt to get a more revere sengineering aware hash

however using a salt offers more protection against rainbow tables precalculated hash tables so they re still worth using

i read somewhere that adding a different salt to each hash makes it more secure

just use pbkdf2 to make your hash directly make a 64 bit 8 byte random salt use a higher iteration count 4000-10000

having looked at the existing accesses listed i can see that it doesn t appear to be using the salt md5 hash that s stated in the apache docs the hash password that s stored is different to what i m thinking i should expect the salt is significantly more than 2 characters and for security reasons i m reluctant to embed a particular password hashing algorithm in my code


intensive brute match
by using a salt value typically you want this to be a random number the hash won t match the dictionary the chance of them pre-calculating all passwords with all possible salt values is exponentially more difficult

adding a dynamic salt to each user would mean that you will have to hit a datastore to retrieve the dynamic salt and the hash version of the user s password then you will have to perform the cpu intensive hash function in your code twice -- you are hashing a hash which is less secure and more likely to have collisions

as others have mentioned you want to be careful with your hash since it s easy to do something that s not really secure h salt password is far weaker than h password salt but at the same time you want to balance the effort put into this with the value of the site content

so when i see that the salt is stored in the hash password and that you use that hash password as salt i think crypt + salt is not more secure against a brute force on output hackers who managed to steal hash passwords

in django for example passwords are hash with pbkdf2 or bcrypt but session hash use a less complex hmac and no random salt

actually you can insert the passwords as a simple md5 hash it will still work for letting the user login though it is recommended to then change the password through the front end system as the salt passwords are more secure


username cost long
the lack of salt is harder to expoit here than with password hash since the hash is not directly known

hash passwords with salt are much harder for an attacker to use than a plaintext password which they can use with the right username

the salt shall make it harder to find the original password with a rainbow-table in case someone could steal your database with the hash

if the salt is hard-coded into a popular product lookup tables and rainbow tables can be built for that salt to make it easier to crack hash generated by the product

if hash are used for more than consistency checks licensing one could use salt and encryption to increase security

now personally i generally use a salt sha-256 hash on my passwords because i thought that md4 and md5 were no longer secure and that hashing a password multiple times would just put too much strain on a server for no practical benefit

likely not as cheap as xor against n values but seems like there s possibility for better quality results at a minimal extra cost especially if the data being hash is much larger than the salt value

the more randomness and more characters your salt has the better for the hash but anything that s several characters long and random works

most attacks involve generating hash for common passwords so for reasonably complicated passwords it becomes harder especially with salt some people use usernames as salt others use randomly generated numbers

in this situation storing password hash and the salt is more secure than storing the credentials encrypted or not because an attacker would have no way of getting the password back even if he manages to get his hands on both the hash and the salt

you use a salt to make it more difficult for the attacker to get at your passwords because then he would need to know the salt so that he can use it in computing the hash for your passwords

you can safely store the salt in the db because working out a string from its hash is just as hard when you know some of the string as it is when you know none of it provided the password itself is longer than the salt and long enough and strong enough to take a long time to crack by brute force at least 6 chars with at least one case change and a number or non-alphanumeric i d say

you ll probably need to get data anyway so the unique salt is probably faster too because you won t need to calculate the hash over username

hash password + salt is better but still not good enough.

this salt is nothing more than a random arbitrary string that you concatenate to the passwords and it will make your hash password unique

it is true that randomly generated salt produce a greater amount of security but it is also true that anyone who gets access to a list of your password hash in order to crack them probably has access to your database in which case they have access to your salt

i don t know how safe could it be and how difficult is for the hacker to determinate the technique i use the thing is that the result has the same length as the hash and is harder to determinate a salt so if for any reason in the history hacker uses a rainbow table and catches a probable result it will be the wrong

salt just make it harder by forcing an attacker to hash the dictionary on a per-user effectively per-salt basis

example the salt field might only allow a 64 characters while the generated salt might be longer therefore when you save the salt it gets trimmed which ultimately changes the hash password

i get the impression that most people think that hashing salt passwords is the more secure way of handling passwords but i can t figure out a way to comply with current company operations when using hash passwords

with a salt md5 is much more secure than without but you re better off using one of the sha hash such as sha256managed

it is supposed i think that the algorithm cost and salt is used to make the life harder to hackers and if i use that my hash will be safer

i ve been reading about password hash functions and it s said use a salt to make harder the hacker s work use a height cost algorithm etc

putting the salt at the beginning is better than putting it at the end as more randomness at the beginning of hash is better than randomness at the end

as a side note from what i ve read key derivation functions pbkdf2 scrypt bcrypt are considered better more secure #1 #2 than plain salt sha-1 sha-2 hash by crypto people

in storing hash passwords is a common practice to add a nonce or a salt and is marginally true that this salt is better kept secret

using the hash value with a salt is much safer if someone breaks into your db no password is there

never store passwords instead store password hash and random salt read more

hash password by using security salt is more secure than plain text password

salt is used to add an extra level of complexity to the hash to make it harder to brute-force crack

since the hash is generated using the original long salt using a trimmed salt later would just yield an invalid hash when specifying the original password - it doesn t make it any easier to find a hash collision

if we are talking about passwords where you only need to know if the user entered the correct password or not then you could hash the passwords with a salt and compare with the database hash read more about that here link

salt sha-512 offers a higher level of security and implementing a scheme where you stretch the hash is even better do some high number of iterations of sha-512 - starting with the password+salt of course

if their original password was longer than the salt + hash you may have just reduced the security of their password assuming a good password and ignoring hash collisions

there are lists available on the internet with millions of already hash values to make hash cracking easier those are known as rainbow tables and they can be easily countered with the use of salt

personally i use sha-512 with a salt because a bigger number in the hash name means a better hash

the time to hash the salt you spend better in doing more iterations on the password hashing

keep in mind the purpose of the salt to make it harder for someone to precalculate hash codes and therefore be able to look up passwords in the case of the database being compromised

you should use a strong cryptographic hash function and a salt to make it more secure

the hash can be more secure you can have random salt for every user which makes it computationally expensive for someone to brute force attack the passwords should the database be compromised


fold	catamorphism---------------------------------------------------

others
you can give clients a type-safe interface in the form of fold but they have to be willing to write all their code in a higher-order style and since fold is a catamorphism it becomes harder to look at more than one layer at a time


copying	overwrite---------------------------------------------------

others
this option is better than simply copying the file as it allows you to overwrite an existing file but you still don t get direct access to the file s properties


ssms	sqlcmd---------------------------------------------------

others
is sqlcmd always that much faster than ssms

in ssms it takes more than 1 minute to complete while in sqlcmd it takes no longer than one second

you can also do this stuff the old fashioned way using sqlcmd from command line dbas love this for some reason but for us mortals ssms is much less of a struggle


rank	max---------------------------------------------------

others
if your rank is less than 4 it takes 0 instead it s the max part

while i think gbn s answer is probably sufficient i m wondering whether use of an over clause to establish a max date per id attribute with which to reduce the select in a where clause wouldn t be faster than a rank

i would like to return those where column clickedairbnb contains empty values and the max on the column rank is less than 2

so i want to generate rank for second set of values but starting with value greater than max from first set


root new table
every time a rank finds a larger number than that stored have it send its new max to the root rank

if no rank is lower than its number there are no gaps in the table the query returns the max number + 1


velocity	thymeleaf---------------------------------------------------

others
i m working in a spring mvc project and i want to use a template engine i originally choose apache velocity because a slideshare presentation that says it was two times faster than thymeleaf page 41 and since i m working with big tables i need to use a fast template engine does apache velocity supports html5 if not is there other template engine that supports html5 that is not thymeleaf


oncreate	setcontentview---------------------------------------------------

others
an activity that uses fragments is often little more than oncreate calling setcontentview

so for one time initialization code like setcontentview or initializing variables the oncreate event is a better place

my personal preference is to call setcontentview immediately after super.oncreate so that i know the rest of the oncreate method is less likely to break

i can make this happen with the minimal project where oncreate does nothing more than call super and setcontentview

do the following in your oncreate make suer you have setcontentview on the top which sets your xml containing the splash details


bfg-repo-cleaner	git-filter-branch---------------------------------------------------

others
but bfg-repo-cleaner is a much faster solution than git-filter-branch


debian	linux---------------------------------------------------

others
in linux the git-core debian package is much smaller and the process is much quickier

if your system linux is older like debian wheezy for example your glibc version will be older than the required one

personally i develop on the windows but deploy on debian where couldn t find the scrapyd package at all at the time i was working on it and noticed that performance of scrapy is considerably worse than on linux box so you might reconsider your target

it is widely used to have a separated tag with the postfix -alpine in it to indicate that alpine linux is used which is a much smaller base-image than the debian image


laravel	silverstripe---------------------------------------------------

others
the silverstripe cms is a great php framework better than laravel the most popular at the moment but its documenation lacking


quicksort	heapsort---------------------------------------------------

others
average asymptotic order of quicksort is o nlogn and it s usually more efficient than heapsort due to smaller constants tighter loops

the typical implementation of merge sort uses a temp array of the same size as the original array or 1 2 the size sort 2nd half into second half sort first half into temp array merge temp array + 2nd half into original array so it needs more space than quicksort which optimally only needs log2 n levels of nesting and to avoid worst case nesting a nesting check may be used and quicksort changed to heapsort this is called introsort

quicksort also has a better cache access behavior than heapsort

between quicksort and merge sort since both are type of in place sorting there is a difference between wrost case running time of the wrost case running time for quicksort is o n 2 and for heapsort it is still and for a average amount of data quicksort will be more useful

quicksort has worst case time complexity as o n 2 while others like heapsort and merge sort has worst case time complexity as o n log n ..still quicksort is considered as more fast...why

the reason heapsort is slower in practice than quicksort is due to the better locality of reference in quicksort where data elements are within relatively close storage locations

dr don t just repeat the old quicksort beats heapsort it s more complicated

if you are interested in why quicksort is faster where is a link quicksort superiority over heapsort

unless you re going to write a very good sort probably quicksort merge sort or heapsort depending on your specific needs quicksort will be better and it takes fewer lines of code

each iteration in quicksort is a lot simpler than heapsort

i was just going to say radix sort however that could be a bit above what you were looking to implement introsort is generally the accepted sorting solution for data it s a variation of quicksort that switches to heapsort when it reaches smaller sets as it s faster on smaller sets than quicksort

in other words the per-comparison-overhead of heapsort is higher than the one of quicksort


comparisons theory short
in theory quicksort is worse than heapsort

you can indeed show that on average quicksort will do more comparisons than heapsort roughly 1.44 n log 2 n for quicksort versus n log 2 n versus heapsort

it s usually better to use quicksort instead of heapsort even though heapsort is better in theory consumes o 1 extra memory and o n log n time in worst case

in short - if all we care about are comparisons heapsort is a better choice than quicksort


faster slower worst
heapsort can sort in-place and doesn t have the worst case quadratic behavior but on average is slower than quicksort in most cases

while other algorithms like merge sort and heapsort have a better worst case complexity o nlogn usually quicksort is faster - this is why it s the most common used sorting algorithm

it s quite possible that the algorithm will detect a potential worst case and switch to heapsort even though using quicksort would have been faster

for example quicksort average cost t n.log n and heapsort average cost t n.log n are both sorting algorithms with the same average cost - yet quicksort is typically much faster than heapsort

in fact the heapsort algorithm works this way first arrange a random order into heap order and then obtain a sorted order somewhat less efficient than quicksort on average

normally quicksort is faster than mergesort which is faster than heapsort

why it is said quicksort has better constant factor than heapsort and therefore quicksort is better than heapsort in average

but there are many citations of real world tests which show that heapsort is significantly slower than quicksort on average

so for instance heapsort is faster than quicksort in the worst case but slower in the average case

quicksort time complexity is typically o n log n but it s worst case is o n 2 which is avoided with the switch to heapsort since heapsort is always o n log n but slower than quicksort so it s only used to avoid o n 2

this is because quicksort is generally faster than heapsort unless the call depth becomes to deep

when you say something like heapsort should be faster than quicksort what makes you say that

however heapsort is slower than quicksort in the average case in the sense that heapsort performs c n log n whereas quicksort has d n log n performance with d being significantly smaller than c the numbers c and d are constants

however quicksort s worst-case performance is significantly worse than heapsort s is

it is a variant of heapsort which is particularly suitable for the sorting of very large amounts of data if a relatively high cost per compare operation is needed and on average better than quicksort

in practice however quicksort is usually faster then heapsort

what makes quicksort faster than heapsort in practice is its constant that was ignored by big o analysis

heapsort has higher overhead than quicksort but its worst case is o n log n vs

heapsort has a better big-o than say quicksort yet quicksort performs much better in practice

for example quicksort is faster than heapsort in general although their time complexity are the same

but heapsort is assumed to be on average somewhat slower than standard in-place quicksort

so normaly you could use heapsort but most times quicksort is faster

because heapsort is actually slower than quicksort for each n

in the event that the quicksort starts to degenerate it uses heapsort which is o n log n worst-case but slightly slower than quicksort on average to guarantee o n log n worst-case runtimes

worst case for quicksort is actually worse than heapsort and mergesort but quicksort is faster on average

however heapsort is somewhat slower in practice on most machines than a well-implemented quicksort

the difference is large enough that the constant factor in front of the n log n term in quicksort is lower than the constant factor in front of the n log n term in heapsort which is one reason why quicksort is much faster than heapsort

if i do heapsort i can create the stack while i m sorting but would this be faster than a quicksort and then build the stack afterwords

in their respective worst cases heapsort is faster than quicksort

so for even small inputs quicksort does less work than heapsort and is physically faster for every n

for 5 000 000 ints still stored in memory quicksort becomes suddenly worse then heapsort and mergesort

asymptotic analysis reveals order of growth of heapsort in the worst case is big-o n logn which is better than quicksort s big-o n 2 as a worst case

but quicksort will execute faster because its constant factors are smaller than the constant factors for heapsort

from what i heard quicksort should have better average case performance but from my tests it performs 4 times worse than heapsort for array of random integers


quicker selection insertion
in theory insertion sort and quicksort are worse than heapsort

after several tests i found out that my heapsort is way quicker than quicksort i think it should be the other way around my selection sort is also faster than insertion sort


des	aes---------------------------------------------------

better effective example
according to this analysis aes rijndael-128 is more than twice as fast as des 3des with a bigger key size more secure

des is the least secure 3des is better but i d go for the aes

if you used aes then you might see a better speedup over the des 3des observations

i ve read that aes encryption is more secure than the triple des encryption ms is using in their example above

i know you said you don t care about how secure it is but if you chose des you might as well take aes it is the more up-to-date encryption method

you re using des in your example which is a flawed and obsolete algorithm alternatively use 3des so i suggest moving to aes which provides better encryption

note that the effective key size of aes is larger than triple des


sensitive current little
this shows that the timings are sensitive to buffering and that aes is faster than des

aes will indeed yield a considerably faster result than des

aes can be even much faster than des or 3des when the cpu supports aes-ni

if aes is negotiated it s faster than des and 3des used by default by older applications

des is usually substantially slower than aes on modern hardware and has keys that are far too short for modern use

using des assuming it s a little faster than aes and requires a smaller key and

des turned out to be even slower than aes but for my current requirements a much simpler algorythm rc4 is sufficient


others
the original des designers were genius but one could say that the aggregate effort of cryptographers for the aes has been far greater

turns out this was a hardware failure the aes commands need more power than the des crypto1 ones 50 more which the antenna failed to deliver at the reading range i was testing with

how ever if you insist to use some api in java i have to say that des is really old way to encrypted text 3des desede or aes will be better and safer both of them have already been supported since java6

also see why aes is more secure than des

which steps of aes encryption makes it less vulnerable than des

though it s unrelated to your actual question des is generally slower than aes at least in software so unless you really need to keep the key small aes is almost certainly a better choice


ansible	puppet---------------------------------------------------

others
if you just expect puppet to restart httpd simple because you asked it to then you either need to use a program like ansible which is more of an actual task manager or use some kind of inotify thing to see that a certain file has been changed so httpd must be restarted

puppet chef always have a place in my heart stack but ansible is just easier

ansible is in an earlier stage than chef puppet and other tools out there when it comes to community support


general agent cfengine
puppet chef ansible cfengine are more general configuration management tools that can be used on almost all linux os-es

ansible unlike chef and puppet uses agent less run


fast-forward	merge---------------------------------------------------

others
or whatever you branched from so the resulting history will appear i started from later version and the merge back will probably be fast-forward it s easier to work with especially since you are rewriting the actual history to logical changesets anyway

if all goes well and people only added stuff on top of your feature branch your suggested merge should only do a fast-forward and keep morefeaturework up to date

qa verifies functionality and approves or disapproves it then i m verifying code and if it is ok i merge his work into master by fast-forward or rebasing for better commits history


uialertview	uialertcontroller---------------------------------------------------

others
however take some time to consider how you re currently using uialertview and whether you are able to give ios 8 users a better experience by supporting uialertcontroller

but in your case alertview is displayed above alertcontroller ie why it feels like uialertview is whitier than uialertcontroller

i d like the uitextfield in a uialertcontroller look like the old uialertview rounded corners lighter gray


rational-numbers	zero---------------------------------------------------

others
is there any way in haskell to get the constant that is the largest and smallest possible positive rational-numbers greater than zero that can be represented by doubles


tree-shaking	es2015---------------------------------------------------

others
es2015 module is more efficient than the other formats and can facilitate the creation of smaller bundle size through tree-shaking technique importing just the bits you need instead of importing the whole thing


groupbox	panel---------------------------------------------------

others
put a group of controls for which you would later call findsize ... under the same parent a panel for example or a groupbox whichever makes more sense to you

if you have other containers like panels or groupbox inside that panel that contain more buttons these buttons are not enumerated this way


memcpy	strcpy---------------------------------------------------

performance difference efficient
performance difference memcpy is usually more efficient than strcpy which must scan the data it copies

memset behaves like strcpy but the difference is that memcpy copied the data as it is byte but strcpy copies the formatted string as well so takes more time than memcpy to execute


others
if size is known normally a non-naive implementation of memcpy is faster than strcpy since it takes profit of the cpu s data bus size

structures are also memcpy ied by some newbie programmers because they either confuse structure assignment with the assignment of a pointer of a structure - or they simply overuse memcpy they often also use memcpy where strcpy would be more appropriate

the reason for not having strcpy i m guessing is that strcpy can be replaced more efficiently with memcpy for constant strings and if the string is not constant strcpy is a bit more complicated than memcpy anyway so not as beneficial to make inline optimisations for

your macro with memset and memcpy was not any safer than strcpy

the proper way to copy strings is using strcpy or strcpy_s on windows the difference is memcpy is faster and used in other situations such as pointers buffer management

memcpy can be more efficient than strcpy since rep movs is highly optimized on intel cpus esp


buffer platforms strlen
because of the above replace strdup with strlen malloc memcpy memcpy is slightly faster than strcpy

memcpy is usually faster than strcpy for longer strings

on almost any platform memcpy is going to be faster than strcpy when copying the same number of bytes

information - use memcpy as it s faster than strcpy and we know

is memcpy usually faster than strcpy on most real platforms

but sometimes memcpy performs faster than strcpy because it moves blocks of memory at a time which allows it to perform some optimization i will not go into details here

notice that memcpy is faster than strcpy unless the source string is much smaller than the buffer s size which is rarely the case with ip addesses.

we keep track of what cmd s length ought to be in a variable and copy the string with memcpy which is slightly faster than strcpy and does neither check string length nor copy the extra zero at end of string

for example for small amounts of data an memcpy optimised for large amounts of data may be significantly slower than a strcpy that wasn t optimised for large amounts of data

memcpy is rarely slower than strcpy or strncpy and often significantly faster

so i feel that on x86 memcpy is faster than strcpy

you could use memcpy memset for strings too but strcpy is simpler

memcpy can be faster than strcpy and strncpy because it does not have to compare each copied byte with 0 and because it already knows the length of the copied object

memcpy is not really any slower than strcpy

memcpy is faster than strcpy and also enforces you to specify a buffer size


free	malloc---------------------------------------------------

values dosomething earlier
you should know that strdup allocates more memory and returns its pointer which you then overwrite the original pointer returned by malloc so it will be impossible to free that memory since you no longer have the pointers

now if you free some values on the heap and allocate more with malloc you may be given back some of that dirtied memory that you scribbed on earlier

how does free know how much memory to be free d which was earlier allocated by malloc or calloc

allocating more memory with malloc does not prevent the memory error if the free call inside the dosomething method is incommented

malloc finds 10 more free bytes and marks them as used

secondly i notice that when i run my program i m seeing the free function call more often than the malloc calloc calls 98 to 16

suppose char p malloc n assigns more than n say n bytes of memory are allocated and free p is used to free the memory allocated to p

one interesting experiment you can try is to try and malloc more memory after you free d that pointer


others
further you are passing pointers to free which are no more returned by malloc family functions

most likely malloc allocates more memory and puts so-called guard values that happen to contain null bytes or it puts some metadata to be used by free later and this metadata happens to contain a null byte right at that position

malloc is much easier to implement if there is no free

presumably the mac malloc aligns to bigger boundaries and so it s spotting the pointer you re passing to free can t be correct since it has the wrong alignment

passing 0 to malloc either returns null or special pointer which can be used to call free it is better to make it initialize simply with null or better an empty string with a 0 character

there is no garentee that an access out of bounds of an array will produce a seg fault as it could be part of a different array that was malloc ed earlier or part of free space that the standar library is keeping track of for future allocations and therefore will not segfault

on linux these syscalls are often mmap 2 perhaps with sbrk 2 and since linux systems are mostly free software you could actually study and improve the implementation of malloc musl libc implementation of malloc the more common gnu libc malloc implementation is perhaps more complex to understand

remember malloc is quite expensive action and free costs even much more than malloc

if you want better guarantees about zeroing or to get free zeroing on smaller allocations though it s more wasteful the closer to one page you get you can just explicitly do what malloc calloc do implicitly and use the os provided zero-ed memory replace

here is a solution which encapsulates the call to malloc allocates a bigger buffer for alignment purpose and stores the original allocated address just before the aligned buffer for a later call to free

in addition to the previous answers the strncpy char pointer which seems unsafe for my opinion and the malloc which is safer but you need to remember to free it outside of the function and its inconsistent with the hierarchy of the program you can do the following

i m not totally sure what you are asking malloc minus free is less than the actual usage because of the memory fragmentation if you really need that number you have to use custom allocators which are tiny wrappers around existing ones everywhere in your code which is going to be painful

but as programs grow and structs deepen keeping track of what s been malloc d where and what s appropriate to free gets harder and harder

as long as malloc can allocate it you can fill it up with fread although fread is free to read a smaller number of elements

additionally if you have strdup then it is much more convenient than strlen + malloc + strcpy with identical result including the same obligation to free the allocated storage when you no longer need it


operations track os
the justification of realloc is that it s faster than 2nd malloc manual copy free

in c you would use malloc to get memory realloc to get more memory and free to release memory

you could have some initial guess for maxsize 8 and grow when needed your data perhaps by using realloc or just by malloc -ing a bigger new chunk copying the older chunk inside then free -ing that older chunk

a realloc can occur significantly faster than a malloc memcpy and free

you know -- operations such as new or malloc actually consume more memory than they allocate -- the system uses their own tree structures to keep track of where memory is free and where it is not

generally new delete and malloc realloc free arrange for more memory from the os using sbrk or os-specific-equivalent and divide the pages up however they like to satisfy the program s allocation requests


gridview	objectdatasource---------------------------------------------------

others
from what i ve read the gridview control plays a lot nicer with the objectdatasource


short	base---------------------------------------------------

others
in fact some would argue that any comment is a code smell and that descriptive names and short routines are more readable and prevent the situation where code has been changed but the comments haven t been updated which has certainly bitten me in a few legacy code base

in short it s worse design to move things to the base class than it is to downcast to the specific class

as the condition reads a loop can not be zipped tighter if it s either too short less than five base or its ends do not match

the short version is that having concrete base classes makes it easier to accidentally slice off your child object use arrays incorrectly


mongoid	mongomapper---------------------------------------------------

others
over the last year it looks like mongoid has been more regularly maintained and updated than mongomapper

i prefer mongomapper for 2.3.x projects but mongoid has seemed much more stable for me in rails 3 projects


pull	push---------------------------------------------------

mechanism message suitable
using signalr is not a good idea because signalr using push mechanism to notify but it seems in your case some pull method is more suitable and also signalr doesn t support really permanent queue to keep messages in queue while consumers being ready

if in-order processing is required a much better design would be to use another message processing library that supports a pull model which i think would fit your scenario much better than rebus push model

a heartbeat mechanism pull model is definitely easier to implement but a push model is far more efficient


scalable starters
i have found that pull is more scalable than push

why do you think that push is far more scalable then pull for starters


subscriptions notification iphones
how are push notification better than pull notification on iphones

is the performance of pull better than push in this scenario

before do git pull and git push it s better to make sure that git status result is contain text working directory clean

as stated by other answers neither push nor pull is better but rather you should pick the one that best fits your design needs

pull subscriptions perform much better than push subscriptions in a wan scenario

i guess one of them is that the push model is less coupled then the pull model

the reason the pull model works better than the push model in this case is as follow


others
i guess i m just surprised that the documentation recommends the approach of querying presumably continually in my case versus keeping a tailable cursor open i would have thought that push would be cheaper than pull

at both events forstall stated that push notifications were a better means to maintain battery life than background processes which are used for pull technology as far as receiving notifications are concerned

if you don t understand the subtleties between push vs pull architecture then i recommend that you start with xmlreader because pull is simpler to understand and easier to visualize

a little more pull than push style that s because there is no duplicate item.

alone push is better in the accepted answer can t quite work as a push-operation in some class can require a new pull at the pushed object

i create new branch add those new features and than i once again made pull request but now the features i implemented in the master branch are also in my new branch so my second pull request has more features than i want to push to the original project

there is a certain irony here given that within xslt push stylesheets are generally more idiomatic than pull stylesheets

update db pull and db push have been deprecated and should be replaced with pg pull and pg push - read more at

is there a way to register that user connection and act more as a push if new values exist in the server rather than every user pull new values every 1 sec for example

pull requests are more complicated because in order to make a pull request you must either open your repository to someone else who can run git pull 2 â this is where the term comes from and is the original meaning of pull request â or else find or create a shared repository push some of your commits to this shared location and then ask the other person to obtain your commits from the shared location

push models have higher throughput than pull models


client-side	server-side---------------------------------------------------

easier method file
i think this method of manipulating the dom from the client-side is easier than using regex from a server-side language

this would be easier with server-side php plug-in s unless the file is loaded client-side

maintaining the focus client-side will be much easier than trying to force it through the server-side

but i was working on server-side and probably for client-side it s much easier


others
my guess is that server-side implementation may turn out to be more flexible and more powerful than client-side as i can add functionality to the server easily as long as the client understands it

since eventually i d have a button that runs some script on the smeow values and send it to a different request i had a look at the tabletools plugin but it doesn t really play well with server-side tabletools is more focused on the client-side source

a lot of the solutions i ve seen are client-side - i think a server-side solution makes more sense for my needs since i can give feedback to the user if the javascript is invalid and only save it on the server once it s clean

it seems simpler to me because i m more experienced with server-side than client-side development

to that extent i had to make a few changes to my server-side presentation layer but as a result i think my client-side code is cleaner and more focused on processing actual user events

are client-side binding grids better than the server-side ones

since servers omit the working copy you should generally expect server-side bare repositories to be smaller than client-side non-bare repositories

i ve found that rendering client-side is nice for small controlled internal uses but for anything where you want tight control over the output server-side is more reliable

not all of the reasons given are necessarily valid but one important one is that unless you re google server-side cpu cycles are a lot more valuable than client-side cycles so it s easier to have the client compile optimize what is quite often dynamically generated html javascript rather than the server

is there a way to load it in node.js or is there another proxy that can be used to monitor changes in array for server-side code that will work far greater than client-side code as it will be receiving yuge requests

as a general rule of thumb at least in security you should trust no user so i think it would be the wise choice to validate the data client-side it s also faster and then if the first validation passed validate it server-side to double-check or to have a safety net if the user has javascript turned off something you don t see that often

so you do have to be careful not to lose track of what code is client-side and what is server-side which is slightly more difficult when both types of code use the same language but is still not very hard

using a slow hash with a cost factor is mandatory usually it is done server-side because client-side languages are slower and can do less rounds

while not really a console skulpt.org runs python code client-side with no plugins or anything which makes it a lot faster than a server-side prompt

client-side will also be more responsive than server-side because there s no request-response but that s really only a perceived performance issue for high-latency connections

finally after figuring out what i needed was a page access token i gave up trying to do this client-side realising server-side makes more sense at least security wise

in theory encoding client-side is no more dangerous than encoding server-side

now if you aren t generating your html server-side and are instead writing it by hand you can make your life just a dash easier with a client-side transformation like this

storing that info on the server-side is probably more common with the client-side only given his the session cookie

client-side validations can be overriden hacked thus server-side are more secure

that said client-side javascript is much more common and if you were using server-side javascript you would probably know the answer to your question

the server-side way is more reliable and browser-independent while the client-side approach will decrease the amount of incoming traffic to server

server-side checks are better than client-side

first vb.net can be used to perform this xslt transformation which is really simple as you said just applying the xslt stylesheet at server-side if it is considered better than at client-side or even just sending the processing instruction for that to the browser

the problem is that the server-side selectedindexchanged event triggers earlier than the client-side change event so the data never reaches the server-side

jspm is more commonly used to bring in client-side front-end libraries and npm for server-side ones

this approach isn t working because you re trying to build the page server-side then expect input client-side then do some more server-side work to build the page

as most everybody said the client-side considerations are sharper -- unless you want to try a server-side generator of client-side code like gwt i m told the latter works well but personally i m always wary of code generators esp

if getting these in sync is an issue make the client-side timer shorter than the server-side one

i know i can do a client-side redirect with html but i understand that the server-side redirect is nicer

in this case your server-side and message transfer will be quicker but your client-side will be slower


faster validation slower
since you don t want to repeat yourself it s very tempting to put all your validation on one side or the other but there are tradeoffs either way and it is true that server-side validation is going to be slower than client-side

client-side validation is faster than server-side because the validation takes place on client side on browser and the networking time from client to server is saved

because merges are performed client-side they are much faster and less error-prone than initiating a server-side merge


script execution ps
ps again i am aware that relying on client-side script is way less secure compared with handling all execution from within the server-side

i am curious to know if detecting the visitor browser with client-side script is more reliable than server-side script


data logic table
i would advice to switch to server-side processing of table data instead of using client-side it is more preferable if your application works with a lot of rows more than several hundreds

i think the best way would be for you to write some clustering logic on the server-side and leave the client-side to deal with fewer data points


validation user responsive
server-side validation is more secure than the client-side as the user cannot see the code even he does a view-source

at this point i m putting off worrying about client-side validation since server-side is more important

client-side validation is more responsive to the user but always back it up with proper server-side checks

how you handle things server-side is far more critical than client-side validation which can and will be ignored by malicious users


cocos2d-x	sprite-kit---------------------------------------------------

others
now started porting game from cocos2d-x to sprite-kit as cocos2d-x not offers box2d physics and new version of cocos2d-x 3.0 has less features


simulation	sampling---------------------------------------------------

others
by decoupling simulation from rendering you can render at a higher frequency than your simulation does for sampling


grafana	kibana---------------------------------------------------

others
if you would like a unified front-end for elasticsearch and opentsdb you could consider grafana which has support for both elasticsearch and opentsdb but less functionality than kibana in regard to elasticsearch

grafana is more of visualization only while kibana is for searching the logs is that right

kibana focuses more on logs and adhoc search while grafana focuses more on creating dashboards for visualizing time series data


svg	vml---------------------------------------------------

others
classes in svg aren t quite the same as classes in everything else - and in raphael which deals with svg and ie s vml things get even more hairy

ie s vml is slower than other browser s svg


fileoutputstream	filewriter---------------------------------------------------

others
usually better than filewriter already suggested is to use fileoutputstream which also like filewriter has an append parameter in one of its constructors and which unlike filewriter does not silently assume the default charset encoding slightly bad practice imo

you need to create a fileoutputstream and decorates it with printstream or better filewriter with printwriter


zoo	xts---------------------------------------------------

others
xts extends this further but zoo is a better starting point

however there are many others ts xts which is generally faster than zoo .


nullreferenceexception	argumentnullexception---------------------------------------------------

others
.net makes this better by separating nullreferenceexception you dereferenced a null value from argumentnullexception you shouldn t have passed in null as an argument - and it was for this parameter


rijndael	twofish---------------------------------------------------

others
twofish was much more scrutinized than blowfish so even for symmetric encryption you should not use blowfish but twofish or better yet use the aes aka rijndael which was preferred over twofish


nfa	dfa---------------------------------------------------

others
dfa is a better choice over nfa because it has only one transition for an input while nfa can have many

the net effect is that the backtracking implementations i like that name better than traditional nfa are slightly more expressive than dfa implementations because they can match regexes like which matches three or more word characters repeated twice something that can t be matched by a dfa

if it can be practically determinized this give you a dfa that can be exponentially larger than the nfa then by all means do that

an information represented by a single state in dfa can be represented by a combination of nfa states hence number of states in nfa are less than their equivalent dfa

in fact because you are eliminating the redundancy of epsilon transitions many simple dfa s actually get smaller than the nfa they represent but there is simply no way to guarantee that


regex powerful faster
perl uses nfa which is slower yet more powerful than the dfa engine sed has

regex is a nfa and is as such in most cases slower than a dfa or hand-written parser

generally speaking dfa is faster but nfa is more compact


easier string equivalent
because representation of a given problem with a nfa is far easier than the equivalent dfa

nfa representations are more compact but dfa s are easier to simulate

i know that dfa s are easier to implement than nfa s and that nfa s are slower to arrive at the accept state than dfa s but are there any other explicit well known advantages disadvantages

though forming the nfa maybe easier on paper checking a valid string against an nfa will be more complicated than verifying one against a dfa due to accounting for epsilon-jumps

stephen string search or a compiled dfa you can construct them from an nfa which is easier to make


states thing multiple
only thing is that nfa have more nodes than a dfa

with a dfa you spend more time building it and allocating more states whereas with an nfa you spend more time executing it since it can be multiple states at the same time and backtracking can eat your lunch â and your cpu

if we express combinations of states in an nfa as states themselves we ve got a dfa with a lot more states than the nfa but which does the same thing


monodevelop	sharpdevelop---------------------------------------------------

others
i like the monodevelop ide even better than sharpdevelop but i m not sold on installing and using mono s compiler just yet nor do i know if it can even handle the latest vb.net c# language features

monodevelop is more of a replacement of an ide for mac and linux in windows the recommended thing is to use visual studio or sharpdevelop


jlabel	jeditorpane---------------------------------------------------

others
however if i put a jeditorpane below this and have it span the length of the whole window the jlabel becomes larger and grows if i enlarge the window


jpql	hql---------------------------------------------------

others
there are not much difference apart from hql knowing more stuff than jpql or exotic feature


jqpl works superset
because hql is more or less superset of jpql it of course works also in hql

one way to query those is following jqpl hql being more or less superset of jpql


mapply	do.call---------------------------------------------------

others
if for some strange reason you can do the obvious do.call would be more efficient than mapply

i don t quite understand why you don t want to use mapply but do.call is probably better anyway


division	exponent---------------------------------------------------

subtraction powers expensive
note that the exponent operator has a higher precedence than multiplication and division just like in mathematics

it will be much slower i don t have benchmarks but i would guess at least an order of magnitude maybe more decimal will not benefit from any hardware acceleration and arithmetic on it will require relatively expensive multiplication division by powers of 10 which is far more expensive than multiplication and dividion by powers of 2 to match the exponent before addition subtraction and to bring the exponent back into range after multiplication division


others

getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid---------------------------------------------------

others
it would be slightly more sensible to bind the click to an element closer to the form and if you use getelementbyid rather than getelementsbytagname it s more simple since you don t have to worry about the index of the number you re binding to

getelementsbytagname is slightly different from getelementbyid as getelementbyid will only return one element if it exists whereas getelementsbytagname can return more than one element


spweb	spsite---------------------------------------------------

others
since spsite takes a longer url you may also be able to open the right spweb as well using site.openweb


shiny	rcharts---------------------------------------------------

others
possibly part of the reason of my problems is that the original code from ramnath uses rmaps while i m using rcharts also developed by ramnath as it is more developed better integrated with shiny and of course includes leaflet


gmail	hotmail---------------------------------------------------

others
i know for a fact hotmail is using a rules based spam filter which is quite strict and gmail uses more like a self-learning system which could explain why gmail accepts your message and hotmail doesn t

in outlook.com hotmail it looks closer to the results shown with gmail


highcharts	flotr---------------------------------------------------

others
you should be able to do this in flotr which has a better license than highcharts by just throwing what they showed in this blog post on its side


filesystems	hfs---------------------------------------------------

others
hfs+ supports much larger files than hfs block addresses are 32-bit length instead of 16-bit and uses unicode utf-16 encoding to name files folders and other filesystems objects


maven-shade-plugin	pom.xml---------------------------------------------------

others
this is a lot more pom.xml code but i like it better than the maven-shade-plugin because it does just what i want and nothing more


clang	icc---------------------------------------------------

looser better versions
with gcc and clang your sse code is better whereas icc is a looser

should i suppose that the lengthy simd versions emitted by clang gcc with -o3 icc should run faster than the above one emitted by gcc with -o2


others

cpu	processors---------------------------------------------------

different mode contention
given that you re seeing extra tasks causing a slowdown you likely either have resource contention via locking or your tasks are cpu bound and having more tasks than processors cores will cause slowdowns

real mode seem to be different from cpu to cpu maybe latest processors provide more functions to this mode

the application has far fewer threads than the cpu has processors cores

since downloading web pages is network bound rather than cpu bound using more threads than my number of processors cores is very benificial since most of the time in each thread is spent waiting for the network to catch up

if that processors has more than one cpu can the interrupts run on different cpu cores at the same time

binding threads to cores prevents the operating system from moving around threads between different processors cores which speeds up the executing especially on numa systems machines with more than one cpu sockets and separate memory controller in each socket where data locality is very important


others
on a relatively modern cpu this will also cause the processors to enter a lower power state and should have noticeable effect power usage and the noise generated by the cpu fan

one addition for embedded cpu architecture they have to be usually cheaper than mainstream processors so that they do not raise the product s life considerably

not only is it more expensive in terms of developer costs designing a cpu is vastly more difficult than writing user-space assembly code but it would increase the transistor count of the processors

rise cpu frequency set more powerful processors s

however cpu cycles aren t a great way to measure performance with modern processors which run more than one instruction at once pipelining have multiple layers of cache etc

some fancy compilers understand the un interrelatedness of instructions to a limited extent and will automatically interleave instruction flows probably over a longer window than the cpu sees to better utilise the processors

i would like to use more than one cpu to run ubuntu 14.04 32-bit in virtualbox but when i stop the machine and go in settings - system - processors the processors s slider is grayed out as you can see in the screenshot image

for if your solving algorithm size is greater than the processors cache size the cpu must retrieve pieces of code from main memory or l2 cache which is a slower operation

since registers are closest to the heart of the cpu a.k.a the brain of your processors they are higher up in the chain and ofcourse operations performed directly on registers take the least amount of clock cycles

notice also the the cpu cache is much more important than processors registers today

so whether or not method 5 or 6 is faster depends on the cpu i can only surmise this is because the branch prediction in the command processors of the cpu is smarter on the new processors but i m not really sure

i find using system monitor that consistently 100 of one cpu is used when i run the program directly in terminal whereas when i run it in bash in a loop a maximum of 60 of cpu usage is recorded and seems to be linked to the longer completion time although the average cpu usage is higher over the 4 processors

passive loadbalancing if a physical cpu is running more than one task the scheduler will attempt to run any new tasks on a second physical processors

now the x86 family of processors go back a long way to the 1970s when cpu architecture was simpler

if the processors is loaded enough then my thread works fine but when the processors is more or less free i rich quickly my cpu limitation 50 and finally the pool terminates and needs to be recycled

how would i make python use only 7 of the processors to free up more cpu

if a task is cpu bound calcuating something making it multi threaded will only improve performance if you have more than one processors to run the calculations

the lock or on the first case makes sure that the data has been updated before any other cpu can read any more memory in the second case the xchg instruction has an implicit lock so all other processors cores will have to release their value of ptr before your processors can update the value

to the operating system a single thread which i assume is what you mean by java process essentially cannot use cpu on more than one processors which may or may not mean a physical core-- see below simultaneously

yes i know that browsers can take advantage of it and that putting the other stuff on the other processors can provide more cpu power to the javascript thread but i have an app that is mostly raw javscript internal processing where the main thing that is going on is search and array manipulation

that is enable to your program to use more at least than one thread more than one processors if necessary that is by definition capped at 1 single virtual core of full use thus 100 of cpu that you see on top on linux or equivalent in other system

because the time taken to migrate a cpu or a cluster is shorter than the dvfs change time and an order of magnitude shorter than the os evaluation period for dvfs changes big.little transitions will enable the processors to run at lower operating points more frequently and further be completely invisible to the user

is opencl just there to make multi processors cores just more portable meaning porting the code to either gpu or cpu or is opencl faster and more efficient

i have created a window application in c#.now i want to set the cpu affinity for this application.i may have 2 processors 4 processors 8 processors or may be more than 8 processors

cpu speeds matter less than they did in the past thanks to the advent of multi-core processors

cannot sleep run atomically in soft irq context and are guaranteed to never run on more than one cpu of a given processors for a given tasklet

if it needs to be more specific with processors and stuff let s just say this is for raspberry pi 2a 900mhz quad-core arm cortex-a7 cpu on the latest raspian os

many current processors chips incorporate more than one cpu and a cpu may itself be able to interleave a couple of threads

vcpu reg are virtual cpu registers that exist on many processors that have things like multiple cores hyperthreading or other features that enable higher layers to believe that there is more than one cpu present when there isn t -- such as today s x86s

and in fact modern processors often have a built-in virtualization feature which even allows virtualization software such as virtualbox or vmware to run the instructions natively while the virtual part is done by the cpu itself allowing much faster execution speed of virtual machines.

newer processors have other faster ways to do it and which ones are available depends on whether the cpu is from amd or intel and on the specific cpu model

on a better machine 8 x intel r xeon r cpu e5-4610 v2 2.30ghz 256 gb ram much to my surprise i obtained an average 3 milions increments despite the fact that processors is much better

elapsed time is generally higher than cpu time with the exception of a multi processors environment


system resources execution
on a system with more than one processors or processors cores you can normally assuming you do have a smp-enabled system cpu affinity doesn t prevent it expect those two processes to use both processors but you do not strictly have a guarantee

as soon as you go beyond single processors it s much more effective to add another cpu or two to system than to struggle with gpu calculations

with current hardware at about twice the number of active threads as execution units cores ht logical processors however the architecture handles multithreaded execution your cpu starts spending more time scheduling thread execution and managing thread states than it is actually executing the threaded instructions

the operating system will give your program all the resources it needs the reason your process is not consuming all the cpu is probably because it s waiting for the io sub system more than the processors

the difference you notice is very small but i think the multi-thread processors is spending more time because the concurrency for the cpu resources between the threads


memory data ram
the point of this cache is to store data that the cpu is using quite regularly to speed up transfer time since the cpu cache is physically closer to the processors then ram is

having data structures that start on 4 byte word alignment on cpus with 4 byte buses and processors is far more efficient when moving data around memory and between ram and the cpu

this is because some compilers or processors will use more bits of precision in a cpu register than in memory msvc has 3 different floating-point behavior options for example


core computer intel
the intel amd processors are much cheaper and faster than what you can get with these until they go in every cpu everywhere

in general when used on single processors single core machine this should be sufficient assuming int size same or smaller than cpu word like 32bit int on 32bit cpu

i have read a superscalar cpu architecture implements a form of parallelism called instruction level parallelism within a single processors superscalar cant use more than one processors

processors intel core i3-2120 cpu 3.30ghz 4 cpus

multicore refers to a computer or processors that has more than one logical cpu core and that can execute multiple instructions at the same time.

for complicated reasons having to do with the internal electronics of the cpu for most modern processors it is faster to perform a direct branch where the destination address is encoded in the instruction than an indirect branch where the address is computed at runtime

windows 7 home premium service pack 1 processors intel core i5-2410m cpu 2.30 ghz 2.30ghz

the rule of thumb is that if a cpu is given more than double the count of actively running threads as it has execution units these are the physical cores on a cpu chip and logical processors like hyperthreading technology that splits one core into two then the os will spend more time scheduling threads and switching between them cache-thrashing than it will spend actually running the threads

multicore means that a single cpu can have more than one core capable of executing tasks and has all execution units connected in some way depending on the architecture of the processors

i have a quad core processors and the threadpoolexecutor is set to 4 core threads but when i submit my callables hundred or so to the threadpoolexecutor java never uses more than 25 cpu

should i just look for more than one cpu core and how do i detect that or maybe the processors speed or total system memory

i have read that the number of threads cannot be more than the number of logical processors your computer has or at least there is no advantage to be gained since your cpu cannot handle more

since these are typically orders of magnitude slower than the processors from the cpu s perspective this takes forever

processors intel core i5-2500k cpu 3.30ghz sandy bridge processorcount 4

processors intel core i7-4790 cpu 3.60ghz x 8

processors intel core i5-5300u cpu 2.30ghz 2.30ghz

processors intel core i7-4770hq cpu 2.20ghz haswell processorcount 2

a quad core intel cpu s with hyperthreading enabled has 4 physical cores yet 8 logical processors hyperthreading creates 4 more logical processors

processors intel core i5-4440 cpu 3.10ghz x 4

multicore refers to a computer or processors that has more than one logical cpu core and that can physically execute multiple instructions at the same time

processors intel core i7-6700hq cpu 2.60ghz

processors intel core i7-3930k cpu 3.20ghz

processors intel core i5-4440 cpu 3.10ghz that s to mention if speed matters

the cpu is indeed slower on sparc 1.2ghz and as answered by one of the sun s engineers t2 is usualy 3 times slower for single-threaded application than modern intel processors

processors intel core i3-4005u cpu 1.70ghz 1.70ghz


control-structure	break---------------------------------------------------

others
e.g. break with labels as in java or even a more generic goto. continue does not seem more special than other control-structure mechanisms except that it is present in more languages


bitblt	direct2d---------------------------------------------------

others
the thing is that gdi is still faster than direct2d if i draw to a bitmap and after it s done i bitblt the result back to the form it paints at 35ms and with the same graphics quality


primes	palindrome---------------------------------------------------

others
calculating primes takes more iteration than checking for a palindrome

any algorithm that is based on generating primes then testing for a palindrome will be much slower that generating palindrome and then testing for primes

palindrome are a sparser set of numbers than primes and you can generate palindrome directly

i m trying to create a program that outputs the highest primes than is a palindrome and is less than 1000


selecteditem	selectedindex---------------------------------------------------

others
i ve found that setting the selecteditem is more reliable than setting the selectedindex


icomparable	compareto---------------------------------------------------

others
icomparable declares the compareto method which returns an integer that specifies a less than equals to or greater than relationship between two objects of the same type

implementing icomparable is a more fine-grain way of comparison as it provides the compareto method which is a greater-than less-than comparison as opposed to equals which is simply a is-equal-or-not comparison


median	rank---------------------------------------------------

others
this step works because all elements less than the median in a would intersect only with those elements before the insertion rank of a s median in b

we use ave to see which rank are greater than the median for each group and we select where those are true


onchange	onkeyup---------------------------------------------------

others
you might want to use onchange instead of onkeyup to make it less hyperactive

using onkeyup or oninput suggest by mohamedrias rather than onchange event is more suitable in your case

also onchange won t work you ll need to use onkeyup although onblur is probably more sane


html5lib	elementtree---------------------------------------------------

others
if for some reason you want to use an implementation that does not give you a full parse tree then i would suggest parsing the resulting html using lxml a python wrapper of the c lib or html5lib pure python both of which can return an elementtree object and are much faster especially lxml and more forgiving of invalid html especially html5lib which acts more like real browsers in the real world


ng-app	ng-controller---------------------------------------------------

others
a ng-app can have more than 1 ng-controller


acs	adfs---------------------------------------------------

others
adfs has more powerful claims transformation capabilities than acs

you can however use adfs in chain with acs to inject more claims

it seems possible to have adfs as the ip-sts send an assertion to more than 1 acs url based upon the acs url or acs index in the authnrequest as long as they are listed in the relaying party trust endpoints list


class-method	delegation---------------------------------------------------

others
however often it s better to delegation use cases like these to other class-method which are more explicit about what they do for example foo.relating_to bar


tidyverse	plyr---------------------------------------------------

others
plyr is an older version of dplyr so i would use the newer one especially because it come in the tidyverse group


hmisc	stargazer---------------------------------------------------

others
stargazer is at least in my experience more general than latex from hmisc


devise	cancan---------------------------------------------------

others
devise is mostly used for authentication but cancan is better to deal with user privileges


caliburn.micro	prism---------------------------------------------------

others
imho any modern mvvm-framework like catel caliburn.micro mvvmlight reactiveui is much better than prism


automake	autotools---------------------------------------------------

others
in the case of autotools it is slightly more complicated because not everybody who compiles the software would need automake and autoconf installed only those that need to change the build system adding new files counts as changing the build system


vundle	pathogen---------------------------------------------------

others
also i tried installing pathogen and that worked for some bundles but would not work for perlomni.vim because it was an ftplugin and pathogen was not appending the bundles correctly and after research i saw most people saying vundle was better than pathogen


amr	aac---------------------------------------------------

others
mp3 or aac compression format is suited for music content and amr is better suited for speech content


qevent	qobject---------------------------------------------------

others
posting qevents to qobject is faster than using signal-slot invocations because there are no copy constructors called and there s no marshalling done except directly by you upon construction of a qevent


sticky	affix---------------------------------------------------

others
so instead of playing with the bootstrap affix it was easier to create a custom sticky navigation


inherited	subclassing---------------------------------------------------

others
for classes in an inherited tree that defines __slots__ subclassing will have a __dict__ unless they

this breaks the inherited and the subclassing is no longer an instance of the superclass

since simplefactory is not final you can definitely subclassing it gaining more flexibility than with a factory method because simplefactory replaces inherited with composition

if you are going for an inherited approach you should keep in mind that subclassing should be more specialized than their respective superclass

if you are dealing with large numbers of subclassing instances prototypical inherited may serve you better

there is one careful gotcha if you add an overload to ifoo of a method not an override an overload the order of the virtual methods changes and if you add a new virtual parent the layout of the virtual table can change and this only works reliably if all inherited to your abstract classes is virtual in your public api with virtual inherited the vtable has pointers to the start of each vtable of the subclassing so each subclassing can have a bigger vtable without messing up the address other functions virtual functions

this example is a bit looser than the inherited model provided by languages such as java -- an animal instance can have any behaviour at all rather than one of a specific set of behaviours depending on its subclassing

with inherited this is less likely to happen due the contractual nature of subclassing abstract classes

but native hibernate support regarding inherited mapping is more powerful than standard jpa and single table per class hierarchy or table per subclassing mapping strategies are more suitable for polymorphic queries and associations than table per concrete class strategy

it s conceptually more sound as subclassing a thread suggests specializing its behaviour while runnable s are more like task containers - favor composition over inherited

with single table inherited one table must have all the attributes that any of the subclassing need more information

although this problem sort of yells delegate it s much easier with subclassing since you intend to inherited almost all the same functionality

it seems like you re a little confused about what a subclassing and by extension inherited symbolizes instead of thinking that a subclassing belongs to its parent class pretend that a subclassing is a more specific version of its parent class

in enhanced er modelling subclassing inheriting from more than 1 superclass is called multiple inherited


class better composition
depending on how your application is structured this means you may want to have your own base class implementing iresource which creates your custom not found resource for all of its subclassing or better make a wrapper since composition is better than inherited

with subclassing is trickier because any private members of a class are not inherited by the subclassing but protected and public are

since ireadwrite implements ireadonly ireadwrite is said to be a subclassing of ireadonly although subclassing is more accurately used to describe a class which inherited a base class rather then implements an interface--for the sake of simplicity they are very nearly the same concept

creating the views with code only i think one is better off with subclassing if it comes to more than one level of inherited or many ancestor classes for just one base view

if i have a bunch of fields in a parent class that all need to be inherited by subclassing is it better to have the subclassing nested in the superclass make the fields protected rather than private or use protected accessor

perhaps the class should be decomposed in other classes or subclassing if in your case inherited is more valuable than composition so every class has a well defined responsibility in the system

if a subclassing needs more information than the standard parameters which came up for us you have the option of a second parameters class type that you use as a second parameter but then you have two types of constructors in the tree or using inherited in the parameters class hierarchy


method data object
inherited is more useful when a new subclassing wants to change the way a method works if you just need to change the data the class uses to work probably an approach like this would do the trick

the tostring method is inherited from object but can be overridden in a subclassing to get more meaningful output


visibility can straight
similarly as the subclassing gains more methods it inherited the list of superclass in the order in which they were named that precede it

i don t see any straight way to restrict subclassing from choosing a wider visibility for inherited members

still you cannot inherited from a as superclass cannot have a lower visibility than subclassing


behavior re-use serious
i generally use interfaces are too enforce a common behavior that a group of classes share whereas subclassing is more appropriately used in cases where you can achieve serious code re-use through inherited functions properties

usually i subclassing the stock cocoa classes customize to my needs and if i need custom methods in more than one subclassing i will declare a category on the superclass rather than relying on inherited to provide my custom behavior


nsbuttoncell	nsmatrix---------------------------------------------------

others
building a reverse column order solution as recommended for nstable here for the nsmatrix require some more work since i use a single column nsmatrix with nsbuttoncell


dojo	dwr---------------------------------------------------

others
they merged with dojo which in my opinion is a better choice than dwr


win64	windows---------------------------------------------------

others
although if your api can be used on multiple operating systems then win64 may be better assuming that its only intended to be used for windows and there s an equivalent for the other os


consistency	acid---------------------------------------------------

others
newer nosql systems are trying to focus on availability while traditional acid databases had a higher focus on consistency

using a database system such as sqlite or mysql that follows the acid principles is much more easy as the database system guarantees consistency atomicity of the transactions isolation and durability

however the isolation part of acid sounds more like consistency model in particular the sequential consistency model


fontconfig	freetype---------------------------------------------------

others
we updated freetype in osx 10.6.5 and fontconfig which links against freetype wants this newer version


bigloo	ecl---------------------------------------------------

others
this one is more for bigloo - is it more functional than ecl


boyer-moore	knuth-morris-pratt---------------------------------------------------

others
knuth-morris-pratt which is classic or boyer-moore which is sometimes faster


inherited	properties---------------------------------------------------

methods execution clear
inherited can be more about invoking properties and methods in an execution context similar to how we use .call or .apply and doesn t need to beget a massive codebase full of modules extending other modules only to end up treating them like completely isolated and individual objects anyway

using dedicated methods for getting and setting properties is also more clear in inherited


higher prototype tree
i don t see any form properties in the code you posted so either the posted code has been modified or the properties is higher in the inherited tree simpleformcontroller

in essence an object inherited all properties of its prototype but an object s own properties has higher precedence than those of its prototype


others
even if there are no inherited enumerable properties it is still more work to do than not

extension or task properties might be easier to isolate since they re not inherited but they re less ad hoc

the inherited and overriding of properties properties calls worked fine earlier

for the vm layer i like the containment pattern more than inherited and at this layer i also implement inotifypropertychanged which is also a properties of the vm and not the data model

if you were planning on doing this for more than one properties i d recommend making car inherited from dependencyobject or implementing it from inotifypropertychanged instead of creating events for each

counter1 can be used with instanceof and inherited but is more verbose and doesn t have real private properties eg count properties is exposed

you could also use the tag properties for this pourpose but i think that inherited will be more clear adding semantic meaning to your code

if i m reading your situation right it sounds like you d be better served by avoiding inherited on thing and instead thing about category-specific attributes as properties of the relation between things and categories

however i could not find it the documentation so it may inherited more than properties

not all properties are inherited read more here

now in .net for desktop controls you can use inherited which is much more powerful than the old tag properties anyway

just inherited from the keynotfoundexception class and override the message properties to generate a more meaningful message and then use your own exception class with a proper constructor

multiple inherited makes it easier to compose classes from small mixin base classes that implement functionality and have properties to remember state

i generally use interfaces are too enforce a common behavior that a group of classes share whereas subclassing is more appropriately used in cases where you can achieve serious code re-use through inherited functions properties

inherited is more of an is-a relationship for example a usermodel is-a model thus all properties and methods of a model will be part of a usermodel

use rgba instead on the container div to set the opacity as the opacity properties is inherited by all children elements even text nodes meaning a descendant of any kind can t have a higher opacity than its parent

this should handle all cases of setting the properties makes them easier to implement in your inherited classes and cleans things up

i fully understand that the properties are more easily accessed as public and that normally inherited objects won t have access to them otherwise

so i doubt the line-height properties is getting inherited to your .title from its parent so just check from where it is getting inherited and set the higher value for it


better values composition
you cannot do that on that way but you can access a properties s setter method from a derived class so you can use inherited for the purpose

potentially you are trying to model something in inherited that is better suited for composition or your base class should be taking in an object instead of individual related properties if the properties aren t related then perhaps your base class is doing too much single responsibility principle

less is a css extension that enables reuse and encapsulation of values color values for instance improves inherited allows a better nesting of related properties and operations also

since the paddle object has properties that are shared by both player and enemy composition is a better choice than inherited

the textfield abstract class which singlelinetextfield inherited from defines a tostring method but also value and values properties which are much better suited to what you re trying to do


models flexibility variable
this allows me to keep all of my models from having to inherited from a base class that has a messages properties and gives me more flexibility

if you need a globally accessible variable or properties that s more suited to a base class that your classes inherited from


mockito	jmockit---------------------------------------------------

others
mockito s a much older library than jmockit so you could expect that it would have many more features

comparison between mockito vs jmockit - why is mockito voted better than jmockit


x86	64bit---------------------------------------------------

others
to me the path without x86 is also more visually appealing and indicates that it s a modern application - adapted for 64bit operation where necessary

x86 doesn t support higher precision than 80 bits but if you really need more than 64bit for a fp algorithm most likely you should check your numerics instead of solving the problem with brute force

on arm it is not or rather 32-bit os on 64bit uefi is technically possible only would still require the operating system loader to be 64bit but even fiddlier than on x86

amd64 64bit cpus have larger registers and more of them compared with x86 32 bit cpus

the difference is in the first number which shows the rounding of the intermediate calculation so the problem happens because x86 has a higher internal precision 80 bit than the arm 64bit

x86 allows easier debugging - edit and continue is not supported when running in 64bit mode

register spilling is pretty cheap on x86 cpus due to fast l1 caches and register shadowing and other tricks and the 64bit only registers are more costly to access in terms of larger instructions so it may just be that gcc s version is as fast or faster than the one you want

however my tests have shown that on a 64bit system an anycpu prefer 32-bit application which i confirm runs 32-bit can allocate more memory than an x86 one

reason why double can t be declared volatile it s 64bit which makes it more than the word size on x86 which prevents it from being declared volatile in the cli if i remember correctly

x86 is considerably slower a few clocks plus a clock or so per function argument while 64bit is much less because most function arguments are passed in registers instead of on the stack

in addition x86 is furhter complicated because there are generally separate documentation manuals for 32 bit and 64bit processors i m not familiar enough with arm to comment here

no intel or amd x86 manuals ever guarantee atomicity of anything wider than 64bit except for lock cmpxchg16b so this talk of sse vector loads stores being atomic on some cpus isn t something that you can reliably take advantage of or detect when it s supported

although maybe you should instead find some 32 64bit recent book for your os as the 32b protected mode on x86 is much easier to learn only the graphics output is not as straightforward as it was back in dos era but if you will mix your asm files with c++ loader which would for example initialize some window surface as argb memory array you can pass that pointer down to the asm routines and toy around with pixels in the same simple way how the old 320x200 mode 13h in dos worked

a 64bit capable x86 cpu is no worse at running 32-bit code


32-bit x86_64 machines
64bit amd and later intel machines run faster than 32-bit x86 machines because when amd designed the new instruction set they added more cpu registers and made sse math the default

in fact for x86 64 processors performing 32-bit or 16-bit operations are less efficient than 64bit or 8-bit operations due to the operand prefix byte that has to be decoded

for other types of programs though 64bit can be faster than 32-bit at least on x86 x64

the x86_64 64bit platform is much more than twice the width of the x86 32-bit


better performances luck
however if you don t have specific reasons to use anycpu then you could still use x86 because in some cases the performances are better than 64bit code

i had better luck with the x86 one than the 64bit version in win 7


slower 32bits faster
faster than on x86 32bits but slower than x64 64bit

64bit code is not actually faster it is usually a bit slower than x86 code


onresume	onpause---------------------------------------------------

others
and you should not access vehicledataprovider before onresume in the life cylcle and no more after onpause


httpconnection	downloading---------------------------------------------------

others
since the buffer size of inputstream depends on the byte size i assigned when i use httpconnection the downloading speed is faster since it spends less time at writing the buffer data to file


keystore	jks---------------------------------------------------

others
instead you can support more than the jks and try the default keystore type and if it fails try the #pkcs12

in this default implementation the jks format is better suited for a single keystore that is to handle both trusted entries and key entries in the same container

i believe the storage formats were either jks the standard java keystore jceks a java keystore that provides much stronger protection of private keys or pkcs12


jython	pypy---------------------------------------------------

others

faster recent benchmark
jython is more unpredictableâ sometimes almost as fast as pypy sometimes much slower than cpython

here is a recent benchmark of jython 2.5.2 running on jvm 7 where jython is slower than pypy but faster than cpython


dbcontext	objectcontext---------------------------------------------------

common simpler development
and dbcontext is much simpler to use than objectcontext and will serve the most common development needs

dbcontext is much simpler to use than objectcontext and will serve the most common development needs


others
when it comes to deletion it even gets worse when saving at the end of all entity removals dbcontext is around 18 times slower than objectcontext

you just need to connect using the entity framework driver and if you develop in any of technologies that uses dbcontext includes code first model first and data base first but is lighter than objectcontext you can use the list below

i used to use dbcontext for all of my db models until i read ways to optimize entity framework after following the steps i found my self forced to switch to objectcontext instead so there were alot of code changes to be done but i am not sure that i doing the right thing specially after googling the deference i ve noticed that dbcontext is newer and better than objectcontext and also i noticed that i lost alot of things while switching to objectcontext like migrations and find method and much more.

you can try to convert dbcontext to objectcontext and use the more complex api

in 6.7 a graph it shown that states that the performance of a objectcontext linq query is better than dbcontext linq query

the description is related to objectcontext api but dbcontext api is just wrapper suffering same issues actually dbcontext api suffers even more issues in this scenario and because of that i will skip solution with manually setting relationships

the problem is that to do so you need to use objectcontext instead of dbcontext which makes things harder

you must either include foreign keys to your entities so they will be tracked as normal values or you must convert your dbcontext to objectcontext and use more powerful and more cumbersome objectstatemanager where you can get instances of objectstateentry for both entities and relations

ok - it appears that the objectcontext can translate from system.data.sqlclient.sqldatareader meaning i don t need to derive directly from the dbcontext

from what i have read the dbcontext is a simplified version of the objectcontext and makes it easier to work with

assuming that what i see that is missing in your code is for you to pass the new instance of databindingprojection to your dbcontext if using 4.2+ or to the objectcontext if using older versions i would recommend migrating to 5.0

if adding 2000 entities and saving the changes at the end dbcontext is 3 to 5 times slower than objectcontext btw. i know that adding a large amount of entities would be better using sqlbulkcopy but that s not the point


former offer powerful
there are many reasons why the dbcontext api is better than the older objectcontext api but in your case it may initially feel like a downgrade

dbcontext is a much more pleasant api than objectcontext

my understanding is that although dbcontext is newer it s not necessarily better than objectcontext it just provides a different api that might be considered simpler but doesn t that depend on the use case

besides the dbcontext api is easier to use than objectcontext

dbcontext is newer api which should polish developers experience when using most common tasks - simply the api is better designed but you still have to get objectcontext from dbcontext and use the older api if you want to use some more complex features

it is a feature it is about objectcontext api but the same is true or worse with dbcontext api

the problem with dbcontext api is even worse because dbcontext api doesn t offer methods to change state of independent association so you must revert back to objectcontext api and use objectstatemanager.changerelationshipstate

dbcontext api is easier to work with than objectcontext but both approaches use the former

entity sql which is not available in code first and dbcontext api - you must access it through objectcontext api is more powerful because it is not dependent on limited functionality offered by linq


web-inf	facesservlet---------------------------------------------------

others
this example will move the resources folder into web-inf hereby ensuring more security it is now not possible anymore to access those resources independently from the facesservlet


csv	tsv---------------------------------------------------

others
it seems you could use tsv instead of csv to produce easier to visualise columns separated by tab

be careful with writing as csv because your second column now has comma in it so tsv may be better

tsv tab separated values so the built-in csv module is more than enough to export your data

also your csv looks more like a tsv tab separated instead of comma separated

i think that generally csv are supported more often than the tsv format


tesseract	leptonica---------------------------------------------------

others
but tesseract based on leptonica uses older versions of these libraries which have incompatible parameters


xsl-fo	xslt---------------------------------------------------

others
xslt + xsl-fo are then easier to handle imo

all in all t4 to me is more of a inside vs code-generation tool to quickly create c# or other files while xslt is more of a data-processing data-transformation tool to turn data from xml into another format typically html or pdf using xsl-fo


wideimage	phpthumb---------------------------------------------------

others
wideimage is the more modern php5 approach while phpthumb has much more features


lwp	libwww-perl---------------------------------------------------

others
you could use libwww-perl perldoc lwp and have more control about the download process


screens	mdpi---------------------------------------------------

good 72x72 resolution
do note that a 120x120px image if displayed on the screens will be 3x smaller on a xxhdpi device compared to a mdpi device as there are three times as many pixels per inch

if you re diligent about making graphics for at least the main three densities ldpi mdpi and hdpi then you should not see over-large icons except where the screens is physically smaller than your layout expects it

a ldpi image on a hdpi screens would appear smaller than the same image on a mdpi or ldpi screens

addressing issue #2 if your mdpi phone has a smaller screens than 600dp it will use the layout in res layout folder

i don t know how many screens today are still ldpi and mdpi but i want to support smaller screens while still looking good on large screens even large screens that are lower density

try placing youre images in res mdpi they will be streched to fit screens which are bigger hdpi xhdpi

ldpi assets will look bad on high density screens but are exponentially smaller than mdpi which is exponentially smaller than hdpi etc

a hdpi image on a ldpi screens would appear larger than the same image on a mdpi or hdpi screens

i have used this link to generate nine-patch images however even if i add the files to the drawable ldpi mdpi ldpi xhdpi and xxhdpi folders the image is still shorter than the screens width

so as i said - mdpi also doesn t means that your screens resolution is less than hdpi screens resolution

if the screens density is less than xhdpi i load smaller sampled sizes of the 96x96 image - as 36x36 for ldpi 48x48 for mdpi 72x72 for hdpi

even if i create three versions for ldpi mdpi and hdpi there are more than screens resolutions in that table if there is no matching image it will scale my image and may not retain the aspect ratio


others
so a g1 will show mdpi bitmaps slightly smaller than a mdpi device with a true 160dpi screens but this is a very small difference so it s not a big deal

in my android app i have a background image which is longer than the screens width for all the three types of screens.this implies that i have got 3 drawables each for different screens type mdpi ldpi hdpi and hence i have included a horizontal scroll bar in my app

i read in some tutorials that android automatically scales up the images when the screens resolution is bigger than mdpi

in other words the if these were real phones the mdpi would have a bigger screens allthough both have the same resolution

owing to the fact that the screens density on the tablet is smaller android therefore uses the images in the mdpi folder for the tablet and the slightly bigger ones in the hdpi folder for the phone

if device screens destiny is more than mdpi - use default values folder

the reason those two really high resolutions exist in mdpi is because they are only used on tablet which have a larger screens size...so the dpi rating works out to still be in the midrange


cpython	pypy---------------------------------------------------

data part structures
when people talk about pypy using less memory than cpython this is a major part of what they re talking about

if the dominant memory usage is program data structures then i wouldn t be at all surprised to find pypy using significantly less memory than cpython whether or not the jit was enabled


faster slower tests
if that isn t sufficient a lot of standard python code can be run on the pypy implementation which generally faster than the cpython implementation

you could try running it in pypy - for some cases it can be significantly faster than cpython

as gnibbler pointed out cpython is slower in the simple implementation but pypy is jit compiled for much faster code when you need it

pypy which in general is much faster than cpython is considerably slower for this use case

in the competing programming a lot of problems are never meant to be solved with cpython but with pypy which has a faster integer-arithmetic and a git-compiler but otherwise a python interpreter just as cpython

so how is it possible for pypy to be faster than cpython also becomes fairly obvious

pypy is supposedly faster than cpython while gevent is based on co-routines and greenlets which supposedly makes for a faster web server

this is why pypy may be slower than cpython sometimes it needs a warm-up phase in which it can actually optimize repeated operations

so at this point in time pypy is just over 9 times faster than cpython in this micro benchmark

pypy compiled with jit is almost always faster than cpython frequently by a large margin

under cpython tests run 4 times faster than under pypy

that site does not claim pypy is 6.3 times faster than cpython

for python there is a pypy project which it includes jit making possible the code to run faster than in cpython in many cases

oh and it can use cpython for its innermost loop or psyco - but pypy is faster than either especially on 32 bit systems

pypy is faster than cpython s sum intrinsic because it can figure out that all the elements of the array are numeric and slice out a bunch of per-element overhead

the pypy jit for python is also much more complex than cpython but also typically much faster â increased complexity is a fairly typical cost for speed. the four levels of disassembly for julia code give you access to the representation of a julia method implementation for particular argument types at different stages of the transformation from source code to machine code

pypy is currently more than 5x faster than cpython on average

i saw that pypy is generally faster than cpython

cpython is faster than pypy on the two tests slowspitfire and waf

the answer is simple here - pickle on pypy is slower because it s implemeneted in pure python as opposed to c in cpython

i haven t tried comparing the two but this pypy bug seems to suggest that multiprocessing in pypy is slower than in cpython

one of the reasons why pypy can be faster than cpython is because pypy is compiled to a completely separate native executable and does not depend on nor execute in cpython

unfortunately as martijn pieters noted there are no accepted solution for python 3.x and only one for python 2.x and according to the amount of memory spent for solving it numerix could have used psyco the library on which pypy is based much faster than cpython

i ve tried using pypy because i ve heard its faster than the cpython interpreter but still no good

just keep in mind most of the time c is faster than python but then again most of the time pypy is faster than cpython

can someone please help to how use that script using the pypy as i heard it is much faster than cpython

pypy s jit can make python code execute much faster than cpython

part of the compiler toolchain includes an experimental jit generator now in its fifth incarnation and starting to work really well - the goal is for a jited pypy to run much faster than cpython

however consider that pypy might do the linear search 100 times faster than cpython then a few times might be dozens

pypy is now faster than cpython in most cases

i presume it s why is pypy faster than cpython some of the time

i finally ran it through pypy and was delighted to discover that when the lists got really deep pypy was running significantly faster than cpython

you might want to try running your trainer under pypy if you aren t already -- it s significantly faster than cpython for some workloads

jython is more unpredictableâ sometimes almost as fast as pypy sometimes much slower than cpython

some people may argue with me on this one but i find pypy to be faster than cpython

note that there are plenty of python implementations other than cpython out there - for loopy code pypy tends to be much faster than cpython

judging from the benchmarks posted on the pypy speed center it appears as if pypy is faster than cpython for all but two of the tests presented

here is a recent benchmark of jython 2.5.2 running on jvm 7 where jython is slower than pypy but faster than cpython


others
long-term evidence is showing that pypy runs certain python codes slower than cpython and this drawback seems to be rooted very deeply in pypy

but for a really useful explanation you d have to tell us exactly which database and library you re using and which python versionâ cpython 3.3.2 s csv module seems to be a lot faster than cpython 2.7.5 s and pypy 2.1 2.7.2 seems to be faster than cpython 2.7.5 as well but then either one also might run your code faster tooâ and so on

cpython runs on more architectures than pypy and has been successfully adapted to run in embedded architectures in ways that may be impractical for pypy

i know many of pypy s data structures are actually smaller than cpython s but again that has nothing to do with the jit

in other words a future cffi release should give an alternative way to do embedding simpler than both cpython s and pypy s custom solutions respectively using the cpython c api and following

edit again one completely different approach would be to use pypy s sandboxing mechanism which should be much more secure than cpython plus a sandboxing module

pypy has a higher recursion limit than cpython normally

profiling is known to slow pypy a lot more than cpython

if pypy succeeds to be better than cpython in general which is questionable the main weakness affecting its wider adoption will be its compatibility with cpython

secondly the current version of pypy consumes much more memory than cpython in a rather large set of cases

now there are some implementations like pypy rpython which run a static-typing phase and should favor much better than cpython here

further the relative speed of profiled code may well differ hugely between them - pypy code is low-level and so introducing profiling is likely to slow it down relatively speaking more than cpython

as mentioned by ifloop this would be running a cpython c extension module on pypy which often works not always but is slower than on cpython

i did a search on the web but i was unable to find any evidence that suggests that pypy s memory usage is much more than cpython


first better answer
pypy particularly benefit more from the second approach while cpython fared better on the first approach

the waf benchmark has less of a pronounced difference in performance and i d guess that the answer would be more complicated some factors pypy does better some factors cpython does better and overall cpython comes out slightly ahead

as you can see the program is much quicker under pypy than cpython which is why i moved to it in the first place but at the cost of a 10-fold increase in memory


avcapturesession	avassetwriter---------------------------------------------------

others
avcapturesession is far more rudimentary compared to avaudiorecorder - it does not provide any recording facilities by itself for example and so if you wanted to also record the audio you would need to use an avassetwriter to save the samples


pow	sqrt---------------------------------------------------

implementation accurate fast
first of all sqrt x should be faster and more accurate than pow x 0.5 why do you think it s in the library

my question is is fast implementation of pow x 0.5f faster than fast sqrt x


others
using sqrt gives the correct answer plus using pow function takes more time

and as tom karzes mentioned sqrt is also better than using pow for calculating square roots


viewdidload	viewwillappear---------------------------------------------------

location view viewdidappear
if you insist on having the location before viewdidload is called viewwillappear would be a better place then you have to hold off pushing that viewcontroller until you have a sufficient location

in your viewdidload on the second view or viewwillappear is probably better set the background image to the image you put in the property

you may find using viewdidload rather than viewwillappear or viewdidappear may work better in this case you can set your view up with a loading holding graphic or animation trigger your asynchronous networking call and then once complete display the required information

important note placing these calls in viewwillappear and viewwilldisappear instead of viewdidload makes this easier to handle as it will work reliably even for multiple pushes and pops of the same view controller and you won t have to clean up after it in the previous view controller

which describes using viewwillappear method instead of viewdidload called earlier and incorrect values for bounds

i d nevertheless suggest you register as observer in viewwillappear and unregister in viewwilldisappear since viewdidunload is called only when memory has to be freed meaning viewdidload get called much more often than viewdidunload and then you might have the problem of getting the same notification more than once

yes you can query it in viewdidload but if you do it in viewwillappear will be more good because viewdidload calls once when view loading first time and never called again until unless view will deloc but viewwillappear call every time for example you have one view and it have navigation view inside and you navigate inside the other view so when you press back button viewdidload will not call but yes viewwillappear will always call


velocity	rythm---------------------------------------------------

high pure page
the benchmark shows rythm is 2 to 3 times faster than velocity on a normal page

rythm is a strong typed java template engine using razor like syntax with high performance 2 to 3 times faster than velocity and fm

rythm is a high performance 2 to 3 times faster than velocity pure java template which use razor like syntax


others
probably you can take a look at rythm template engine which is much faster than freemarker and velocity also much easier to use


qscrollarea	qwidget---------------------------------------------------

others
when i expand the widgets on the left pane by clicking on the controls and the height of the qwidget of the qscrollarea is bigger than then height of the qscrollarea itself the scrollbar appears as expected but it s overlapping the content of the qscrollarea


textmate	gedit---------------------------------------------------

others
i tried a few ides on ubuntu and it just didn t seem right - gedit is lightweight and i actually enjoy using it more than textmate on os x


mousemove	mouseleave---------------------------------------------------

others
take a look at mouseenter and mouseleave events they are better than mousemove and mouseenter combinations


allocator	stl---------------------------------------------------

others
i ve tried it with std map and found the seems to be faster indeed but my question is how can be the stl implementation be so slower than a specific allocator and what are the drawbacks of another allocator than the standard in terms of both portability and robustness

since the author of the specialized memory allocator has more knowledge on the size of the objects allocated from the pool and how those allocator occur the allocator can use the memory more efficiently than a general purpose allocator such as the one provided by the stl


jlist	jtable---------------------------------------------------

example tablecelleditor rendering
i think jtable would be better jcomponents as jlist because there you can implements tablecelleditor maybe example with similair output here

i don t really think that jtable will help you here anyhow better than jlist - it has the same rendering strategy


display better
probably using a jlist or a jtable is a better choice than display records using text fields

a jlist would probably be better than a jtable


others
it seems like you only need one column of commandeditors so jlist would ve been easier to use had it support cell editor like jtable does

should i go further and make a custom jtable class of sorts and jlist can have a bigger panel size but they are only painted and not intractable


icarousel	uicollectionview---------------------------------------------------

others
my only problem is that is seems that using uicollectionview is a better approach and i have read some seemingly off-hand comments about icarousel being a poor approach


quicksort	timsort---------------------------------------------------

others
i ve read that timsort is better than quicksort both in the best and the worst case although it uses a bit more memory

you can take a look at timsort which for non completely random data performs better than quicksort they have the same asymptotic complexity but timsort has lower constants

if it is true then timsort will always take less comparison than quicksort because on real life data there is some pattern except data is truly random

this means that while the two underlying sorts it uses mergesort and insertion sort are both worse than quicksort for many kinds of data timsort only uses them when it is advantageous to do so

java s array .sort is from about java 6 actually timsort the fastest general purpose #sort out there much better than quicksort in many situations

if that is so you might find that timsort runs faster than quicksort


mouseout	mouseup---------------------------------------------------

middle notification earlier
this may make for various race conditions and may necessitate using events which give you earlier notification than mouseup mousedown mouseenter mouseleave mouseover mouseout

mousedown mouseup is indeed the only way you can get notified of middle button interaction so detecting a down-then-up event without intervening mouseout event is more or less the best you can do


others

nemerle	boo---------------------------------------------------

others
i read somewhere that nemerle s macro service is more powerful than boo s


dataframe	multi-index---------------------------------------------------

others
the real dataframe has more columns in the multi-index

i ve thought about multi-indices but i m already using the index for something else source of data row not shown here and i m afraid a three-level multi-index might make it more complicated for slicing the dataframe later


uptime	reboot---------------------------------------------------

others
yesterday i needed to reboot production server on debian 6 with more than 3-y uptime and 3rd party configured billing system on it


cpu	irq---------------------------------------------------

others
cannot sleep run atomically in soft irq context and are guaranteed to never run on more than one cpu of a given processors for a given tasklet

ten years ago intel vtune recommended not more than 1000 irq s www.cs.utah.edu mhall cs4961f09 vtune-1.pdf try to get about a 1000 samples per second per logical cpu

in some cases irq constitutes more than 8 of cpu for a process


puts	fflush---------------------------------------------------

others
the implication is that if you re writing a lot of small puts your memstore fflush will run faster but will produce smaller hfiles on disk than expected

for batch puts it s better if you construct a list of puts and then call because it uses a single rpc call to commit the batch but depending on the size of the list write buffer may fflush it all or not


devise	bcrypt-ruby---------------------------------------------------

others
how can i force devise to use the newer version of bcrypt-ruby that is in the gemfile 3.1.1 and not the auto installed dependency 3.0.1 because adding bcrypt-ruby 3.1.1 to gemfile and running bundle update install does does not seem to solve the problem


gmail	outlook.com---------------------------------------------------

others
in outlook.com hotmail it looks closer to the results shown with gmail


fink	macports---------------------------------------------------

stable top access
fink has more packages than macports

because fink is reputedly more stable than macports and has many more packages

on top of that fink gives you access to more packages than macports


others
since i have seen many reports of the macports package manager being less reliable than the fink package manager i would suggest installing fink and then simply doing

i second macports it is more up to date than fink and closer to the freebsd ports system where i come from


jpgraph	phpgraphlib---------------------------------------------------

others
jpgraph has far more capabilities than phpgraphlib


grepl	substr---------------------------------------------------

answer vectorised test
finally i also made a benchmark test which shows that substr operation is slightly better than sapply grepl and significantly better than vectorised grepl alone

therefore vectorized substr by david arenburg is the best answer while sapply grepl by sixiang.hu and significantly better than grepl by david arenburg


others

gdi	direct2d---------------------------------------------------

slower
but my direct2d code is much slower than my gdi code

a direct2d is slower than gdi


others
i suspect that they re bypassing gdi and using something more direct like the new directwrite and or direct2d apis

threads in direct2d is more granular than in gdi and gdi+ so that the

the thing is that gdi is still faster than direct2d if i draw to a bitmap and after it s done i bitblt the result back to the form it paints at 35ms and with the same graphics quality

a i tried gdi-compatible direct2d using id2d1dcrendertarget+binddc but it is much slower than pure gdi

disable antialiasing and the performance of direct2d will be on par or faster than gdi

i ve read that direct2d is much faster than gdi so i figured i would give it a shot for dealing with constantly updated variables


background-image	background-size---------------------------------------------------

others
however for some reason ulkit is making a background-size larger than my background-image

in chrome when you use background-size cover if the xpos of background-image is no less than 50 you will meet that problem


arraylist	treeset---------------------------------------------------

sort effective
so arraylist and sort is more effective than treeset

so i expected that treeset would be more effective then arraylist


others
note using treeset instead of hashset would give directly sorted arraylist and above collections.sort could be skipped but treeset is otherwise less efficent so it s often better and rarely worse to use hashset even when sorting is needed


border-color	background-color---------------------------------------------------

others
still if you don t want the elements background-color to span more 10px because of the transparency border and you do not want to set the border-color to match the background color you can use css content property like this


bokeh	matplotlib---------------------------------------------------

others
my guess is that imagergba in bokeh might be more similar to matplotlib s imshow but i m afraid i don t know

they have quite different approaches mpl3d enables the use of standard matplotlib plotting commands but with large datasets bokeh may be more useful

i m sure it can be accomplished with pure bokeh but i m looking to do a more advanced plot with bokeh which relies on matplotlib so i m looking to use show mpl.to_bokeh


lxml	libxslt---------------------------------------------------

others
also since lxml is based on libxml2 and libxslt you ll need less calls into the c api which can be quite expensive in my experience

libxml2 libxslt also come with their own much lower-level python bindings but lxml is much more straightforward and pythonic and it seems to have great performance as well


nodevalue	innerhtml---------------------------------------------------

others
nodevalue is a little more confusing to use but faster than innerhtml


punctuation	words---------------------------------------------------

data etc numbers
did pre-processing of the train data using nltk punctuation stop words removal lower case stemming etc.

and i need to be able to remove all of the punctuation convert to lower cases remove numbers stop words whitespaces from the data frame tweets without having to convert it into a corpus or something


characters longer spaces
note there are some cases you will have to handle here you may have to split at punctuation characters and hyphens and you may have to cope with a single words that is longer than the formatting width

entries with words that are longer than x characters in this case 25 with no punctuation or spaces will cause the html on a printed a4 page to not wrap properly and therefore not to confrom to certain sizes correctly pushing the margins off

in text files for example it is much more probable to have a small letter after a letter than a whitespace or punctuation after a letter since words typically are longer than 2 characters


first w use
alternatively you could accept a-za-z0-9 0 4000 note the space which should get you more than one words but probably not anything after the first punctuation

note that in case your words are separated with more than whitespace punctuation for example use w+


others
i need to replace all words with 3 or more letters with the words thing while retaining capitalization and punctuation

i am attempting to read a text file strip the punctuation make everything lower case then print the total number of words the total number of unique words meaning that a for instance if it is in the text 20 times will only be counted once then print the most frequently occuring words along with their frequency a 20

the pattern in scanner is supposed to be a regular expression that describes all the characters you don t want included in a token repeated one or more times this last part is because the words may be delimiter by more than one spaces punctuation etc.

tonight i m attempting to parse words from a file and i d like to remove all punctuation while preserving lower and upper case words as well as white spaces

i put an arbitary limit of 10 because i don t know of any words or abbreviations that contain punctuation and are more than a few characters

allow various punctuation symbols between words change the + to something like means space - are allowed between words -- add more to your liking but don t put . in to prevent the bold-ing from going over full stops

given the relatively simple decomposition words separated by white-space or punctuation i think a more prosaic solution may be necessary

now i have it so that the line is split into an array of strings using the .split method however it splits on white space and punctuation meaning that cities with names longer than one words won t work

for example english text has a particular kind of redundancy with some characters repeated more than others words that are repeated and more common than others certain words that are more likely to follow certain other words grammar punctuation structure etc

depending on how you want to treat the data you might also want to strip punctuation or go for more advanced words isolation with a break iterator - see the java.text package or the icu project


lower strings array
you might also want to consider sripping punctuation from words and calling lower if you consider cameroon and cameroon to be the same

i have a string array containing strings words with no punctuation marks all lower case

the was removed stopword cat is now singular stemming punctuation is gone and the words are lower cased


recv	epoll---------------------------------------------------

others
most particular platforms restrict the list of calls that can be interrupted to a smaller set than pthreads allows so you d have to look at the linux docs to be sure exactly what is and isn t eintr-safe but the epoll family of methods along with read recv write send and friends are almost certain to be unsafe


qtableview	qgraphicsscene---------------------------------------------------

others
technically this could also be done by customizing a qtableview widget but qgraphicsscene is more robust for custom graphics and performance


cassini	iis---------------------------------------------------

others
what i would suggest is to make sure you are using visual studio 2010 sp1 then install iis express which is an upgrade to cassini and is much more like real iis and then switch your project to use iis express and see if you get the same exception

iis express would only be used by people who don t have access to iis or want something that is lighter than iis but more like iis than cassini

perhaps you will have a more pleasant experience with iis 7.5 express as a replacement for cassini

cassini is not actually iis it is more of an emulation

by default the visual studio web servers cassini for older implementations iis express for newer implementations do not even bind to your network adapter s ip address instead only binding to localhost


integrated f5 crappy
granted iisexpress is much better than cassini but if there is no reason to not use full iis then i conitnue to advocate it s use

cassini was much better than iis express but doesn t properly support the integrated pipeline

while iis does give us better performance than cassini we would still like to be able to hit f5 to run our application from within visual studio

you are on vista iis got better 7 cassini stayed crappy


server purpose default
for my webapp the integrated visual studio server cassini ist much slower than iis

from this question i found out that iis server is better than cassini for my purpose but i don t know how to check the default server of my website


faster slower
i thought iis should be faster than or at least as fast as cassini

what could be the reason that makes iis slower than cassini


dependency-injection	singleton---------------------------------------------------

others
i did some research and read that singleton aren t exactly good practice and dependency-injection would be a better solution however i have no idea how to achieve this with dependency-injection


appfog	heroku---------------------------------------------------

others
i have no idea about appfog but heroku is more than capable for running scrapy


activiti	alfresco---------------------------------------------------

others
if the identifier really only makes sense in the context of a workflow then putting the logic in activiti and storing the data in some back-end separate from alfresco might make more sense


plone	buildout---------------------------------------------------

others
i ve even tried to pin archetypes and atcontentypes so that the buildout uses older versions example those used in plone 4.2 by adding the following to my pinnedversions.cfg file which gets called after everything else


triples	freebase---------------------------------------------------

others
since the api has been deprecated i m working with raw freebase dump which is now a list of 3.1 billion triples containing more than 500 million distinct entities subject object and i d like to reduce this number


rubymine	radrails---------------------------------------------------

others
webstorm + pycharm + rubymine + phpstorm though to be fair rubymine has more features than radrails atm


polymorphism	specialization---------------------------------------------------

others
while it can be argued that the example in the op does not exhibit static polymorphism the use of specialization can make a more compelling case


d3.js	highcharts---------------------------------------------------

others
i found d3.js to be rich library but highcharts is more interactive i guess


strtol	atof---------------------------------------------------

others
i understand that strtol and strtof are preferred to atoi atof since the former detect errors and also strtol is much more flexible than atoi when it comes to non-base-10

note atof and similar functions don t detect overflows and return zero on error so there s no way to know if it failed not sure if it sets errno see also keith s comments about undefined behaviour for certain values so the point is you should use strtol for converting from strings to int and strtod for converting to double those have much better error handling


glassfish	weblogic---------------------------------------------------

others
well glassfish is more right than jboss and weblogic business-bean-classes should all have their own ejb-local-interface

oracle s other application server weblogic still doesn t even fully support java ee 7 - both they and ibm seem to have similar strategies of maintaining stability in their full-fat releases while being more bleeding edge with glassfish for oracle and the liberty profile for ibm s websphere


prerequisites	uninstaller---------------------------------------------------

others
if we try to uninstaller or repair it it would show the install welcome screen and if we go further it would end up with our install condition failures because required prerequisites software is no more there


googletest	cppunit---------------------------------------------------

others
if you use older version of gcc compiler or if your code under tests runs on vxworks or vxsim you might have a better chance with cppunit than googletest framework


mvvm	delegatecommand---------------------------------------------------

others
for mvvm scenarios a relaycommand or delegatecommand is a better fit than the routedcommand which is provided with wpf


html2canvas	jspdf---------------------------------------------------

others
if you are okay with lower resolution of the pdf you can try using html2canvas library along with jspdf which is quiet easier approach


drawimage	putimagedata---------------------------------------------------

faster function slower
using drawimage canvas is much faster than using putimagedata

drawimage seems to be much faster than putimagedata

i have seen that the drawimage function is really faster than the putimagedata

as of right now drawimage is much faster than putimagedata

right now putimagedata is much slower than drawimage as you can see here


old browser earlier
the only problem that as far as i know using drawimage is slower than using putimagedata and it was required in old browser versions like firefox 2 or such

that beeing said putimagedata is much slower than drawimage at least when i tested them earlier this year


others
is putimagedata ... more performant than drawimage ...

using the clipping version of drawimage will be faster than putimagedata

if you get curious and discover the putimagedata function in the canvas 2d api please note that drawimage is much faster which might be unintuitive


getimagedata pixel manipulation
don t use getimagedata putimagedata for clipping since drawimage is easier and faster.

if you don t intend to do pixel manipulation you should only use drawimage without getimagedata putimagedata which are slower though


erlang	ocaml---------------------------------------------------

others
while erlang is more expressive ocaml pattern matching is simpler which means a simpler language definition compiler etc. and you still can do what you need at the cost of writing more code

haskell ml ocaml miranda alice oz erlang twelf coq prolog all demonstrate more rigorous applications of mathematics to programming


rcharts	rmaps---------------------------------------------------

others
possibly part of the reason of my problems is that the original code from ramnath uses rmaps while i m using rcharts also developed by ramnath as it is more developed better integrated with shiny and of course includes leaflet


ibatis	mybatis---------------------------------------------------

others
a data mapper tool like ibatis now mybatis will give you more flexibility


rtsp	rtcp---------------------------------------------------

others
the strange thing is that when streaming is done via rtsp unicast rtcp generates both sender reports and receiver reports but when streaming is done via rtp multicast only sender reports are generated


direct3d	gdi---------------------------------------------------

others
still i expect the vector based apis offered by opengl and direct3d should perform far more reliably - gdi line drawing is not something driver writers strive to optimize

so decide what you want to use direct3d is significaly faster than gdi


filtering	grouping---------------------------------------------------

others
solr - the collapsingqparser is really a post filtering that provides more performant field collapsing than solr s standard approach when the number of distinct grouping in the result set is high

or could you restructure into nested grouping to make it easier to filtering

2 i used link1 and link2 to filtering out duplicate users existing in more than one grouping

already to filtering by the elements of grouping 2 i need to use another query reducing the amount of cross join because grouping 2 has fewer types only types 4 and 5

this is easier done by filtering for a single date but because you said that companies might cease to exist at a given year i grouping data by month first

as for your latest edit i think it is better to first filtering the elements into a result tree fragment convert that into a node-set using exsl node-set or similar and then grouping using muenchian grouping as suggested earlier

if you upgrade to pandas 0.12 you can use the new filtering method on grouping which makes this more succinct and straightforward

i m playing around with stock data and i m trying to filtering the grouping that have more buys than sells with respective to transaction values

from my experience collapse filtering is much faster than grouping

this works perfectly fine but our company has more than 1000 grouping that would be imported if i don t set a filtering for grouping

2 filtering per grouping make sure the number of rows for the grouping is larger than 1 and then either the first gene starts with unknown which means the whole grouping contains unknown since unkown has been sorted to the end or take the first row

you query all and filtering on the client the more grouping you have the worse this method will be

i want to filtering and only get grouping that have more than 1 related contact

you can even specify if they are in the same collision category grouping using filtering to be more specific about which bodies collide with each other

filtering on the grouping data is more processing-intensive because the grouping must be completed first

filtering before the grouping by is usually more efficient because it reduces the amount of data needed to process the aggregation

when i select one or more nodes by grouping and try to filtering by one or more scenario_id property of the edge i would like to see all the dependent nodes of a certain depth ..n that depend on my selection and edge filtering

unfortunately this not possible using openldap because your filtering is returning more than 1 object multiple grouping each with a unique dn

so this will filtering out the grouping that have more than 1 nan values

in order to accomplish this what i ve done is created a sql query where i join the events for each location and then grouping by the location name and only use location grouping having more than 10 entries that filtering out the somewhat non-reliable entries but i still end up with some very different spellings and entries resulting in duplicate properties locations

if a user belongs to more than x grouping it may be more efficient to retrieve all results matching the keyword and then filtering them by group_id

you could do this with dplyr using mutate to convert missing boolean values to 0 group_by to compute grouping with constant values of variable boolean filtering to limit to grouping where boolean was set to 1 and where the grouping had more than one member and then summarize to grab the relevant summary information

you can do all grouping and use a simpler process to do it by using filtering and creating a simpler set of data arrays for comparisons

we then filtering all words from the given string if the length of any of the grouping is more than two

grouping by those columns filtering for grouping that have more than 1 entry expand those grouping export to csv

my question is if the grouping by only has a result of 1 row per grouping how is the having phase using that single grouping row to filtering out any grouping that have more than 1 row.

you can grouping the rdd by productid and then filtering it based on if the length of the grouping is larger than the threshold 1 here

another reason to consider this route is if parsing xml files is more complex than filtering off node values grouping elements assigning new ids filtering by attributes


greater count number
instead of in count aggregate use distinct column_name in count aggregate to filtering the grouping which is having more than one distinct values

i am using groupby on tickets then filtering my dataframe to those records where the count in that ticket grouping is greater than 1 using filtering

you can grouping by phone number and filtering those having count greater than 5

grouping that by acct to do the count by acct and when the result is greater than 1 filtering it using a having clause

we grouping by a filtering the grouping that have nrows greater than 1

this filtering will return only those grouping where the sum of othervalue of the rows in this grouping is greater than zero

if you want to filtering the grouping having less than 2 observations we can grouping by x and then filtering the number of rows n less than 2

filtering by topn_rank column to get the top n rows for each grouping prohibiting more than 3 per grouping

i am wanting to sum the amt by year and grouping and then filtering where the summed amt for any given grouping is greater than 100


results select row
if rows with same reference should go together in results then you should filtering out rows with reference equal to empty string then grouping all rows by reference and select only those grouping which have more than one row

you can use selectmany to get a flat sequence of all of the reviews from all of the results you can grouping those by name filtering out the grouping that have more than one item select out all of the items after the first and then remove all of those reviews from their result


query element item
filtering the grouping by grouping that have more than 1 element

you can create an object from each item containing it s index then grouping on the value and filtering out the grouping containing more than one object

then you filtering the grouping by taking only the grouping that have more than one item and thus remove the grouping that have a single item

then you filtering the grouping that have more than one element

extra grouping by clause in query 2 filtering records.to know more look at below example

an easy way to find duplicates is to write a query that grouping by the identifier and then filtering for grouping that have more than one member

for the life of me i can t figure out how to work with the values returned by the linq query to be able to then filtering all of the grouping that were returned so that i only have the grouping that have more than one item in them

what you ll want to do is grouping by courseinfoid then filtering on grouping that have more than 1 item which will get you all of the duplicate items


entry pmin pmax
use having clause to filtering the grouping which is having more than fkey

the having clause indicates that we want to filtering after the grouping to only show the grouping which have more than one entry

you can also use pmin and pmax to assist with grouping and then filtering on all grouping having more than one entry


gridview	entitydatasource---------------------------------------------------

others
i have entitydatasource with gridview is there any way to make the data in entitydatasource to be lower or upper case


imagemagick	magick++---------------------------------------------------

others
now i m trying to do the same thing with imagemagick to be more correct with magick++


disk	ram---------------------------------------------------

machine data computer
reloading pages data or program code from disk which is much slower does not usually happen very often as long as the program is actually running and as long as the machine is not desperately low on ram

but ram is volatile the data in ram is erased when the computer loses power and ram is far more expensive than disk per unit of storage

if the hot data won t fit in ram on either machine then disk i o performance becomes more important than ram mostly random read i o and the fsync flush rate


others
since using ram is faster than using disk zram allows linux to make more use of ram when swapping paging is required especially on older computers with less ram installed

a disk seek takes about 10 000 000 nanoseconds of course some disk are faster but the best of them are still thousands of times slower than ram

if your dataset is larger than your ram you ll be facing massive io delays on the scale of tens of milliseconds and upwards tens or hundreds of thousands of times because of all the required disk operations

as disk i o is orders of magnitude slower than ram i o this can cause a very significant difference in query execution times

once you re out of ram and the system starts swapping - disk access is thousands times slower than ram so any potential benefits of 64-bit code are flying out of window

number of cores cpus in slurm disk space and ram are more tricky to get as it might be different on different nodes

in addition jemalloc tries to optimise for cache locality since the act of fetching data from ram is much slower than using data already in the cpu caches no different in concept to the difference between fast fetching from ram versus slow fetching from disk

also keep in mind that once ram is exhausted your program will start running in virtual memory on disk which will probably cause far more disk i o activity than the program itself so if you re concerned about disk i o your best bet is probably to make sure that the batch of data you re working on in memory doesn t get much greater than available ram

saving information to a variable and therefore to ram is always faster than direct to disk

a cache miss at the cpu cache will load more data from ram a cache miss in ram will load more data from disk all this translates into reduced throughput

the cpu it s never over 20 of use we have plenty of ram and the disk never have more than 0.50 in the queue length

if for any node total resource allocation makes more than all ram cores disk available you are at risk most often at risk of spark task or yarn child being unable to start

the ssd is still slower than ram by orders of magnitude but it s quite reasonable to have a 50gb hash table on disk but not in ram unless you pay big money for big iron

disk files are of course an order of magnitude slower than ram and thrashing your virtual memory system could actually be worse than that depending on your access patterns

the data type text requires more space in ram and on disk is slower to process and more error prone

a larger cache reduces the number of reads but up to a certain limit also increases the amount of unsaved data that rethinkdb can accumulate in ram to make disk writes more efficient

and at worst impossible at all ram size is usually much less than disk size

to make things even worse in many cases your ram will be smaller than your os es complete disk usage forcing your system to use swap space ie

in other words the operating system is using some of your hard disk space to satisfy your 13 mb allocation request at great expense of speed since the hard disk is much much slower than ram

it is important to minimize the disk accesses - because disk are not random access and disk accesses are much slower then ram accesses

however be aware of this to cache pixels to disk is several orders of magnitude slower than using ram

since your disk even if it s an ssd is several orders of magnitude slower than ram the systems gets unresponsive

make sure you have enough ram so that your data set fits with ram atleast your index should fit inside the ram coz each time a data fetched from disk is 10 times slower than ram

access to disk is slower so when you ve written to a file it will be flushed to disk and no longer reside in ram which means that next time you need the file you might be going to get it from disk slow whereas in memory mapped files you know the file is in ram and you can have faster access to it then when it s on disk

first it creates 10 5gb files 50gb is way more than machine ram so not much help by os file-cache then starts a zookeeper client which is supposed to keep its connection with the zookeeper server up by sending pings heartbeats regularly then makes 10 threads doing random-access into the 10 files creating a lot of disk io but really no real usage of the cpu

the diminishing returns means that if you need more swap space than twice your ram size you d better add more ram as hard disk drive hdd access is about 10â³ slower then ram access so something that would take 1 second suddenly takes more then 15 minutes

that s basically possible but it would take hours as hard disk access is so much slower than accessing ram caches

but if your shared file system is a raid 5 or 6 array exported to the nodes via nfs over gige ethernet that will be slower than ram to ram transfer via gige using rpc or mpi because you have to write and read the disk over gige anyway

is there any way to read and write in ram instead of file as disk read costs more time

if lob-storage isn t in ram at the time of a query execution then we need to read it from a disk which is of course much slower than from ram

there are libraries that allow on-disk data structures comes to mind and another one whose name i can t recall at the moment but disk accesses are orders of magnitude slower than ram

disk is bigger than ram

the difference between disk speed and ram speed is more or less an arithmetic factor

so even if your ram is much smaller than your disk you could assume you can read data that s already in ram 90 of the time or more

pros of objects faster disk read is slower than ram lesser dependencies of the system s state

if the amount of ram is less you ll have a lot of swapping to disk which is a lot more time consuming

if the table is larger than ram you will likely have a single disk io per access the intermediate index levels will be cached

using multiprocessing is probably not going to speed up reading data from disk since disk access is much slower than ram access or calculations

the first load involves reading alot from the hard disk which is slow even ssd is slower than ram subsequent loads should be faster though 3 seconds on the ssd seem to be odd

accessing the main memory ram is much faster than reading values from the hard disk

memory is a bottleneck to performance ram runs slower than the cpu and if you re paging to disk than it s really slow

however if this is indeed the case - and the data does not fit ram and you cannot use map-reduce i suspect sorting and iterating - though will be o nlogn will be more efficient using external sort - because the number of disk accesses will be minimized and disk access is much slower then ram access

at any rate disk speeds are orders of magnitude lower than the ram speed and i wouldn t be too much concerned about the mode here unless of course it turns out that caching is different in the two modes

i would say that probably yes as long as we have enough of ram which is faster that virtual memory in case we need to access something from the disk which is extremely slow... but also i know that some applications just require having paging

note when the data is much bigger than ram performance degenerates into counting the disk hits .

there are tonnes of posts blogs on this so just google mongodb working set but as you know access from ram rather paging to disk is quicker

all of rsfalcon7 s suggestions can be combined into a super rule do as much as possible in unshared resources l1 l2 caches - implying economizing on code and data requirements - and if you need to go to shared resources do as much as possible in l3 before going to ram before using synchronization the cpu cycles required to synchronize is variable but is slower - or much slower - than accessing ram before going to disk

it is the ram used for faster access to disk.it is embedded in the disk or it can be portion of main memory set aside

because hard disk have a much slower memory than ram virtual private server performance may slow down considerably

if your working set is larger than your ram the operating system will be constantly swapping pages out to disk to make room to swap in pages that an application wants to access

any db tech is fine with me as long it does not need lots of ram and uses less disk

on the other hand table variables usually with smaller data are kept in memory ram making them faster to access and therefore less disk io in terms of using the tempdb drive when using table variables with smaller data compared to temporary tables which always log in tempdb

your computer ram can hold more byte values before it starts having to use the hard disk as virtual memory

in this case the latter is likely to cause trouble because the insertion of a name hits a random node in the tree i.e the name insertion doesn t follow a pattern and your ram is smaller than the index chances are high that the destination must be fetched from disk

reading audio files from ram is much faster than reading audio files from hard disk

also ram bandwidth is much higher than disk or ssd or network bandwidth and the ram latency is much lower too

as sven marnach wrote in the comments your problem is most likely i o bound since disk access is orders of magnitude slower than ram access

so my question is how to move this database into ram where i can access it via sqlite3_open or if my idea is bullshit and leaving the database on disk is faster than moving it into ram via mapping

basically if your tables fit comfortably in ram you are better off reporting from them since you are keeping disk i o free for the wal segment commit of your event entry

but becuase reading from ram is usually faster than from other kind of memory storage divice os copy the program from disk on ram and start executing program from there

i m sure there are other holes like that too - but the code above will work on any system which supports paging and where disk access is much more expensive than ram access


available larger files
i ve written my own protocol since i need it to be lightweight and i m sending files that may be bigger than the ram available on the device â â therefore the files are being streamed straight from the network to disk

in future these lists may be read from disk and larger than available ram

modern operating systems usually get in the way especially if the file is larger than ram you will end up swapping code since the system will treat your already stored on disk data as swappable

it uses swap space on disk to allow for processes much larger than ram

edit true the file on disk is not larger than ram but the in-memory representation can easily become much larger than available ram

if you use map_shared | map_noreserve you can use a memory map much larger than available ram + swap -- but if you run out of disk space or quota your process will receive and die from a sigbus signal.

alternatively you can use an ssd with file storage in varnish to reduce disk io bottlenecks when using an object cache larger than available ram

the os heap uses the cpu s virtual memory hardware and is free from fragmentation issues and can even effectively use the disk s swap space allowing you to allocate more memory than available ram

since the files are all bigger than ram this translates to actual disk usage

it is needed for a lookup of repetitions in disk files much larger than available ram

writing to a local database or handling a data structure larger than ram will impact the disk making network calls will impact the network hardware cpu bound calculations will impact there

just because you have data that is larger than your ram amount doesn t mean the node should go down it just means that not all documents will be available in ram and the node will sometimes have to fetch from disk slower

if your working data set is larger than available ram your server may spend a lot of time shuffling files from disk to memory

in the past the redis developers experimented with virtual memory and other systems in order to allow larger than ram datasets but after all we are very happy if we can do one thing well data served from memory disk used for storage

the workspace limit is on non-free hosted workspaces any workspace that s private or larger than 1gb disk space and 512mb ram ssh workspaces are unlimited


efficient hit mysql
location of the input sorting algorithms on disk are different from algorithms on ram because disk reads are much less efficient when not sequential

thus you would get a small performance hit while linux moved it back into ram swapfiles are more efficient at this than mysql would be moving it from the disk

the amount of data in stream is bigger than machine ram or its disk space so it needs to relatively efficient


expensive data scarce
relational database systems do their own disk swapping of course partly because they were designed when ram was more expensive and partly because they still sometimes deal with unusually large volumes of data

you lose two benefits of data base consistency data persists after a crash and you need more ram which is more expensive and scarce than disk flash

i should also mention that this happens once the data is larger than ram and it s increasing size on the disk

data in ram can take a lot more space than on disk

however they may be cheaper to operate depending on how much data you are expecting to store with each session key holding large quantities of data in ram is typically more expensive than storing on disk

basically ram is more expensive than the disk storage

though writing and reading in the same block of code makes little sense in real life as you should still have the data you ve written and because i o to disk are much more expensive than the ram you were using to keep the data so you may just do


system typical modules
this is slow because your hard disk is significantly slower than ram and at 7gb there will be a lot of data being read from your hard disk put into ram then moved back to your page file the file on disk your operating system uses to store data that has been copied out of ram

there exist battery-backed packages of ram modules which can act as an ultra-fast hdd substitute but if they attach via sata scsi or other typical disk interface the still are slower than system ram


amount random larger
when your working set exceeds the amount of ram then it will carry on working but with noticeably degraded performance as things will then be constantly having to go to disk which is far less performant

at some point if you re doing randomish queries and your working set is sufficiently larger than ram then you ll be limited by the small number of random iops a disk can do

if your data size is larger than the amount of ram you can afford you can try to compensate with faster disk and using more smaller disk 8 x 74gb instead of 4x 136gb

so while the writes my be sequential on disk for datasets larger than ram these random reads will quickly become the bottle neck


cheaper space usage
always favor disk persistence disk storage is cheaper than ram

disk space and ram are far cheaper than your labor and they are cheaper than a delay getting your project completed and into the hands of users

this is well within disk space but far larger than ram

disk space is probably always going to be cheaper than ram

i want to cut large csv files file size more than ram size and use them or save each in disk for later usage

i m not sure if or how some other limits are imposed if available disk space or available ram are less than the software limits

so everything here should require no work on your part not consume more ram not consume more disk space impose no other overheads never freeze and give you a nice speedup

this approach will radically reduce heap space usage - disk space is cheaper then ram too


4gb enough jboss
for this reason i deployed a 2 cores 4gb ram and more than enough disk to run through the getting started example of the enterprise integrator

this particular jboss runs in a vm with 4gb of ram and 2 cpu s and more than enough disk space it has never has less than 5gb free at any time


table smaller slowest
that 1st code takes virtually no ram as it creates from the disk making it smaller by simply skipping pixels from the image

and the whole purpose of maglev is to have a ruby implementation which can deal with heaps that are orders of magnitude larger than ram by storing them in a distributed cluster on disk

the table on disk is bigger than your ram

if the working set is smaller than your ram it should not be disk bound

it sounds like the table is a lot larger than ram so this means something like 5555 disk reads -- likely to be the slowest part


faster slower memory
disk drives and ram are getting cheaper much faster than your time is

no trivial support for cache accessing ram is faster than accessing disk

disk access is much slower than ram

only one disk read - since the disk is much slower then ram -

1 yes there is a obvious benefit reading from ram is faster than reading from disk

ram is much faster then disk io

i understand that ram is typically thousands of times faster than disk but i o speed is not the only code running

remember the tuples are saved into the disk which is vastly slower to access than things in ram

but you should consider that disk io is way slower than ram

or if there is too much intermediate output to be shuffled your job will become slow as you will need disk based shuffle in such a case which will be slower than ram based shuffle

the idea is to get the library and application loaded from ram into ram which is much faster than loading from disk

anyway you will have a huge performance loss due to the fact that your disk is way slower than your ram

for this reason it seemed natural to me to initially load the file into memory and interpret it later at my leisure since reading from ram is supposed to be much faster than from disk

which will lead to performance issue all programs will be work slower because read info from disk is slower than from ram

that means that without caching a hit against disk will be 200 times slower than accessing ram

when disk get faster then so does ram and processors and the demand on devices

ssd disk are good but they are still much slower than ram

disk even ssd are orders of magnitude slower than ram

it won t do anything to change the fact that disk io is orders of magnitude slower than ram

so even ignoring practical considerations like disk is slower than ram it will be slower

this is relatively slow since reading from the hard disk is slower than reading from ram

ram is a lot faster than disk

if so just throw in some more ram or get a faster disk array.

for the stand of file operations writing to memory ram is always faster than writing to the file on the disk directly

the ram is much faster than the hard disk

ram is a lot faster than disk so reads and writes are temporarily stored until the data is requested by the code or the disk is able to receive it

my assumption in the question above is that disk is as fast as ram or faster than ram

because disk access is orders of magnitude slower than ram access

ram is always faster than disk

disk i o is about 100 000 times slower than ram

query speed is mainly limited by disk i o speed which is at least 1000 times slower than cpu ram speed

we all know that the access to ram memory is faster than access to hard disk

ram is 100 thousand times faster than disk for database access from

remember disk is 1000s of times slower than ram

the initial read has to access the disk which is a lot slower than accessing ram

caching and buffering are quite important since disk are just so much slower than ram and ram is much slower than the cpu

just wanted to weigh in my two cents what serialworm and thephpdeveloper said share the fact that memory ram is much faster than any disk io bound operation you come up with

if too much memory is consumed it might swap to disk which is slower than ram

memory is thousands of times faster than disk so if something gets read often having it in ram is drastically faster

buy as much memory as you can afford ram is alway faster than io from disk

disk io will be slower than ram

if the worker processes do other things than just calulations read from or write to disk they will have to wait a lot since a disk is a lot slower than ram

as disk is 1000s of times slower than ram this problem can grind the machine down to a practical halt

as disk is 1000s of times slower than ram as the memory usage increases your machine grinds more and more closer to a halt

disk is 100x slower than ram

i think it is because the disk is slower than ram

as you run queries it has to fetch data from disk which is much slower than ram

loosely speaking ram is 1000 or more times faster than disk and cpu is faster still

get more ram themore ram you have the more data can live in cache which is 1000 times faster than reading from disk

ram is much faster than disk

disk io - even ssd - is many orders of magnitude slower than the ram that the hashing is going though

changing it will require a reboot. that will slow things down a bit as the swap file on disk is much slower than ram

run the following to sort the data on disk this is slower than pulling it into ram sorting and then writing to disk

when the data is in memory - you can do anything much faster on it since disk io is extremely slower then ram so sorting it and reading it multiple times is expected to be much slower then manipulating the data on memory

obviously reading a block from cache is much more efficient than reading it off the disk since ram is much faster than disk


access
more ram means less disk access

and ram access is much more fast than disk access


jspm	npm---------------------------------------------------

others
assuming that you are building a webapp jspm is more suitable for managing your frontend dependencies than npm

lately i have been experiencing that an jspm install more often then not results in a status 500 being returned by the server whenever angular packages are being downloaded via npm

jspm is more commonly used to bring in client-side front-end libraries and npm for server-side ones


hidapi	libusb---------------------------------------------------

others
so you can either use hid manager apis directly or you can use libusb or as the other answer mentions hidapi which are nothing more than wrapper libraries over hid manager apis

also if this controller is an hid the hidapi library might be a better fit than libusb


haskell	idris---------------------------------------------------

others
in dependently-typed languages like idris it s probably more useful than in haskell


netbsd	minix---------------------------------------------------

others
i want test unix-like operating systems on historicial computers like commodore amiga atari st and i386 cpu and run posix compatible apps like pkgsrc x window system and blackbox wm for 40mhz higher versions minix 1.5 is best os for those systems better than netbsd but it is not posix-compatible


instances	transient---------------------------------------------------

others
manual and basic scaling instances also allow much longer deadlines 24 hours but very long-running requests may fail occasionally due to transient issues or upgrades


d3.js	flot---------------------------------------------------

others
though flot may be simpler d3.js is definitely more powerful


richtextbox	textblock---------------------------------------------------

others
good advice but in the end i decided a bindable textblock was more useful and simpler than a richtextbox


mouse	trackpad---------------------------------------------------

others
the trackpad is much more sensitive and can get the breakpoint increment correctly but the mouse wheel ends up scrolling through the section much quicker without correctly keeping up with the proper frame rate so i never end up reach the final frame by the end of the section

unfortunately the trackpad s scrolling deltas are orders of magnitude higher than a mouse s so the scroll speed is psychotically high

let s boil your trouble down to this if the mouse is over #inner you can t use the usual methods spacebar arrow keys trackpad wheel to scroll #outer up and down


noexcept	throw---------------------------------------------------

others
noexcept allows for more efficient code generation in that it does not have to perform rtti on throw exceptions instead if an exception is throw from a call-frame underneath a noexcept-declared function std terminate is called short-circuiting the crazy std unexpected machinery specified by the 98 standard

on the other hand if you are certain that the body may not throw you may want to declare it noexcept to be more explicit and help the compiler optimize but be careful if you choose to do this because if a destructor of any member ancestor of your class decides to throw your code will abort at runtime

i ve heard that noexcept keyword is more like it should never throw an exception rather than it doesn t

unwound before program execution is terminated. he said code using noexcept is more optimized than code using throw

noexcept was added rather than just removing all throw specifiers other than throw because noexcept is more powerful


leaflet	proj---------------------------------------------------

others
while leaflet aims to be more lightweight than openlayers openlayers is by far the more mature proj


dreamweaver	aptana---------------------------------------------------

others
i had previously used aptana 3 for a couple days and may have come to the conclusion that it is better than dreamweaver at actual html css coding


adplus	procdump---------------------------------------------------

others
if you have a customer who is willing to work with you a bit it might shed some light on the situation to get a crash dump with adplus or maybe simpler with sysinternals procdump when the error message is showing


jedi	python-mode---------------------------------------------------

others
if it s too slow i would ditch the autocompletion part of python-mode because it uses rope which is slower than jedi


subtract	addition---------------------------------------------------

others
however if the result a is added to or subtract from another expression and not reused then starting with the division may be more interesting since you can group the multiplication with the following addition by using a fma thus with a single rounding

when the alu gets a command to subtract it is given 2 numbers - it makes a not to every bit of the second number and makes a simple addition and adds 1 more because 2 s complement is not to every bit +1

strict addition is rare but subtraction is more common like when you subtract one image from its filtered one

if you continue to use your method of performing this task then you need to manually check if the addition of the two lower order decimal digits has caused a carry by checking if the result of the addition is greater than 10 and if it is subtract 10 from the number and then add 1 to the higher order digit calculation


level instructions division
on most processors a boolean operation has no reason to significantly be slower or faster than an addition both are basic instructions even though comparison may take two of them subtract then comparing to zero

division is performed by repeated subtraction therefore needs more level of subtract logic making division slower than addition

since addition can be faster then subtraction we add the offset instead of subtract it from 31


sudo	passwd---------------------------------------------------

others
automating sudo is slighly more complex if you need to pass the passwd but still can be done

thanks to a suggestion in the comments i removed the passwd from the server declaration since i think getting sudo to work without a passwd is a cleaner solution anyway

as a note the su command is much older than sudo and the normal procedure before sudo was to su to root and then to another user unless you knew the passwd of that other user

of course this is no fewer keystrokes than sudo python although at least you wouldn t need to enter a passwd

sudo is better in most respects but still requires a passwd which asroot does not

this is partly to make passwd stealing wrappers harder but is mostly useful so that things like some-command | sudo othercommand work even if sudo has to prompt for a passwd

you can enable the root account and set a passwd but jumping to it with sudo is the better method


appdata	uninstaller---------------------------------------------------

others
i try reinstall after uninstaller delete all leftover data and delete c users yourusername appdata roaming pgadmin delete all data inside pgadmin folder

unfortunately looks like it requires uninstaller and reinstall as the locations seems to have changed drastically from some subsubsub folder off of appdata to something higher up under user directory


scipy	scikit-learn---------------------------------------------------

others
i didn t dig on why scikit-learn gives such unprecise result but it seems scipy gives better precision


cucumber	concordion---------------------------------------------------

others
i ve not tried them but common opinion is they re less mature than cucumber jbehave concordion rspec etc


openssl	gnutls---------------------------------------------------

others
openssl is more similar to peter gutmann s cryptlib and gnu s gnutls

i ve generally gone with openssl though gnutls is newer perhaps better

speaking about usability personally i would prefer gnutls api but at the time openssl looks more preferable to use


restsharp	refit---------------------------------------------------

others
i have used restsharp before but refit is alot easier to get running


chisel	verilog---------------------------------------------------

others
the mismatch between blackbox and module io emission is a legacy api for better integration with verilog ip where the chisel designer has little to no control over the verilog


sdl	xlib---------------------------------------------------

others
in my experience xlib via mit-shm extension was significantly faster than sdl surfaces not sure i used sdl in the most optimal way though


ftp	telnet---------------------------------------------------

others
yes i know ftp is better than telnet but right now i m stuck with telnet

telnet and sftp in favor of ftp or consider wrapping less secure

telnet is more general than ftp and is generally used for command and control


form example complex
ftp protocol is more complex than http or telnet form example

it is optimized for downloading larger files where the setup overhead is amortized over the size and number of downloads http is very light-weight you can communicate to an http server using telnet much easier than ftp especially before passive ftp and is designed around html -- the concept that in the course of your navigation you will be visiting many different servers and grabbing only a couple of files at a time from each


vim	notepad++---------------------------------------------------

others
lately i have used notepad++ a bit more than vim

in vim they re more of a placeholders for splits so my guess is you ll have a hard time working with them if you mean to just copy your notepad++ s way of work to vim


pandas	xlrd---------------------------------------------------

others
i m using python and can t decide which of xlrd xlwt or pandas would be more useful


filesystems	hfs+---------------------------------------------------

others
hfs+ supports much larger files than hfs block addresses are 32-bit length instead of 16-bit and uses unicode utf-16 encoding to name files folders and other filesystems objects


memcached	apc---------------------------------------------------

others
apc gives you some more functionality than memcached

memcached is faster than apc as zend_cache backend but you still need apc extension installed even in development mode to get a great speedup of your code

please don t mention memcached i am already using it but it is not suitable as direct replacement of apc because i am doing many apc_fetch calls because apc is much faster than memcached for this purpose

memcached has more overhead since you have to use a tcp connection to access it versus just a function call for apc xcache shared objects

memcached is more along the lines of a distributed object cache vs something like apc or xcache which stores php bytecode in memory so you avoid having to parse it each time

apc have less feature than memcached and is easly to use and optimize but this depends on your needs

better use apc on apache server it will be much faster than memcached because you don t need to make a tcp ip call to connect to memcached

the big caveat here is that apc generally has less memory available for storage though. default being 32mb memcached s big adavantage is that while still fast it s distributed so if you have multiple servers running they could share this data


faster single slower
it s slower than apc but it s faster than memcached redis etc

a quick googling says that apc is 5 times faster than memcached

as you know apc is much more faster than memcached if we re fetching keys from a single server

memcached around 4-5 times slower than apc but run as a single process that can be touched everywhere in my environment

apc is faster on a single server - but memcached is distributed

apc access is a bit faster something like 5 times faster than memcached if i remember correctly as it s only local -- no network involved

memcached has more functionality but is intended for distributed environments while apc works on single servers only

in my case apc is 59 times faster than memcached

my experience say that apc is nearly 7-8 times faster than memcached

memcached is in-memory too and a bit slower than apc


caching database memory
memcached is more for caching database queries and improving performance in that regard while apc is more for improving performance of php code

apc is more an opcode caching system than a key value memory database like memcached altough it can be greatly used for both purposes


better setup results
on a single server setup i am assuming apc would be better then memcached for this

if you site is located on single box you will get much better results with apc which unlike memcached is not distributed by nature


onreadystatechange	onload---------------------------------------------------

others
it looks like the onload function is a more modern convenience method and the old way of checking the result is using onreadystatechange instead


mouse	keyboard---------------------------------------------------

easier better windows
essentially you want the mouse to be an option but the keyboard to be a better easier more convenient one

the only thing i can think of that is easier with the mouse than with the keyboard is resizing windows


others
ie ignores the changed tab order when the select box value which triggers the change to the tabindex attribute is changed by some keyboard action arrow keys but does not ignore the tabindex change when the select box value is changed with the mouse see more detailed explanation

but when i press page down button from keyboard it works fine but when i scroll using mouse takes bit more time to load data and scrollbar of gridview displays abnormal

for other readers not satisfied i ll tell my story before you read you must know i m that type of developers who love using the cli and thinks that keyboard shurtcuts are faster than using a mouse if you don t agree may be this setup is not for you

for example do you use keyboard more than mouse

since this structure is not exactly related to game logic and technically it can then be reused by implementing an interface for the callback so that you can use this keyboard elsewhere where you want to have your player to type letters using mouse it s better be separated from main logic

i want to do it with the mouse as well but i imagine it will be a very similar process and i think but i might be wildly mistaken that starting with the keyboard will be easier

the first issue i am not sure how to solve is that i wish for the first three tabs keyboard media remote and mouse to be larger than the settings tab which i will change to an icon if possible

the last fallback is to go the snail way - to mouse over to click on the red close window button but any mouse movements are slower than a keyboard shortcut

since clicking the mouse is significantly more difficult for me than typing i was wanting to make a simple program that would just run in the background and click the mouse for me any time i press a specific key on the keyboard

and then all your users are relying on your left right controls no matter whether they re using a mouse or the keyboard which gives you more control over how it looks at each stage

your idea is good but have to consume events came from keyboard add there keylistener only with e.consume because glasspane to consume only mouse events

it recommends using ctr cmd + 1 to use the keyboard this is much better than having to use the mouse but i m still looking for a just do the right thing most of the time automatic solution

this is a radical concept i know but the mouse is slower than keyboard shortcuts

in general it s more noticeable with mouse than keyboard

also in this case keyboard input is essential and more important than mouse interaction

if you plan on working off of the laptop by itself without external mouse kb monitor more than 60 of the time than the macbook pro with it s larger keyboard and monitor would be better suited

i am trying to make the function that is triggered when that element is clicked with the mouse be more accessible so that you don t need to only use your mouse but also a keyboard shortcut - so to trigger it on keydown - ie

i prefer the command line because i have a shell window open in the source anyway to run builds and tests and along with file name completion using the keyboard is faster than using the mouse for me

i need to change my dropdown menu which works well with a mouse but i would like to make it more accessible with keyboard


hand close good
there is an addon that can even remove the menu bar â you ll need to learn keyboard shortcuts this is a good idea anyway moving a hand to from the mouse is much slower

the ctrl key is usually close by my keyboard hand and in combination with the mouse is faster than the page up page down keys


slower faster
doing it with mouse is much more slower than it can be done with keyboard

the keyboard is almost always faster than the mouse


vbscript	vba---------------------------------------------------

others
i ve written vbscript but the similarities to vba cause me more angst than ease

and since you asked for a work-around if you have access to visual studio you could whip up a little com-visible class library that exposes a .net-flavored regex much more similar to java s than vbscript s api that you could reference and use in your vba code

vb6 vba though a little better than vbscript in general still has many similar issues where for their domain they require much more boiler plate to do simple tasks than what i would like and have seen in other scripting languages

i believe that the reports are using something more along the lines of vbscript edit oregonghost says vba which actually makes more sense than vbscript than vb.net and very limited at that


openssl	m2crypto---------------------------------------------------

others
m2crypto is no longer maintained and doesn t work with openssl 1.0 and newer


ciimage	uiimage---------------------------------------------------

others
it seems like if the uiimage is slightly larger the ciimage is double the size whereas if the uiimage is slightly smaller this isn t the case


chown	chmod---------------------------------------------------

others
but changing the chmod maybe even working with umask is better than dealing with root-access and using chown


parseint	ceil---------------------------------------------------

others
the math.floor ceil method being marginally faster than parseint and mod


centos	linux---------------------------------------------------

outputs verison sudo
some of linux distributions use older python version for root user like centos .have a look at the outputs of which python and sudo which python you ll see they might be different

some of linux distributions use older python version for root user like centos .if the python verison you re running with sudo isn t correct you can t access those modules installed by pip


others
the pattern-based version installed by default on red hat-based linux distros fedora centos etc is simpler

one one ubuntu distro fuser -n tcp 3000 will report a process if i own the process yet on another linux distro i think centos it won t report the process even if i own it

also very particular that this should be done on centos or amazon linux which makes things worse for me as i have been on ubuntu for long

you can use alpine linux docker image it is very light and is better than both ubuntu and centos image to be used as the docker


linefeed	delimiter---------------------------------------------------

others
i ve taken the example of two linefeed here but the same is true for any character string i could subvert the problem by maybe taking a longer string as the delimiter but that would have two undersirable effects


xfce	kde---------------------------------------------------

others
since the more mainstream wms like gnome or kde become more and more resource hungry it wasn t long before i replaced gnome with xfce on laptops and desktop computers


markermanager	markerclusterer---------------------------------------------------

others
the markermanager has a more involved setup than the markerclusterer but it does allow for more customization of what and where it displays


build.gradle	gradlew---------------------------------------------------

others
i double checked the build.gradle s and synced the gradlew files once more

although build.gradle has a higher priority so the value in androidmanifest.xml will be ignored by gradlew while building your application

question is there a way to define conditional dependency in the build.gradle or another settings file so that a particular gradlew version is used for the build process that is ensured to be in compliance with the available java version either 1.6 or 1.8 either by manual definition or better by letting gradlew decide which version of itself to use

i naively assumed that gradlew is better than ivy then when i created my build.gradle the dependency management is even greater mess than of ivy s for the first look

i use gradlew and want to create a string in my build.gradle which goes over more than one line to make it more readable


ravendb	couchdb---------------------------------------------------

others
ravendb more than couchdb but that s neither here nor there


gtk	cairo---------------------------------------------------

others
with gtk it s more common to use cairo already mentioned by jeff foster

the problem is that the canvas drawn by cairo is larger than the area of gtk s scrolled_window


treemap	linkedhashmap---------------------------------------------------

others
linkedhashmap is faster for insertion because it wonâ t have to unnecessarily compare values while inserting like treemap as stated by ejp

it sounds like you need a treemap which has iteration which is not much slower than linkedhashmap and does what you really want

however a linkedhashmap is faster as seen here treemap has o log n performance for containskey get put and remove according to the javadocs while linkedhashmap is o 1 for each.

consider using a linkedhashmap or a treemap to maintain a more reasonable ordering

you can use treemap instead of linkedhashmap because you dont want to retain the order of insertion and for sorting treemap is better choice

a treemap costs a lot more than a linkedhashmap and adds nothing to your project if you only need to keep original insertion order


texreg	stargazer---------------------------------------------------

others
yet from my point of view texreg is more efficient that stargazer and easier to customize than xtable


jsdom	cheerio---------------------------------------------------

others
jsdom jquery offer complete set of tools but cheerio is much faster

if it is unavoidable node.js has good options - try to use the module cheerio which is faster than heavy weight jsdom

there s also jsdom but cheerio is simpler and comes with jquery-like goodness

i had the same problem with jsdom and switcht to cheerio which is much faster than jsdom and works even after scanning hundreds of sites

if you don t need a full dom available and just want to parse and scrape manipulate html elements there is cheerio which is more lightweight than jsdom and still gives you a jquery-like api

i find request + cheerio to be easier than jsdom for tasks like this


geany	gedit---------------------------------------------------

others
if you re fine with moving to another text editor then i would strongly recommend geany which does the same thing as gedit but is more fully-featured and can allow for execution of code in the same application


jsf	wicket---------------------------------------------------

others
in my opinion this is a more elegant solution than jsf and i think tapestry s ioc container makes it more powerful than wicket

i would advise you to try wicket it is very easy to learn much easier than jsf and it let s you re-use many existing components as well

i m in the hate it part so anything i said is biased plus in our test prototypes developing in wicket was faster than jsf

while this is much less convenient than stateful wicket i still find much better than say stateless jsf or struts

and beware that in this area there are many much more alternatives or fragmentation than in .net some more oriented to the mvc pattern struts struts2 stripes spring mvc some more component-based jsf tapestry wicket and some others gwt


watij	webdriver---------------------------------------------------

others
i can see the usage of watin and watij reducing as more developers move to selenium 2.0 webdriver which will offer the same functionality as watir using a different api and multiple programming languages


oncreate	onstart---------------------------------------------------

others
instead you use other lifecycle methods that are more appropriate such as onstart which will be called both after oncreate when the activity is first created and when the activity is returning to the foreground from having been in the background

onstart is less commonly used than oncreate

in my fragments data handling is taking place starting from oncreate which happens earlier than onstart


ssl	https---------------------------------------------------

others
https can be quite slow over a 3g connection as the overhead in terms of number of packets to setup an ssl connection is higher than a plain tcp connection.

if i try to add more than 1 ssl binding i get the error at least one other site is using the same https binding and the binding is configured with a different certificate ...

https is more flexible than ssl an application can configure the level of security it needs

i already understand that just encrypting form data is an extremely weak practice compared to using tls ssl and won t stop people who are determined to break the encryption from doing it so please refrain from any you should be using https -only comments though if you know a free hosting provider that allows https i d be more than happy too hear about them

ssl the s in https has more states but since it follows a fairly linear progression does not really have any kind of complex diagram

for basic authentication over ssl there are some easier workarounds if it is possible to have the web site change to allow https and basic auth that would be easiest

-security concerns if this is a web application which i think it is as you mentioned lightweight you re better off with a ssl certificate which encrypts all traffic to from your server by using https

if you are using the standard port testing for will also work but of course checking if https is used is better than testing if the port is the default ssl port

you can handle it on your server side by using your hosting cpanel plesk etc.simply change all request the type on both http and https if you want to enable only https requests then configure it on only https .for more details how to configure and enable ssl on godaddy kindly view full details on the given link

i m assuming using https without a ssl certificate is atleast more secure than doing the exact same connection over plain http since atleast it s encrypted and an evildoer would have to make a much larger effort to intercept en decrypt the information


host ip virtual
as far as i know you cannot configure more than one https virtual host for each ip that s it name based virtual hosting is limited to only one ssl virtual host

there is a limitation on creating virtual hosts for name based virtual host while using ssl 443 port so if you want to have more than one https port enabled you will need ip based virtual hosting

it could be a sni problem if you use any kind of load balancer https proxy or more than 1 ssl certificate on the same ip


better tls
always use tls which is ssl which is https more or less

ssl tls provide better encryption decryption over https


handshake anybody bandwidth
this being said the rfc 6125 guidelines meant to be applicable to any protocol that uses ssl tls are more or less the same as those for https which are defined in rfc 2818 http over tls section 3.1

the ssl handshake overhead associated with https is more than 50 of the bandwidth currently

http is slightly more performant than https as the ssl handshake doesn t need to happen however anybody hackers can see everything that your users can see


http switch page
as last resort resolution i don t suggest this for security issues using ssl is always safer switch your registry to use http instead of https

you can optionally handle http 403.4 code ssl required more gracefully by automatically redirecting the client to the https version of the page

you could always use https that will work both on http and https websites but loading a https resource is slower than loading a http resource because of the encryption and ssl handshakes


verilog	vhdl---------------------------------------------------

others
my experience is that designers can use whichever they prefer usually and most agree that verilog is easier to use and the code is shorter fact than equivalent vhdl

it used to be that vhdl had more non-synthesizable language features that aided verification that old-school verilog

vhdl is more popular in europe and verilog is dominating in the us

3 - find a book on vhdl read the chapter on delta delays assignments and your verilog will be much better

first let me say that i m more experienced with verilog but have been plugging away with vhdl for awhile trying to fix this issue

yes vhdl was once much more feature-rich than verilog but later revisions of the language verilog 2001 verilog 2005 systemverilog etc.. have cherry-picked most of the interesting features and there is far more robust toolchain support for verilog and its variant these days in addition to it being the dominant language in use in the us in my experience vhdl is only used here when dealing with extreme legacy blocks and in academic contexts partially due to the tools support mentioned previously

pacoblaze was written in verilog which like adam said less common than vhdl

by these numbers and only these numbers vhdl seems to be more widely-used than verilog


interpolation	splines---------------------------------------------------

others
of course you could do fancier interpolation with a splines being the next step

if you are doing more than three points however i would strongly recommend using interpolation as using guassian elimination scales incredibly poorly o n 3 and splines or another interpolation technique are less likely to fail

splines are used for smoother interpolation that ensures curvature continuity

edit2 you can try to make a coarse sin grid and use gsl routine gsl_interp_cspline_periodic for splines with periodic conditions to splines that table the splines will reduce the errors in comparison to a linear interpolation you need less points on your table less cache miss


order fit lower
whether splines or linear trapezodial interpolation is a better fit will depend heavily on your problem

with a lower order splines that works better but then you lose the advantage of cubic interpolation


mousemove	mouseup---------------------------------------------------

others
how can i change the handler so it only fires when the distance of mousemove between mousedown and mouseup is less than a fixed value


rtf	odf---------------------------------------------------

others
is html better than odf as a templating markup for generating emails letters documentation for rtf pdf


infobox	infowindow---------------------------------------------------

others
is there any way to change infowindow with infobox becouse i need more styling than basic infowindows.

if you want to get more out of infowindow and put html content in them i would recommend trying infobox


asihttprequest	cfnetwork---------------------------------------------------

others
you can use asihttprequest which is quite better than cfnetwork


median	percentile---------------------------------------------------

others
in the end i will add a band that displays 25th - 75th percentile but i figured working with the median would be simpler first

as one good programmer can be more productive than two average programmers i vaguely remember an old ibm study concluding someone in the top percentile was 27x more productive than median it s useful to see the same programmers doing it both ways


solaris	bsd---------------------------------------------------

others
and platform-specific solutions as kqueue bsd macosx epoll linux dev poll solaris are better if relatively small subset of all descriptors is ready on each cycle

my case in particular is with solaris servers but generic unix bsd tools are more than welcome

bsd find and gnu find but not solaris find support better units than just c for characters bytes


phpunit	codeception---------------------------------------------------

others
1 split those tests to unit and acceptance and use a tool like codeception to help you do acceptance which is way more elegant than phpunit for this kind of test


libjpeg	cimg---------------------------------------------------

others
using libjpeg inside cimg is definitely better


piston	tastypie---------------------------------------------------

query luck similar
edit i found out that piston was proposing query throttling but everywhere people say that tastypie is better than piston

- similar to piston but i ve had better luck with tastypie


others
i recommend to take a look on tastypie which turned out to work even nicer than piston it helps you also with things like versioning your api and mamange multiple endpoints nicly

tastypie is more tightly coupled to the orm than piston but there are methods that you can define in a tastypie resource to specify how to handle create read update delete


gunicorn	waitress---------------------------------------------------

others
i use windows on my pc to tinker around so decided on using waitress but perhaps gunicorn would be easier


wav	ogg---------------------------------------------------

others
it is even slower since i could only upload wav which is way bigger in size compared with ogg and opus

but better ogg than wav


compressive codec likely
it is likely that wav is using a more compressive codec such as mp3 or ogg internally

it is a high level 2d and 3d cross platform windows mac os x linux sound engine and audio library which plays wav mp3 ogg flac mod xm it s3m and more file formats and is usable in c++ and all .net languages c# visualbasic.net etc


woocommerce	shortcode---------------------------------------------------

others
woocommerce recommends creating a custom variable but i would imagine building a shortcode would be easier to deal with


capitalization	uppercase---------------------------------------------------

others
i would make the conditions easier by ignoring capitalization by converting to uppercase before comparison and leading trailing whitespace by using the strip method


bitarray	bitvector---------------------------------------------------

others
you will probably find that bitvector performs a good deal better than bitarray

why is the bitvector 32 structure more efficient than bitarray


ord	unpack---------------------------------------------------

others
unpack will be more efficient than split and ord because it doesn t have to make a bunch of temporary 1-character strings


png	ico---------------------------------------------------

others
however ico files if stored properly are not significantly larger than png files because since windows vista ico files can store png

i recommend use .ico format because the png don t work with method 1 and ico could have more detail


css gif scss
jpg jpeg bmp png webp gif svg js map ico css less scss

because i m new in react and server-side rendering at all i want to know if there are any standard ways to fix this problem - not images only i use images png jpeg jpg ico svg sass less css


powermock	jacoco---------------------------------------------------

others
on other cases earlier versions of powermock already worked with earlier versions of jacoco using offline instrumentation


mockito	scalamock---------------------------------------------------

others
mockito has been around a lot longer than scalamock and is much more actively maintained because of it s much larger contributor base

scalamock looks more natural when developing applications in scala however from what i read it seems to support fewer test scenarios compared to mockito and it s also less mature


bash	subshell---------------------------------------------------

others
running with debug option -x seems to imply that command substitution is similar to subshell since bash outputs a deeper nesting for it

moreover because read is built into bash and this usage requires no subshell it s significantly more efficient than approaches involving subprocesses such as head or awk

when working in bash it is generally more efficient and better suited to use the tools that bash provides rather than spawning subshell calling 3rd party tools like grep and cut


curb	libcurl---------------------------------------------------

others
that s much easier with a libcurl wrapper like curb like the tin man suggested than dropping to the shell and using libcurl there


phong	shading---------------------------------------------------

others
phong is a more nuanced shading model albeit a more hacky one which says that light is composed of ambient + diffuse + specular components


currentculture	uiculture---------------------------------------------------

others
i have a clue to the answer may be currentculture is for a broader class of language en and uiculture is for more specific variant of the language like en-us but am not sure if this is true


tinyxml	xerces---------------------------------------------------

others
for more complex xml reading writing you better check xerces which is heavier than tinyxml


gson	xstream---------------------------------------------------

others
gson is more about json-based persistence in the vein of xstream which can do json too and sounds a bit too heavyweight for just an applet


tensorflow	cudnn---------------------------------------------------

others
currently tensorflow supports the older cudnn v.5.1 while there is a newer cudnn 6.0 available on nvidia site


required	placeholder---------------------------------------------------

others
in such a case passing by value may no required actually passing anything at all -- the value that s passed is basically little or nothing more than a placeholder for this is the object

this is clearer and simpler no need to know what std bind does or what the std placeholder are for more flexible it can support any expression not just parameter binding required no support headers and will probably compile a little faster too


db4o	eloquera---------------------------------------------------

others
i think that eloquera www.eloquera.com is better than db4o and additionally has better licensing


persian	farsi---------------------------------------------------

others
in persian it s better to say farsi a decimal number like 32.98 is written 32 98 slash is used instead of point


pygobject	gio---------------------------------------------------

others
pygobject is nothing more than a thin layer of glue making gobject gio .


printf	strlen---------------------------------------------------

others
strlen is fast alloca is fast copying the string up to the first n is fast puts is faster than printf but is is most likely far slower than all three operations mentioned before together

on the other hand functions like printf or puts have more overhead per call than putc printf has to process the format string and puts has to call strlen or equivalent but that overhead only happens once no matter how many bytes you re writing


fortify	veracode---------------------------------------------------

others
though it has a couple of rules that check for specific security issues it s far less advanced than veracode coverity or fortify in this respect


h.265	webm---------------------------------------------------

others
if you strive to use h.265 to embed better quality video in your web content you should also consider transcoding and including webm


perforce	svn---------------------------------------------------

others
if you have the money ericgorr is right perforce is much nicer to work with then svn

if anything i find working with svn easier and more intuitive than perforce

since perforce is less commonly used compared to cvs svn amongst bamboo users we generally get less feedback about it and hear less about existing issues

perforce does have support for many other oses but our non-windows devs feel more comfortable with svn too

perforce offers more advanced branching and merging capabilities than svn

if you want to a little bit further you can imagine use more powerfull scm clearcase perforce ... but maven integration is fewer not well documented and community provide less examples than svn or git

and if you just want something faster or more scalable than svn then just buy a commercial product - i ve used both perforce and rational clearcase and they scale up to huge projects without any problems

while perforce is great svn git are more than ok free and widely supported


tortoise checkout git
the tortoise- svn git merge tools or that of perforce are way better here

perforce is soooo much faster than svn because all the check-outs are stored on the server so it doesn t have to check every file on an update

svn works much better when disconnected from the network - with perforce you have to tell the server when you ve done a checkout


onclicklistener	onitemclicklistener---------------------------------------------------

others
instead of using onclicklistener though it uses a class called onitemclicklistener which is more advantageous for using with listview

if you still would love to manage onclicklistener i will tell why onitemclicklistener is much better than onclicklistener

is using onclicklistener in arrayadapter worse than onitemclicklistener


charts	pie-chart---------------------------------------------------

others
if you want to do a split slice operation on a pie charts first you need to create a pie charts with slices.here from what i understand you tried to give the option split charts first which actually is to make differrent pie charts in the same row or column which needs more than one pie-chart

if h is larger than your pie-chart radius you are placing the label outside the charts you should consider a constant r for that with a nice looking line


oledbcommand	sqlcommand---------------------------------------------------

others
as shown in sample below for sqlcommand which is more or less same as oledbcommand


ng-switch	ng-show---------------------------------------------------

others
note that some people feel that ng-show is a little faster than ng-switch and ng-if for file-based templates


gtk	xcb---------------------------------------------------

others
you might use a low level x11 library like xcb -or the older xlib - it is used by graphical toolkits like qt or gtk or fox etc.. which are both free software toolkits so you could study their source code and xlib xcb are also free software


arp	icmp---------------------------------------------------

others
in addition seeing arp being slower than icmp doesn t necessarily mean icmp isn t deprioritized---it might mean bandwidth is insufficient to hit the limiting threshold


oncreate	findviewbyid---------------------------------------------------

others
this is better than normal findviewbyid because the views are create on compilation and are injected automatically inside the activity at oncreate being way more efficient than your standard initialization

you can t findviewbyid earlier than oncreate


mapguide	arcmap---------------------------------------------------

others
i mostly work with esri software though i ve had a little bit of work with mapguide mostly for clients whose engineering departments are using cad more than arcmap


matplotlib	chaco---------------------------------------------------

others
matplotlib wx will work but if you are going to be doing more of this sort of thing i found that chaco was a better solution for interaction

i m not sure if i m approaching this the right way or if i should be looking at another graphing module but i ve looked at gnuplot and chaco and i felt that matplotlib was more fit for my problem

enthought-dev is chaco faster than matplotlib


phpstorm	webstorm---------------------------------------------------

others
webstorm + pycharm + rubymine + phpstorm though to be fair rubymine has more features than radrails atm

however i do not know if webstorm has a comparable option like that as it has less functionality than phpstorm or even intellij


accessor	properties---------------------------------------------------

faster high self
edit as willeke has pointed out accessing a properties directly is technically faster than doing so via an accessor via self

in addition to what s already been said about threadsafeness non-atomic properties are faster than atomic accessor

will properties be any slower than the above accessor functions in a high performance application


better needs implementation
if it s only an accessor getter giving back some data than a properties fits better

however if you have special needs regarding properties such as specific get accessor implementation needs then better define a function which gets the value as you need it

even if you need access to the list via a static accessor you are better having a static properties on the same class which you re using to read the db

for simple accessor like these properties syntax is better than methods


restrictive modifier indexer
the accessibility level on the accessor must be more restrictive than the accessibility level on the properties

accessor must be more restrictive than the properties or indexer

you only need to specify a private access modifier for your set accessor when the properties is more accessible

any restrictions placed on an individual accessor must be more restrictive than the accessibility level of the properties itself not less

error 26 the accessibility modifier of the myeventsource.listener.set accessor must be more restrictive than the properties or indexer myeventsource.listener

the accessibility modifier of the abstractpolygon.polygon.length.set accessor must be more restrictive than the properties or indexer abstractpolygon.polygon.length

auto-properties can have different accessibilities for setter and getter by specifying a more restrictive accessibility for the accessor for which the accessibility differs from the properties s accessibility

the accessibility modifier of the accessor must be more restrictive than the properties connection1.connectionstring

the accessibility modifier of the arp_tll.dataaccess.chromosomeaddedeventargs.newchromosome.set accessor must be more restrictive than the properties or indexer arp_tll.dataaccess.chromosomeaddedeventargs.newchromosome

if you want to specify extra accessibility level keyword you can only do it on one of the accessor getter setter and that level of the accessor must be more restrictive than the accessibility of the entire properties

note that i m caching the length value as the array s length properties is actually an accessor which is marginally slower than an internal variable

i know of the error the accessibility modifier of the set accessor must be more restrictive than the properties or indexer

accessor must be more restrictive than the properties .

this too won t compile error the accessibility modifier of the usercontrol1.controls.set accessor must be more restrictive than the properties or indexer usercontrol1.controls

error 11 the accessibility modifier of the framework.oracleprovider.db.set accessor must be more restrictive than the properties or indexer framework.oracleprovider.db

i am trying to fix it with this accessor must be more restrictive than the properties or indexer but in my case the main problem is get not set i try to change get into public but still get this error

the following code errors telling me that the accessor must be more restrictive than the properties and that i can t specify modifiers for bother accessor

error the accessibility modifier of the set accessor must be more restrictive than the properties or indexer and why is internal protected not more restrictive than internal


methods pair aspect
it means a declared properties is more than a pair of accessor methods getter setter

that suggests another aspect where a declared properties is more than a pair of accessor methods that is more static type checking although it is undesirable here


others
i would assume that properties where additional operations are performed in the accessor are harder for the compiler to optimize and that those that only modify a backing field are more likely to be optimized but would like some more concrete rules

if an ivar is going to be changed frequently declaring a properties and always using the accessor will make it easier to avoid memory management errors

properties just offer a nicer syntax for getter and setter aka accessor and indeed a properties just wraps set and get methods under the hood

using the properties and the accessor allows for more flexibility for example key-value-observing is only possible using the accessor

you can use the accessor annotation to specify a method to be used when serializing a properties which is a cleaner way of doing it

you can use optional properties with the accessor defined lower to make that simpler

data is not an accessor for properties it s both more and less than that

if you need getter and setter to expose some instance variables or you want some automatic retain release memory management or thread safe accessor then properties are a less verbose way to automatically create these smart getter and setter

in some situations the set accessor for a properties can have more restricted access than the get accessor

nonatomic properties don t use locks but direct ivar is faster because it skips the accessor call

there s not much to recommend one over the other except that the direct ivar access is slightly faster the properties version creates a temporary array and sends an accessor message to make the new condition create its copy of that array

my guess is that iphone tutorials use properties to make it easier for new developers to jump through memory management even though it s handy to generate appropriate accessor with properties rather than implement them by hand every time

properties just made it easier to write accessor

a properties is nothing more than syntactic shorthand for a get set accessor

will emitting opcode.call for the static properties s accessor have poorer performance than ldsfld bear in mind this is across tens of thousands of invocations since every method in the assembly is woven


info.plist	ipa---------------------------------------------------

others
we are having an issue with uploading ipa files to our mdm solution when there is more than one info.plist present in the ipa file


domxpath	domdocument---------------------------------------------------

others
you re better off with domdocument s loadhtml and domxpath

for this kind of task reading the document into a domdocument and using domxpath is probably more suitable


visualvm	jfr---------------------------------------------------

others
they attach to a running jvm process and allow for thread snapshots and various other kinds of diagnosis visualvm has a lot of available plugins but that can take awhile to sort through to configure and understand if you want to go beyond default behavior whereas jfr is instrumented with more by default


dplyr	purrr---------------------------------------------------

others
with library purrr you can have a prettier more compact form see soto s answer for an even more compact one with dplyr

note that while you could use purrr for the job it s not particularly better suited than regular dplyr


prepare	pdostatement---------------------------------------------------

others
more than likely prepare failed and is false instead on a pdostatement object


openni	kinect---------------------------------------------------

others
another camera that i am thinking to use is the asus movement sensor but i dont know if this is better than kinect more options i know that both uses openni or if both are the same


range	infinity---------------------------------------------------

others
in the default to-nearest rounding mode the mathematical result of the addition would have to be above the middle point between double.maxvalue and the next floating-point value that could be represented if the exponent range was wider for the floating-point result to round up to infinity

in python3 range can go much higher though not to infinity

splines interpolation is probably more useful for you than polynomial interpolation if you fit a polynomial it must inevitably head off to + - infinity outside your data range


mouseup	mousedown---------------------------------------------------

others
when testing both cases it seems that mouseup events are slower and less reliable sometimes the button press is missed or the screen hangs slightly before responding than mousedown

as you ve already done you can set a date on mousedown and do stuff until mouseup then do something more based on how long the button was held down for hopefully the following is self explanatory

something like if mousedown position is more than 10px away from mouseup position

logic to handle enter + mouse click is placed on keydown and mousedown it could be moved to keyup and mouseup if makes more sense


faster better
is there any reason mousedown should be inherently faster better than mouseup

first off consider whether you really want to override mousedown or whether overriding mouseup might be a better option


coffeescript	livescript---------------------------------------------------

others
coco and livescript on npm or github both are derived from coffeescript and are more space sensitive which allows you to do


appealing syntax compatible
livescript derived from coco which itself was derived from coffeescript it has the more appealing syntax to me it even has my beloved pipeline | operator from f#

livescript is coco but much more compatible with coffeescript more functional and more feature rich


xlsb	xlsm---------------------------------------------------

others
but i heard that xlsb loads way faster than xlsm so i would not like to change the fileformat


super	extends---------------------------------------------------

lower upper
where extends is an upper bound super is a lower bound

super is a lower bound and extends is an upper bound


others
also if all your classes extends class super it s better to write instead of raw class

here the content for the length item is this is a super duper long snippet because we need to see how labels behave when they more than barely extends onto multiple lines. the content for the power cycle item is have you tried turning it off and back on again

no java prevents a class from directly extends more than one super class

it s useful to know that extends bound is much more common than super


subset-sum	np-complete---------------------------------------------------

others
the subset-sum problem is hard more precisely it s np-complete which means that your variant is hard too it s not np-complete because it s not a decision problem but it is np-hard


jscrollpane	jviewport---------------------------------------------------

others
even when it s bigger than my jscrollpane s jviewport the knobs will not appear on the scroll bars and i cannot scroll down on the canvas


snappy	lz4---------------------------------------------------

others
lz4 is probably better though snappy was developed by google with protobufs in mind so you might want to test both on your data set.


maven-shade-plugin	appassembler---------------------------------------------------

others
for the uber-jar applications i use maven-shade-plugin for merging jars into one + proguard for shrinking but appassembler is much quicker and stable to use


crypt	salt---------------------------------------------------

others
so when i see that the salt is stored in the hash password and that you use that hash password as salt i think crypt + salt is not more secure against a brute force on output hackers who managed to steal hash passwords

that accepts either nothing a salt or a hash that crypt made earlier which has the salt to make the hash embedded in it


updatepanel	scriptmanager---------------------------------------------------

others
i have found that using jquery javascript inside an updatepanel is more hassel than it is worth as you always need to output the jquery javascript using the scriptmanager or the scriptmanager.registerclientscriptblock

in case if updatepanel takes more time to process set asyncpostbacktimeout property of your scriptmanager

if you are more comfortable with updatepanel these should still work if you have everything inside a form tag and a scriptmanager within the form tag too


typhoeus	curb---------------------------------------------------

others
instead of net http i can use httparty curb rest client or typhoeus which makes everything easier but i can t find any similar solutions to replace enhance net ftp


subtraction	addition---------------------------------------------------

others
re-order your script so the subtraction test is timed first then the addition and suddenly addition becomes the faster operation again

strict addition is rare but subtraction is more common like when you subtract one image from its filtered one

the subtraction case is going to require a little more work than addition in this code

of course the relative overhead will be smaller for functions that do more work than one addition and one subtraction per iteration

a111 addition is equal or better than subtraction


result bits lower
i was thinking that there could be an issue if the result from the addition is bigger than what 15 bits can represent 32767 or if i get a negative number in the subtraction

by the way the result of this addition taking its lower 8 bits discarding the carry bit is the result of the original subtraction


multiplication simple powers
the operations are always algebraically simple never involving anything more than addition multiplication subtraction division and taking powers

apart from that multiplication is addition done more than once and division is subtraction done more than once

the only way it would be broken up differently would be if addition had a higher precedence than subtraction like multiplication does


slower logic level
division is performed by repeated subtraction therefore needs more level of subtract logic making division slower than addition

it s possible though that software could mess things up by making subtraction slower than addition - but that s unlikely

this is a hold over from older compilers and interpreters on old chip architecture that would do addition slightly slower than subtraction

since addition can be faster then subtraction we add the offset instead of subtract it from 31

but i d think bignum subtraction is a little slower than bignum addition

here it is conceivable that subtraction is slower than addition


fread	read.table---------------------------------------------------

others
you might want to give the data.table package a try check out the fread function which is much faster than read.table

interestingly for 1 million rows per file the optimised version of read.csv and read.table take 422 and 430 more time than fread whilst without optimisation this leaps to around 1500 and 1005 longer


errors better base
fread ... is extremely fast 10 - 100 times faster than read.table ... or read.csv ... for large datasets

instead of the conventional read.table i feel fread is a faster function

for this data.table fread would be better than the standard read.table

for reading large csv files you should either use readr read_csv or data.table fread as both are much faster than base read.table

fread performs faster and more efficiently than read.table but read.table produces less no errors on the same data set


scrolltop	removeclass---------------------------------------------------

others
i want to removeclass when scrolltop is more then 200px

i can t seem to figure out why removeclass doesn t work when my scrolltop is less than or not equal to my nav s offset .top value


amd	umd---------------------------------------------------

others
umd is even better supported since it is compatible with commonjs and amd so that would be a safer bet


pyquery	lxml.html---------------------------------------------------

others
there is a project pyquery that is much faster as it uses lxml.html library speed comparasion can be found here


unix	aix---------------------------------------------------

others
nawk alas aix don t have sort and unix sort is far more superior then any hand-made sort in awk

it is compiled on windows and unix systems including somewhat more exotic platforms like aix zlinux solaris and hpux


gulp-sass	gulp-ruby-sass---------------------------------------------------

plugin features rich
but the plugin gulp-ruby-sass slower than gulp-sass

i ended up using gulp-ruby-sass that while is a bit slower than gulp-sass is rich with features such as loadpath


others

rank	percentile---------------------------------------------------

others
i m thinking that this is just happening at a larger scale with your percentile since you re basically condensing their rank into a 1 to 100 scale

since ntile might put the same number in more than one percentile i use a query to calculate the percentile using rank


innodb	tokudb---------------------------------------------------

others
i use tokudb on tables of up to 18 billion rows and nothing else comes close it s at least 100 times faster than innodb for random inserts on big tables


slower performance usage
from my personal use i experienced about 5 - 10 times less disk usage due to tokudb s compression and it s much much faster than myisam or innodb

at the beginning the insert performance of innodb is almost 50 times slower than myisam and tokudb is 40 times slower than myisam


audiotoolbox	avfoundation---------------------------------------------------

others
can someone if i should use the avfoundation or whether the audiotoolbox library is better


opengl-es	glreadpixels---------------------------------------------------

others
take a look at the gpuimagefilter class for how i extract images from an opengl-es frame including a faster method using texture caches instead of glreadpixels


xstream	jdom---------------------------------------------------

others
i already create the xml for some beans inside the larger bean with xstream and append them as elements to the jdom


or-operator	and-operator---------------------------------------------------

others
which will never be true have in mind that the and-operator binds stronger than the or-operator

as far as i know the and-operator has the higher precedence than || or-operator in most of the languages


bmp	png---------------------------------------------------

others
note that the png format is much more complex than bmp since it allows compression etc

working with a png as opposed to say a bitmap bmp is made somewhat more difficult by the fact that gdi does not natively support pngs

is not simple scale or crop but to be able to rotate scale and crop every single sprite and draw it in the exactly order to compose the final hight resolution image in a backbuffer then save it in bmp and make some copies in lower resolution as png

i haven t worked with any more than jpg png and gif so there might be some more image types out there that can fit into this function bmp

i feel like if the bitmap class makes data modifications to the stream then it would have to decompress the stream which should make the bitmap class take the same amount of memory working with bmp streams as when it works with png streams despite the fact that the png streams is smaller

not only do png files have natural support for transparency they are also smaller than bmp files

using imagemagick or graphicsmagick would be better idea but if you really want to use sips you could try to remove transparency by converting image to bmp and then back to png again

rebuild a new png format in-memory data which is much more smaller than current bmp data and send the new png format data by socket to remote server


slower faster
i have a sample wpf app here and wondering why bmp is loading faster than png

jpg png is slower to draw than a bmp


vmware	esx---------------------------------------------------

others
edit we use vmware here and the reason we can t use real keys is that our esx servers are running more vms than they have real usb ports and sharing is not acceptible


entity-relationship-model	relational-model---------------------------------------------------

others
while relational-model can express any finite set of facts since it s equivalent to first-order logic the entity-relationship-model is more limited


joomla	typo3---------------------------------------------------

others
i didn t work with these applications yet but afaik typo3 and ezpublish both php are considered much more professional than joomla


menhir	ocamlyacc---------------------------------------------------

others
this is actually the syntax of ocamlyacc which you should not use if you start a new project in that case you should use menhir which has a more readable syntax and is better for numerous other reasons


opensuse	linux---------------------------------------------------

others
i have used a lot more than 10 linux distributions and i now stick to opensuse


bitblt	gdi---------------------------------------------------

others
the thing is that gdi is still faster than direct2d if i draw to a bitmap and after it s done i bitblt the result back to the form it paints at 35ms and with the same graphics quality

when drawing images i found the native bitblt to perform alot better than using .net graphics you could use it to display your bitmap or even use gdi to create the bitmap instead


subplot	imshow---------------------------------------------------

others
any ideas what might be causing this how i could fix it or how i could get around it to use matshow or imshow on a specified subplot the end use case is to have more than 1 subplot in the figure


mp3	m3u---------------------------------------------------

others
an m3u file is nothing more than a text file listing mp3 and or other format digital audio files to be interpreted by player software as a series of audio files to be played in succession


hex	binary---------------------------------------------------

memory template command
- i usually find debugging memory in hex x command is easier than binary so i will not use my solution

the results of running a binary template are much easier to understand and edit than using just the raw hex bytes


decimal conversion octal
that s one reason why going from hex to binary is much easier than from decimal to binary

the conversion from hex to binary is even simpler since you can simply expand each hex digit into the corresponding binary for example 0xa4 - 1010 0100

this is still accepted by calls like inet_addr and has several advantages all fields are fixed width there are only 8 characters to update and the binary to hex conversion is usually faster than binary to decimal

hex is just less verbose and can express anything a binary number can

i have made it so that the binary properly converts to base ten decimal and the decimal properly converts to hex but it only works if the binary number is less than 5 digits 01101 correctly turns out 16 and 11111 turns 1f but something like 11010110 stupidly becomes 6 here s my code

one important reason is because hex is alot shorter and easier to read than binary is for humans

you ll see converting from binary to hex is much more straightforward than from decimal to hex for instance

converting between decimal and hex is more involving and at least to me it s been easier if i have to do it in my head to first convert the decimal into binary representation and then the binary number into hex

as others have pointed out hex is much more convenient than binary anyway - you just need to remember how each of the hex digit 0-f looks in binary and replace groups of 4 bits with a single hex digit

but when anyone human looks at it they look at it in hex using a hex editor which is much easier than reading binary

so i m wondering if anyone knows of a way i could implement either a floating-point to binary digits function or better yet floating-point to hex

with a little practice hex or octal are easier for a human than binary

hex and octal are just shorter ways to write binary

generally hex values are preferred over decimal values as the conversion to binary from hex involves less computation than the conversion from decimal

it seems the from a readability and usability standpoint the hex representation is a better way of defining binary numbers

the conversion between binary and either octal or hex is even easier than decimal


others
unfortunately using hex consumes way more space and takes significantly longer i m dealing with 500gb of data and around 1 2 million records so i would really like to get the straight binary method to work

if the right side the binary side is greater than or equal to the hex side then you print true if not then you print false

hex is easier for most people to convert to and from binary in their heads since binary numbers are usually expressed in blocks of eight because that s the size of a byte and eight is exactly two hex digits but hex notation would have been clunky and misleading in dennis time implying the ability to address 16 bits

if the 4 bits are greater than 1001 binary 9 decimal then you want to interpret that as a not-valid number and i guess ff hex is to be interpreted as a blank space

a hex string is significantly longer than the corresponding binary string

if we use hex because it s a simplification of binary that makes things easier on the programmer is easier to read than binary and carries more data etc. why do we not jump to the next logical step base64

base64 is usually used in instances to represent arbitrary binary data in a text format it has a 33.3 overhead but that s better than say hex notation which has a 50 overhead

originally i was looking for a binary display but this hex display is much better for viewing

format_int in binary case it loops 4 times then 4 times more than hex and dec cases

hex encoding is far more readable than binary that s why sublime uses it

those hex values seem a bit odd they re powers of two in decimal but in any case 0x128 the 0x is a standard prefix for hex numbers is the larger of the numbers in magnitude and its binary representation is 100101000


data useful program
binary data is typically represented in hex to make it easier to read and reference

hex is somewhat more readable than binary if i happen to be loading a data dump in a text editor etc

my program reads from binary data and i am just displaying it in hex to make it simpler

and because hex is much more readable and useful than binary - it s often used and shown


editors editing computer
i ve been using images to store data since editing binary data through paint.net is much friendlier than most hex editors

hex editors are more of a tool for geeks as they also give you the computer data in hex a more readable format compared to binary


quad	uniform---------------------------------------------------

others
then either use a shader with a uniform to select which corner of the texture to display or else make a quad for each corner with pre baked uvs to select which part of the video to display


karatsuba	strassen---------------------------------------------------

others
i think karatsuba algorithm is best to perform arithmetic operations on large numbers.for sufficiently large n another generalization the schã nhageâ strassen algorithm is even faster


helpers	actioncontroller---------------------------------------------------

others
actionlink helpers is more often used to generate url properly based on the actioncontroller route values etc and anchor tag based on htmlattributes etc


jqgrid	datatables---------------------------------------------------

customisation someone better
it turns out jquery datatables is better suited for customisation and we have adopted this instead of using jqgrid

if you don t have someone around to help with jqgrid you are better off with datatables


others
datatables such as datatables.net and jqgrid are more for displaying tabular data than inline editing in the same style as excel

datatables has better customizations as far as clientside bells and whistles where as jqgrid is a little harder to make look as pretty but can do some pretty good serverside interaction from what i understand


jrebel	hotswap---------------------------------------------------

others
it is worth mentioning that there is a commercial product named jrebel that is much more powerful than jvm hotswap


floyd-warshall	dijkstra---------------------------------------------------

better complexity v
the floyd-warshall algorithm has a worst case performance of o |v| 3 where as dijkstra s has a worse case performance of o |e| + |v|log |v|

the floyd-warshall algorithm has a worst case performance of o |v|3 where as dijkstra s has a worse case performance of o |e| + |v|log |v|

indeed floyd-warshall s algorithm is better than dijkstra s in this case the complexity for dijkstra is o m n 2 and in this problem m is much much higher than n so the o n 3 time complexity of floyd-warshall is better


others
short answer floyd-warshall is more efficient in this case than naive application of dijkstra s

short answer dijkstra s is your best bet if you want just a few shortest paths and the floyd-warshall algorithm is better if you want to find the shortest paths between every pair of nodes

no practically floyd-warshall is faster than dijkstra s for all pair shortest path generally


scrollable	panels---------------------------------------------------

others
when the contents of the panels are bigger than its clientsize then autoscrollminsize should be equivalent to the scrollable area of the panels


autoscroll jpanel form
the panels itself is larger than the form and is scrollable autoscroll true

i am trying to create a jpanel that is resizable scrollable and contains x smaller inner panels


for-loop	arrays---------------------------------------------------

others
however the aim of this answer is to give you a modern approach for writing the same code using the std vector and the range-based for-loop since you are in the beginning of your learning process try as much as you can to avoid c-style arrays and learn more about the stl containers

note that a for-loop with a pre-allocated result arrays will be more performant

if your logic is calling for calculating totals of 4 consecutive elements of the arrays then your for-loop should stop earlier

this is a scenario where a traditional for-loop is more handy than just iterating over the arrays

to my knowledge and research so far - javascript s native for-loop is quicker than arrays map for iterating through the arrays

the problem is if i jump over that value which is negative with my while loops to get the higher k i will have to pass the same k in my for-loop which i don t want to because i already got it in my arrays

if you wanted to split the contents of the input arrays into multiple output arrays you could do that with .reduce by encapsulating all of them as properties of a single object but .foreach or the for-loop would look more natural to me

now the problem i am having is that one this model is called in side a for-loop thus i can get back many of these arrays each of these arrays is tied to a different user and two each arrays can have more then two arrays inside of it in fact some of the arrays that come back can have up to 40

next i can use 3rd 4th and 5th level of arrays means more than for-loop statement will be assign

when i read the question verilog for-loop for arrays multiplication became clearer how to operate but i can not see how to manage it to be entered into memory

an arrays usually offers more information for alias analysis and after some optimizations the same code will be generated anyway search for-loop strength reduction if curious

the few instructions you can run concurrently the for-loop and a couple of operations on the morton code arrays are much cheaper than un locking a mutex even using an atomic increment if available would be more expensive than the un-synchronized part

notice that i have added a check in the for-loop that will make sure you don t create an infinite loops by requesting more unique items than the arrimgs arrays can provide

if you have only a handful of items in the original arrays say less than 16 then you can also count from 0 to 2 n -1 in a for-loop

i ve tried using more than 1 for-loop and to zip the files using an arrays but to no avail

i ve used it for convenience a for-loop is much more reliable for converting an htmlcollection to an arrays

but the outer for-loop still runs 9 more times pushing temp which is already a set number onto the numbers arrays

a for-loop is more adequate than a do while for simply iterating an arrays string

this changes the variable curve so that it now points to the middle of the arrays that was previously initialized so that the follow-on for-loop indexing is likely easier for the programmer to think about and a bit cleaner to write debug etc

now i want to read each line from my table one by one and store the result into a arrays and i am trying to use a for-loop to be more professional rather then using repetition

you can give an arrays which have higher count as data source to tableview then you can use for-loop in cellforrowatindexpath to check the values are matching or not

the for-loop just initializes the arrays which that each slot in the arrays is .211 higher than the one before it

in such a simple arrays you shouldn t be concerned about memory usage but the for-loop consumes less memory than foreach because foreach uses an internal copy of the arrays

it is clear without any performance tests that native javascript for-loop is faster but there is no big difference for small arrays like 10-20 small items

the for-loop will take too long if my arrays has more than 100 items

i think that use max reduction clause to find the max element of an arrays is not such a bad idea but in fact the parallel for-loop ran much slower than serial one

some kind of followup to my last question for-loop - move deeper on numeric key in multidimensional arrays

the below code works but i would like to automate the process with a for-loop or another method so i can repeat the same process on arrays that are much longer

i believe you want to move it into for-loop to get more random numbers in your arrays

one thing that is wrong is that you have maxstudents set to 200 you allocate the studentnames arrays with size 200 but that means that the valid subscripts are 0 through 199 but your for-loop uses a less than or equal test against 200

but there have been a few cases where i need to iterate and the arrays helpers are less intuitive and more cumbersome than the for-loop

on the last iteration of the outer for-loop ndx is one less than array.length so when you call arrays ndx+1 that is equivalent to arrays array.length which out of bounds since arrays start indexing at 0

my brain just woke up i have realized i just need to make an arrays in order of the way i want the data to be saved in the text file and changed the for-loop to be less complex

the for-loop runs for 10 iterations and the last character is not inserted in the input arrays because of which the standart character count in input arrays is coming one less than expected 2

in your code on line in the for-loop does no more point to an arrays --the compiler has no information about the length of the variable that it s pointing at whether it is an arrays a single chars or an int or something else-- but it is just a plain pointer presumably a pointer pointing to a default int

specifically i m trying to store some information acquired in the for-loop in a different arrays i think there s a more efficient way to do this but we haven t covered more than single-dimensional arrays in class yet so no matter at a parallel index as the current interation

try catch inside for-loop is probably closer as long as you don t mind the unassigned values left in the arrays

what is even better is oleksiy s solution because surprisingly .foreach method uses less memory than classic for-loop so if you re optimisation freak use .foreach but after all it doesn t matter because your arrays size is small so you won t notice any speed difference

so first i tried with nsattributedstring when i received an arrays from service i used for-loop and added one more key with attributedstring and then i displayed it

a for-loop is more suitable to iterate through the arrays

so i am using the music graph api to access and display artists similar to the current one in this case the who. however when i use a for-loop to go through the results .text artistnames only prints the last name in the arrays in this case it only prints pink floyd even though the arrays contains more artists. however console.log prints every name in the arrays

a straightforward solution is to iteratively create each of the arrays using a for-loop or list comprehension or use a higher dimensional arrays where each of these 1d arrays is a row in your 2d arrays which is generally faster

i m working in matlab in which nested for-loop is used to collect data and store in cell arrays however i want to collect data and the inner loops is collect further in the same cell arrays according to its position

so when you go up an arrays 0-9 you want the top of a for-loop to be less than the arrays length when you are going down the arrays 9-0 you want the lower bound to be less than or equal to the bottom of the arrays otherwise you will start out trying to access at 10 the arrays length and get an outofrangeexception

what you probably want to do shorten the for-loop to be more concise especially when you already have an arrays or iterator

you can do the whole job in a single for-loop reading from stdin look if it is larger than the max smaller than the min and so you do not need the arrays


last anarray part
i have a json arrays wherer i would like to pasre the json till the last element by using for-loop for that i would like to get the number of arrays elements in the json arrays i have more than 3 objects in anarray so i am confused how to parse the json till the last element

but the for-loop is not reading writing the last part of the parent file which is less than the arrays size


length index equal
it turns out i had a hard coded maximum index in my for-loop which was bigger than the arrays i was trying to assign to

the comparision in the for-loop to be less than the length not less than or equal to as this will trigger an off by oe error due to length being the count but the arrays being zero indexed

when i try to access it with a for-loop where its index is less than the arrays length i get the following error message typeerror function object is unsubscriptable

second in your for-loop you are checking the a arrays s length which would make the code break if the other arrays have more or less objects inside of them

because if the first word in arrays is shorter than second one you need second for-loop

i have an arrays of integer and i am trying to iterate back the for-loop to the last index it visited based on some condition lets say i have 2 9 15 19 23 28 37 elements in that loops i am giving a condition that if each element of that loops is greater than a number lets say 8 it will process that element again

however the for-loop ends when i equals the length of the arrays which gets shorter as values are removed

also change your logic in the for-loop to be not since i will not ever be greater than the arrays length

now you can walk your collection with a for-loop without fearing that one arrays is shorter than another one or even use a foreach loops to go through elements without using an index

i am trying to create a method that will step through an arrays with a for-loop and if they arrays subscript is greater than or equal to the minimum requirement a string arrays subscript will be added to a listbox

for sure this won t work this way since your arrays will have more than 100 entries but with a second for-loop outside the first one you should achieve what you re trying quite fast

or use the length of the data in the arrays which may be smaller than the arrays size and use a simple for-loop

however instead of using two nested for-loop you can use count arrays which is more efficient

because of this your for-loop should check if the index is less than the length of the arrays by using the less than operator instead of

it s slower than simple for-loop from 1 to arrays length and ipairs is deprecated in lua 5.2 anyway

i fixed this by adding after the for-loop and before the return statement which fixes the problem but if the for-loop is written to continue while i is less than the arrays length and when the arrays only contains a the length is one and i is 0 shouldn t it also pop a

i read in the data in a for-loop and create a bigger data set by inserting an arrays for the area points for each datapoint

that means it should be first merge and then create distinct values arrays without using more foreach for-loop

for-loop should run less than the length of the arrays not equal to and string should be replaced at the end of the for-loop

change that to a normal for-loop using a max of 5 or the size of the places arrays whichever is smaller

if the length of the arrays is less than 8 a regular for-loop summation is performed

the for-loop iterates from 0 to the length of arrays which equals longstring.length less 1

to use this in a loops you can write a simple for-loop which always checks if the index stil is smaller than the arrays length

above is a simplified version of my actual code where the c arrays is much larger so i have to use a for-loop to get every index

now i am using a for-loop to iterate over these frames and add 10 frames in prior and after the erroneous frames in order to get a sequence so that in the end the arrays is more populated

im going to have a second for-loop that makes more arrays and names these arrays as the strings from my previous arrays


bigger amount small
i suppose the first option is good for small arrays but a for-loop is probably better practice as the amount of code would remain the same regardless of arrays size

i ve found that for bigger arrays 100k elements it actually pays to simply iterate the arrays with a humble for-loop performing 30 better than math.max.apply

yeah i could do this the standard for-loop way but these arrays get bigger and the standard brute force way isn t good enough for me


long time entry
but i don t want to use a for-loop as my json arrays has more than 3 entries and if i request a lot of data in short time it takes long time till the for-loop goes through every entry

my arrays can contain more than 1000 object so the for-loop can run for a long time and generate a lot of strings

i am just starting to learn about the streams and parallel in java and i was wondering why a normal for-loop takes less time than intstream paralleled at adding items to an arrays


new faster replacements
running a quick benchmark it seems that the for-loop is 4x faster even in the worst case where you have to replace every single time and you construct a new arrays to hold the replacements

so i thought maybe deleting the entries in the interpolated time arrays would be faster instead of copying to a new matrix but when an entry gets deleted the interpolated time arrays changes size so this for-loop would cause it to access outside the matrix


coding straight efficient
the only way to copy arrays that is more efficient than for-loop coding is system.arraycopy

or if the arrays is a straight numerically indexed one you can use a for-loop which is more efficient


copying index new
an index-based for-loop might perform much better than an iterator since you can index the original arrays directly and avoid copying to a new arrays

note that you should check if index is within arrays bounds in such cases and that system.arraycopy is more efficient and arguably simpler than a for-loop for copying arrays

notice that besides using the filter method or not even with a plain for-loop is much better for performance create a new arrays from scratch instead of mutate the current one multiple times


temporary tuples in_array
the for-loop here is more efficient for 2 reasons a you don t have to construct a temporary arrays of tuples like with zip and b it returns false as soon as a non-match is found

if you use the values as keys in the arrays of things you want to skip checking for them in your for-loop should be more efficient than using in_array


loops element better
in this case if any element in arrays is shorter than 11 symbols will become big and for-loop will stop executing

i was considering whether some approach using arrays of function pointers so that initialisation is done in a for-loop might be better

the normal for-loop is useful when you don t want to visit every element in the arrays or if you have more than one loops variable

since it s an arrays it s better to use a for-loop with a counter variable i which starts from 1

as seen in this comparison using for-loop with counter set to the size of the arrays is significantly faster than for each loops

if the messages arrays contain more than one element you want a regular for-loop

then continue on to your for-loop so the flowesttemp will be at least the value of the first element if not lower if any subsequent arrays elements are lower

but for the arrays it is better to use for-loop as shown by alnitak than for-in

and also i don t want use for-loop because it would cause trouble if the arrays size becomes bigger

write a for-loop that loops through your arrays taking the integer value of each item and if it s less than min save it to min and if it s greater than max save it to max

first if you generically want to apply the same function to each element of an arrays and there isn t already a built in vectorized way to do it you could use arrayfun although often a simple for-loop is faster and more readable

this can be done in much better fashion by avoiding for-loop provided if you choose to change your arrays structure with predefined index some thing like var

in your for-loop you have given condition such that loops will execute only if the args arrays size is greater that 1

after that we make sure that the arrays contains at least two value to compare by starting the for-loop from 1 and make sure the size of the arrays is greater than 1 .if not we return the arrays as it is

also with the for-loop it s considered better to limit the scope of the iterating variable i and to use println you need system.out not just system and you need a string java arrays do not override tostring so something to output the numbers the user entered after loops like

after you finish reading from the user run a for-loop to check if the value of the arrays element is greater than 1 then you print it

but then normal for-loop is far better for arrays than using for-in which is actually for object

okay so after telling the user to enter the size of the arrays the arrays was assigned to lets say 5 therefore in the first for-loop the program is checking if i is less than the arrays size so it can only be entered 5 times as that is the size of the arrays

to avoid this problem a for-loop would be better since you already know the size of the arrays

due to your loops accessing the arrays element several times during each iteration in this example a foreach loops would be faster than a for-loop

if you insist on having the data in 2 arrays it is easier to iterate the arrays using a for-loop with an index instead of a foreach loops

i am using a for-loop which iterates i time and every time it is checked whether the ith number of the arrays is greater than 1 or not

while loops aren t normally used to iterate over arrays as for-loop syntax is less verbose and allows the sentinel variable i to fall out of scope while the for-loop syntax does not

i was trying to have each of these arrays sort_array added to a single multidimensional arrays by using a for-loop to have everything added to one arrays to make it easier to plot and export as a text file

if you just need to pass numbers and run a list of jobs with the same command except the input file number it s better to use a job arrays instead of a for-loop as job arrays would have less burden on the job scheduler

or if the pages arrays contain more than one element you want a regular for-loop

but when looping through an arrays it s better to use a regular for-loop

yes you can use the values of the arrays to specify the lower bound and upper bound values for the for-loop

you get the recursive formula from the inner for-loop that iterates over the arrays of primes lower than sqrt n approximated by sqrt n 1 2 â ln n and the work you have to do to come this far represented by t n-2

then we can simply use foreach for javascript arrays .its a simplest than for loop..but as per the research for-loop is faster than foreach ..this is one of the good explanation for that

but to loops through an arrays you re really better off with a regular for-loop

i use a for-loop and a boolean with an if clause to detect whether the arrays element is larger or smaller than the input and then add it all together and display it

in my opinion a for-loop would be easier than a foreach loops since you re using 2 arrays and a for-loop can give you an integer for an index to use for both

the for-loop should give you better perf when used on arrays

seems like a for-loop would be the better way to go here but if you think you must use foreach you could shift the first element off the arrays and unshift it back on

my view is that option 1 is clumsy code and involves unnecessary creation of an arrays even though the for-each loops is more efficient than the traditional for-loop in option 2

so you can access the arrays at any index between the range of 0 and array.length - 1 alas if you wanted to use a for in loops to iterate over an arrays you certainly can however a regular for-loop is more appropriate

the idea is that when all the values inside the arrays are greater than zero the for-loop breaks

if it s a very deep inner loops however and you need to squeak out every last nanosecond my experience has been that with release build code a for-loop indexing over an arrays is measurably faster than a foreach loops with a slightly smaller performance loss for using delegates with linq vs

i also changed the for-loop that you had there to foreach loops which makes more sense when working with arrays

so then i think to go with that approach i would end up with a for-loop and loads of add calls but surely that is even worse than the arrays copy isn t it

the questions should i use for-loop or is it better to do it recursively next insert will be called after previous is done should i check if saved.length datalength and then return the arrays or is there some better way how to do it

if the above is true doesn t this mean that the foreach loops is much slower then the common for-loop since it involves making copies of each element of the arrays

in its implementation foreach executes a closure over every element in the arrays this is typically more straightforward and transparent alternative to old-fashioned for-loop

i would predict that iterating over a traditional fixed-size arrays would be more efficient with a for-loop and dynamically allocated storage would be faster with the range-based loops

you can even shorten the for-loop by directly pushing the objects into the arrays which is a better way -

you should use a for-loop which is more convenient to loops in an arrays

instead of getting the length method to treat a single element statement as an arrays i think a better solution would be to use a foreach loops instead of a for-loop to iterate

in my opinion a for-loop is usually better for doing something a specific number of times and if you re just iterating over every item in an arrays foreach is usually more straightforward

you can use array.prototype.find method to check if the element exists in arrays which is much better than perform a traditional for-loop

and if it is o n 2 then how is it better than nested for-loop where i just compare each char with rest of the arrays

according to the answer of the foreach vs for-loop question assuming it s correct for loops on list are a bit more than 2 times cheaper than foreach loops on list and looping on arrays is around 2 times cheaper than looping on list

but you will have loops the outer arrays in order to get it to work which would be better done with a for-loop so you reference both at once

also a regular for-loop would be more appropriate since you re returning the same arrays element that came in


slower axis array.sum
.each is an internal iterator and i m pretty sure the for-loop will run slower than the enumerable each method that arrays inherit

when summing an arrays over a specific axis the dedicated arrays method array.sum ax may actually be slower than a for-loop


cleaner employeehourslist simple
a simple for-loop would be cleaner assuming employeehourslist is a arrays or similar

but modifying the arrays is more work than a simple for-loop again


longer data hits
the longer the arrays gets the more iterations your for-loop will need

the hits arrays is longer than numtotalhits so your for-loop limit should be numtotalhits instead of hits.length

this arrays can be longer so i have to read it s data with a for-loop like this

or if data is an arrays a for-loop will give you more flexibility

note that this is one of those cases where matrix division of large arrays takes longer than a for-loop


current int second
the key is to track how many rounds of division the for-loop goes through until the quotient of the current time minus the input time divided by th value of the arrays item is less than the th value of this arrays

then for-loop the rest arrays start from the second arrays to the last and if the size of the current arrays is smaller than the value of minsize then set both minsize to the size of the current arrays in the for-loop and shortestpath to the reference of the current arrays in the for-loop

first build a new arrays simple for-loop which cycles through all elements and stores in a new temp arrays check for all elements higher than my arrays so for input 50 the elements 100 80 66 are higher so discard them and then my new arrays is 25 4 2 1

on every cycle of your for-loop when you need to delete an item inside your arrays just create a new char arrays which is smaller and copy the contents of the old one to the new except for the value you deleted

in addition for the second for-loop for printing int arrays you d better using x aone i .length instaed of x aone.length since it will cause issue when the number of rows and the numbers of columns in int arrays are different

you need to leave the computation of the average in your current for-loop and then create a second for-loop and an int count variable which you will increment each time you find a number in the ba arrays that is smaller than the average


solution old possible
as mentioned above as you remove items the arrays gets smaller so a for-loop is probably not the best solution

if you don t want to remember or google up all those methods every time you need to iterate an arrays just stick to the good old for-loop which is way faster anyway

readability is a big reason for functions using recursion rather than loops makes them easier to follow and for using the iteration methods where possible map to transform an arrays values-by-value rather than a for-loop

for more than three possible locations an arrays and a for-loop would be the nicer solution

i tried this code with my the big arrays it is around 10 to 20 times faster than a for-loop solution and around 200 times fast than the old code


faster easier foreach-loop
although an enhanced for-loop on a string arrays is much faster than it is on an more on that below the .tostring .split overhead would appear to still dominate and make that version slower than the arraylist version

but because of the overhead in the for-loop and the second arrays it is slower as the before mentioned arr.filter as shown by this jsperf

and i want to do this for-loop faster fill up the output arrays which has a higher 2nd dimension in a cumulative fashion from its previous value .

the for-loop is faster than the foreach-loop if the arrays must only be

so which for-loop would be quicker at using the arrays

this is still slower than for-loop mostly due to intermediate arrays creation but much faster than stream version

first if you use python list convert it to numpy arrays it make faster your computation in comparing from the for-loop you just use

comparing this against bluevoxel s code using a time-series of 50 000 data points and computing the auto-correlation for a single fixed value of lag the python for-loop code averaged about 30 milli-seconds and using numpy arrays averaged faster than 0.3 milli-seconds running on my laptop

edit using an enhanced for-loop is a lot better than using arrays

i created an arrays of skspritenodes and used a for-loop to make life easier

the for-loop is faster than the foreach-loop if the arrays must only be accessed once per iteration

thus the for-loop is faster than the foreach-loop if the arrays must

using arrays subscriptions and a for-loop are much easier to read

is there a simpler way than a for-loop to create this arrays or no

also for printing arrays i recomend to use the enhanced for-loop it is easier

isn t there an easier way than the for-loop to build this arrays

it returns a byte arrays of all the pixels which can be iterated much faster than a for-loop with a call to getpixel inside nested inside another for-loop

with one arrays one can do which is easier than a for-loop

1.0 faster than a for-loop iterating over an indexed arrays of 1kk elements for 9.0 plusmn

shouldn t a for-loop be slower because of bound checking on the arrays

wondering if there is an easier way with a for-loop - looping through an arrays or similar

use hashmap that it has o 1 speed also iterate the arrays of integers in enhanced for-loop because it is slightly faster than ordinary for-loop

use a for-each loops to go through a range it s not as fast as using a variant arrays but keeps things simple and offers better speed than a for-loop

i completely failed to check that assertion and just jumped into the analysis of how the enhanced for-loop is faster on arrays than lists

yesterday i was testing whether using a for-loop for adding up elements in and arrays was worse than using the built-in matlab function sum as far i understand this should be the case since built-in functions are pre-compiled however i got some weird results

you can use a for-loop in this case extending one of the arrays elements is better than creating another arrays

this is the reason why working with the higher-dimensional arrays ends up being so much faster than the for-loop -based code

edit #2 but this was faster than a for-loop for a test i ran on an arrays of a million points

if you can get away with using an arrays using a for-loop might be slightly faster than foreach

when you know both objects are arrays method is a faster way to check equality than for-loop

for example sometimes a for-loop is faster than the built-in arrays methods in some browsers

in this case instead of generating two large matrices with the row and column indices you can use a for-loop on the rows of your arrays it s slower but not as slow as a double for-loop

would an arrays be faster than a for-loop in this case

looping with a for-loop is nothing more than a basic iteration of an arrays using a for-loop

defining every next jagged arrays arrays of each column in the for-loop would be trickier but i think i can do it using string to hold my numbers and then using .split to assign value to the arrays

having seen a question here on so about joining strings i have done some testing and came to knowledge that joining a string in a foreach is slower than with a for-loop and using the indexes in the arrays

after jgauffin suggestion i used johnskeet code and found that the for-loop with arrays is faster than following

iterating pair-wise you d normally do something like but iterating over an arrays is faster than using a c-style for-loop


hiawatha	apache---------------------------------------------------

others
i had the same problem configuring apache until i gave up and change to hiawatha much more easy to configure and according some benchmark is faster than apache


freertos	ecos---------------------------------------------------

others
in 2009 for example freertos was downloaded more than 77500 times and ecos has extensive support for file-systems and networking etc


clojure.test	midje---------------------------------------------------

others
i used midje for a while but found clojure.test felt purer but that was down to taste


monocross	mvvmcross---------------------------------------------------

others
from my own observations it seems that stuart lodge s mvvmcross has experienced much more community momentum than monocross


ati	nvidia---------------------------------------------------

others
for example on ati cards you ll want to manually vectorize code using float4 int4 data types or accept a nearly 4x performance penalty while nvidia works better with scalar data types

ati seems to tell more than nvidia

4 is nvidia cuda technology is easier more flexible than ati brook+ language

there is almost always some driver issue between them but in general nvidia is better for opengl has bugs in directx implementation and ati amd versions only is better for directx has bugs in opengl implementation

i decided on nvidia for a couple of reasons while ati might be faster on paper nvidia has a more mature platform and more documentation so it will be possible to get closer to the peak performance on this platform

another reason to choose nvidia is because that s what the hpc system builders have been building systems with since nvidia made a huge push for gpgpu computing where as it s less backed by amd ati

nvidia is more permissive for example nvidia lets you cast wrongly ie float4 to float only making it a warning ati won t error

i m having an issue where my glsl 130 code wont run properly on my somewhat modern ati 5850 hardware while the identical code runs perfectly fine on an older laptop with a nvidia card i have

the development tools a debugger and a profiler plus an entire online development community that come for free with the nvidia sdk are way more useful than anything that comes with the ati stuff

more useful with nvidia than ati for example

for example i ve noticed nvidia s glsl compiler is a little more picky than ati s and rejects some shader code that otherwise works fine

a co-worker says there s fewer issues with an ati card at home than with nvidia but i ve been updating my video drivers pretty much monthly for the past few months and it s still not resolved so we can t just release our product and just tell our customers that some day the driver manufacturers may get around to fixing this


support linux rendermonkey
nvidia provide much better driver support in linux than ati do

the reason i ask is that it seems like nvidia has way better tools and ati seems to have cancelled rendermonkey


flambe	openfl---------------------------------------------------

others
the main defference between these two is that awe6 is using openfl to target platforms such as ios and adnroid while flambe is focused more on html5 and flash games


openfeint	scoreloop---------------------------------------------------

others
further to this i m still opting for scoreloop and i can confirm this behaves the same regarding one score per user but it offers a lot more functionality and does seem to respond much quicker than openfeint did for me


retrofit	okhttp---------------------------------------------------

service different solution
first you have many different library you can use instead of retrofit the basic one and i think the simplest is okhttp but you have to understand that okhttp is no more supported but still work when you downgrade your sdkversion and you can use volley to perform the same service as retrofit

the basic one and i think the simplest is okhttp but you have to understand that okhttp is no more supported but still work when you downgrade your sdkversion the best solution is to use volley or retrofit


others
see also the retrofit guide which uses okhttp and makes it easier to

the point of using okhttp instead of the defaulthttpclient by apache is that okhttp is threadsafe for android and better supported by retrofit

note that if you have json and rest then retrofit is going to be better than pure okhttp

i have created this library that is built on top of okhttp and have more features and customization than retrofit

since you re using android and retrofit i suggest using okhttp wich is better supported by retrofit and android thread safe the way to this is the following


jquery	curvycorners---------------------------------------------------

others
i know another plugin named jquery corner is available however it s file size being massively bigger than curvycorners i decided to with curvycorners


explode	substr---------------------------------------------------

others
which should at least perform better than explode str_replace and substr solutions

explode separates the string by characters there should be only one anyways so maybe a substr would be slightly more efficient and array_pop removes and returns the last one which should be everything after the and be the domain of the email

just wanted to add that using strrpos + substr is slightly faster than explode + end

although this is much faster than explode without the limit it is not as fast as the substr solution suggested by the user set sail media


xtragrid	radgridview---------------------------------------------------

others
i have used the .net s griddataview without any problems using the virtual mode while trying to show over 10000 rows but there are good products out there that are also very good in loading tons of data like developer express xtragrid and telerik s radgridview


vim	sublimetext---------------------------------------------------

others
personally i m using sublimetext right now which i find easier than vim for searching and navigating the code but everyone has their taste

sublimetext or webstorm are far more accessible than vim so it usually happens with their editor rather than mine

textmate isn t known to perform well on large files but sublimetext supposedly performs better than vim on large files and yet supports legacy textmate syntax parsers


listboxitem	textbox---------------------------------------------------

others
textbox autosizes to its content that s ok but when drag apperas the listboxitem becomes wider and move other items it s not ok


installation	downgrade---------------------------------------------------

others
unfortunately sql server 2008 r2 sp2 and sql server 2012 does not support installation over that data which is especially obvious if the previous installation was a newer version than the present one in which case there is no way to downgrade the database schema versions


range	minimum---------------------------------------------------

others
to summarize the problem given time range t1 and t2 on day d how can i determine the remaining time left in d that is longer than the minimum time block m

this obviously means that range is less than its minimum of 1

minimum 1.6.0 is not less then range maximum 1.0.0 inclusion is

therefore there is no hard guarantee saying that the size of long must be equal to or greater than that of size_t but by current implementation standards say 2 s complement representation long will always be larger than the minimum size of size_t by virtue of having to store a larger range than that which is currently equivalent to that which can be stored by size_t minimally

but if there are less birds than the minimum spawns to wait for an argument out of range error would be thrown

i want to combine range where the difference b w minimum and maximum of another range with respect to the considered range is less than or equal to 300 i e

but even with the minimum required range it s more than big enough for your loop

how to get random number between given range in java if minimum is more than 1

this is slightly better than the minimum allowed for mediump as it can represent all of the ints in the range -2048 to 2048 source not the -1024 to 1024 that you re worrying about

if you use the range compression consider setting the required distance at least as large as the expected rms error for the gps device likly to be about 5m minimum use a longer distance if you can stand it


circle half numberlowexception
the unfortunate side effect is that half your circle will be cut off as it extends into the range that is less than your minimum value

if the value is less than the minimum value of the range it should throw a numberlowexception

the -7 argument is less than the minimum allowed range of 0


contionuous values max
now you can see in the product.rb i want to fetch the product based on the price so that in the with_min_range the result will be the products whose variants minimum price range will be greater than the value of min

the cause for an integer overflow is when an arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value that is outside of the range that can be represented with a given number of bits either larger than the maximum or lower than the minimum representable value

what i can t seem to wrap my head around is how to determine the minimum value for the second argument to range that can guarantee the last value in the range is greater than max_val

to get the same difference with two different numbers one of them has to be either less than the minimum or more than the maximum of the initial range which is contradictory

you may initialize both scores to an value lower than the minimum for instance if scores range from 0 to 10 you may initialize them in -1

the maximum length is only one more than the minimum length abc de fgh i jkl mn opq has seven sub-lists as well but the range of lengths is two here

the objective function is guaranteed to be finite and contionuous in the interpolation range along with its first and second derivatives and has no more than one minimum in this range if it has no minimum it is monotonic

for any particular set of hyperparameters this range is much closer to the minimum response than to the maximum

for this reason you need to either try and be smarter than just setting a limit or set you limit a bit higher than the minimum operating range of the sensor

if there is a run for a particular serialnum earlier than the minimum date of the range it won t be excluded

for each low end of the range find the minimum high end of a range that is greater than or equal to the low end or in sql

to date is greater than the minimum date lesser than the larger date but not in range

a range is contiguous when there is no value one smaller than the minimum and no value one bigger than the maximum and there is no gap within the range

if the 32-bit float range is larger than -1..1 then you need to find the minimum and maximum values and calculate a scale factor that gets the samples within the int16 range

but my problem is that the maximum and minimum salary are not known or if the range are smaller then i had to write alot of codes to get the result

the reductive point here is the expression can actually be simplified to just the range that has the greater minimum value and the lesser maximum value

i have hinted at my analysis of the problem finding the common range of depth values across all datasets and you should be able to track through how i have implemented this in excel to cater for cases where some datasets might contain depth values which are less than the minimum of the common range or which are greater than its maximum or possibly both

basically the result is to find a criteria in row and then in other range find minimum higher than 0 and maximum value

the smallest most negative value that does not cause a range error is the one greater than the minimum exponent minus the number of bits of mantissa

figuring out the necessary exponent range is much more straightforward if you can describe the max and min possible absolute values of your input you can easily find suitable corresponding binary minimum and maximum exponent

how about for integer values you specify a range and a predicate that specifies the value must be greater than minimum less than maximum instead


skip-lists	tree---------------------------------------------------

others
for example if you want to implement an equivalent of std map it would be a pain to do it with a red-black tree but a skip-lists is much more manageable


bounds asymptotic faster
skip-lists algorithms have the same asymptotic expected time bounds as balanced tree and are simpler faster and use less space

that is not exactly what i was expecting from skip-lists algoriths have the same asymptotic expected time bounds as balanced tree and are simple faster and use less space pug89


data queue b
in a single thread world is different you can use a sorted set a binary tree or your custom data structure that would perform better than concurrent skip-lists

thus write-heavy data structures are probably better implemented mutably and with something like a skip-lists where you only need to lock locally while read-heavy data structures are probably better implemented immutably where a tree is a more natural data structure

the most simple would be an array but a double-ended queue or an indexed skip-lists b tree could be better depending on the data size we are talking about


search e.g performance
balanced binary search tree will perform more poorly than a skip-lists in such a case as skip lists require no rebalancing and skip lists are also inherently sorted like a bst

i doubt that the skip-lists was the better choice than an e.g an avl tree even in 1989

so as you can see the random binary search tree was rather a lot better than the skip-lists

skip-lists isn t any more difficult to implement than a self-balancing binary tree and gives much better performance in some situations


prometheus	metrics---------------------------------------------------

others
for single server metrics ingest i would expect prometheus to have better performance although we ve done no testing here and have no numbers because of their more constrained data model and because they don t append writes to disk before writing out the index


elasticsearch	fluentd---------------------------------------------------

others
i want to have the milliseconds or better captured by fluentd and then passed on to elasticsearch so that the entries are shown in the correct order


wxpython	pygtk---------------------------------------------------

others
also pygtk is lighter than wxpython but i ended up bitting the bullet and using wxpython for the same purpose recently it is heavy but it didn t have any affect on the script performance

thanks to opencv i managed to rewrite everything with wxpython which i know better than pygtk

now all that said...you might get more visual appeal with pygtk pyqt or wxpython though tkinter coming standard is a nice feature


vaadin	smartgwt---------------------------------------------------

others
thus i think vaadin is more suitable for intranet and takes less time to develop your app while smartgwt is better for more complex gui or unstable connections where additional roundtrips matter


mathml	tex---------------------------------------------------

others
i want to type tex equations in onenote send them to mathtype which converts it to mathml and has a more feature-rich editor and send them back afterwards


pascal	delphi---------------------------------------------------

others
from my pov the object pascal paradigm used with fpc object pascal dialect which can coexist with the default object pascal code is more advanced lightweight and integrated than the interface-based plumbing of delphi xe2 compiler with on-the-fly marshalling using rtti

languages that can be compiled in a single pass eg pascal derivatives like delphi compile far quicker 10 6 loc in seconds

pascal and also delphi is more centered on readability than the c syntax languages which are more centered on character power as much information per character as possible

i have large amounts of pascal code that i need to compile into android applications and i would like to know how to make delphi generate more efficient code

if you prefer tp delphi dialect free pascal is the better choice

delphi users might want to look at free pascal s paralel implementation of libchm since a pascal solution makes it easier embeddable

for my application i need to create a dll from delphi to be more precise delphi compatible code written within lazarus ide compiled by free pascal under linux using stdcall

you probably don t want to go back to anything earlier than delphi 3 but some pascal programming books can be helpful

there is the mono project that aims to allow .net code to run on mac and linux but between the two delphi being pascal is somewhat more portable

in free and turbo pascal file handling is much more easier than in delphi in pascal we have assign instead of assignfile and close instead of closefile


fleet	orchestration---------------------------------------------------

others
fleet docs say fleet is no longer actively developed or maintained by coreos and link to container orchestration moving from fleet to kubernetes


viewdidappear	viewwillappear---------------------------------------------------

others
in this case viewdidappear behaves more like viewwillappear ..

actually as per view life cycle the methods are called in following manner init loadview viewdidload viewwillappear viewwilllayoutsubviews called more than once viewdidlayoutsubviews called multiple time and lastly viewdidappear

suggestion is to put operation in viewdidappear but it also seems to work in viewwillappear and is slightly less ugly


gridbaglayout	boxlayout---------------------------------------------------

others
boxlayout is far easier than gridbaglayout because you don t have to learn how to specify constraints

although madprogrammers comment to use a gridbaglayout is an easier solution but knowing about glue and struts can be helpful for customizing the layout of a boxlayout


gdk	cairo---------------------------------------------------

others
to draw you can use either plain gdk which is more basic or use cairo which is more flexible drawing library nb


http	spdy---------------------------------------------------

others
the main benefits that you will get for soap rest communication are the fact that spdy can do http header compression reducing bandwidth and multiplexing - that is being able to send multiple requests on the same physical connection

spdy a google initiated proposal to extend http using a more efficient wire protocol but maintaining all http semantics request response cookies encoding

anything that you do with http is more or less equivalent with spdy and neither is really anything but an implementation detail of your soa work

in fact with optimizations like spdy you might find that a tls-secured connection actually performs better than plain http

spdy is a more efficient protocol than http

http 2 is even better than spdy and check this article for a use case regarding spdy


kivy	vispy---------------------------------------------------

others
i didn t try it because i m more familiar with kivy s internals and because my end goal was more of a kivy app containing vispy visualisations rather than the other way around


lisp	prolog---------------------------------------------------

others
i also checked prolog and it seems a pretty cool language easy to do relations between data and easier than lisp but i d like to hear what you think


picasso	ion---------------------------------------------------

others
use one of the image loading libraries glide square picasso universal-image-loader or ion ion is actually more of a general purpose async loading tool to do the dirty work for you


glfw	glew---------------------------------------------------

others
if you are a noob then i don t think that starting with mesa running on any kind of vm is a good idea.mesa setup is pretty complex in general.also mesa opengl is outdated.it supports up to 3.2 version atm.if you want to get started with opengl the right and clean way you should better setup context with libs like glut or glfw and load gl extension with glew there are more


xquery	schematron---------------------------------------------------

others
but xquery will be more than schematron and i use xquery heavily to validate xml values and i should be able to produce html reports well


geocoding	geocode---------------------------------------------------

others
can the geocode gem support more than one geocoding step

if this code challenge is for a uwp app then it is possible that the built in geocode may return more decimal places as it currently uses a different geocoding engine at the moment

2 location + reverse geocoding - seems more reliable but requests location services on the device does it work on wifi only tablets and for it to be enabled and requires time to a fetch location b server call to reverse geocode

i had a similar problem using ggmap geocode for a batch of locations where roughly 20 of locations gave the over query limit error even though geocodequerycheck would show more than enough geocoding queries remaining and the errors were sporadically spread throughout the locations not just the last 20

the geocoding api works better than geocode normally but has usage limits and the implementation is bigger


hibernate	jdbi---------------------------------------------------

others
other useful pieces would be jdbi for database access much simpler than hibernate or other full orms async-httpclient for doing calls to other web services


kerberos	ldap---------------------------------------------------

others
active directory is far more than ldap - at the very least you d need kerberos but it also tightly integrates with dns both srv and a records which d require significant trickiness to fake over an ssl connection

one might want to define kerberos access to more than one ldap server

in short as an authentication protocol kerberos is far more secure out of the box is de-centralized and will put less load on your directory authentication servers than ldap will


jquery	anythingslider---------------------------------------------------

others
in the anythingslider documentation there is a reference to getting anythingslider to work with older jquery libraries but i can t find any place to download old versions of anythingslider


jtable	jlabel---------------------------------------------------

others
why don t you do a simple test that tries to read and display an image in a jlabel first since using a jtable is more complicated than using a jlabel

i want to use a jpanel and then put jlabel if using jtable is easier then i will use that please tell me which will display the data


maven	pom.xml---------------------------------------------------

khmarbaise plugin setup
but thn i get presented with a setup maven plugin connectors dialog and the pom.xml file shows more errors

i agree with khmarbaise above the versions-maven-plugin will do just this or you could move to the maven release plugin if you want a much heftier approach to managing your versions but you could also just run a script to sed the pom.xml file using jenkins build_number environment variable which is a quicker and dirtier approach


others
so i looked in the local maven repo and realized i had not updated by target project pom.xml to use the newer snapshot version of the connector project

sure there is a learning curve with maven but reading a pom.xml is far easier than reading a build.xml

it will depend on the complexity of your builds if you have basic java builds then maven might be more suited as the pom.xml files maven build filds are pretty simple but if you need to do a lot of custom specific stuff you may well end up having ant scripts to perform also if you already have one system in place there isnt necessarily a huge advantage of swapping

keep in mind that a maven project is more than just the pom.xml file it also conforms to the maven standard directory layout and more but that should get you started

i add the plugin to my pom.xml like so you will need to upgrade maven to v3.1 or higher to use the plugin

since having a single maven module produce more than one artifact is generally a bad idea it would be best if you isolate this in a maven module of type pom.xml so that this would be its only artifact

assume this plugin config is in a parent pom.xml only maven super pom.xml is higher up in the hierarchy

once the set of projects has been validated maven now does some more parsing of those pom.xml files to construct the list of build extensions if any and the list of plugins

when maven is going deeper it falls back to normal pom.xml

that doesn t cover some of the more fundamental problems with maven such as its namespaces breaking java namespaces and xml namespaces it s build unit the pom.xml having no relation to anything in the actual deployment environment think about it when you separate via poms what are you actually accomplishing in the finished product

it has some downsides- namely working with both ant and maven so the actual pom.xml is more difficult to comprehend but it does allow for more flexibility than is otherwise possible with maven

also find projects that are utilizing maven and look into their pom.xml configurations learn more about what is possible with maven

maven uses the classifier construct for artefacts build from the same pom.xml but differing in there content for example one for jdk1.6 or jdk1.7

this is a more general problem with maven 2 it doesn t allow any pom.xml code reuse expect properties and custom plugins

converting to maven requires more work -- afaik there is no official tool or wizard that allows you to generate a full pom.xml configuration from an existing eclipse project

you would be able to circumvent this by first running mvn clean install on magnicompcommon s pom.xml then on model pom.xml but this is much easier done by invoking maven directly on the root pom.xml


downloads comfortable dependency
for those who are more comfortable with maven you could add this dependency to your pom.xml file

one more thing as in maven we can update or if we save the pom.xml file maven downloads all those dependency automatically


reverse-engineering	obfuscation---------------------------------------------------

others
but my current project really does require obfuscation to make reverse-engineering more difficult


jstl	taglib---------------------------------------------------

others
generally i noted that jstl sql taglib is much slower than java code because it put all the result set into an hashmap


d3.js	c3.js---------------------------------------------------

others
c3.js sits on top of d3.js to provide more accessible charts because d3.js while powerful is a wily beast to work with for common use-cases

but i don t want to use d3.js because some other feature in c3.js is better


button	checkbox---------------------------------------------------

others
i ve got a script for ensuring the user doesn t check more than 4 checkbox but i can t find a way to ensure that the submit button is disabled if they have selected less than 4 items

i have group of checkbox each of this checkbox associated to a li tag which contain a query result i have also button so i want when i check more than one checkbox and after that click on button i want to display text of li tag for each selected checkobox

on the server off jsfiddle the submit button sits inline with the checkbox and tick text and the checkbox sits higher than the tick text rather than inline

in both cases plus minus same except in case where is the small checkbox the button is bigger on width maybe it is related with space for checkbox

running the snippet you can see a static checkbox bootstrap rendered and a button to add more checkbox

i ve got a box with checkbox and i wanted that button submit appear only if one checkbox was marked when more than one box is checked the button submit must disappear i ve tried code it using addclass and removeclass provides by jquery here s my code for now

then you can see a few checkbox and at the bottom there are two button you can also use hyperlinks but button are easier to work with

i have an application with three textviews and one checkbox in each row of a listview.what i want that on a click of a button i will be able to get the state of each checkbox and the row corresponding to ischecked checkbox get deleted.one more thing my checkbox are hardcoded in an xml file.i have searched a lot but couldn t find anything specific.thanks in advance.here is my code.

so if more than 2 checkbox are selected then a button named group appears

each time a checkbox is changed and less than 2 in the form are checked changehandler calls the next function to make sure that the checkbox are fully functional and disables the submit button so that the form cannot be submitted

we replaced the button and now they work but the checkbox would be more difficult to replace so i was hoping there was a way to fix them

since you want more of a show hide button i think a better experience is to have a checkbox that indicates what state you re going to set it to instead of relying on the first item

see the red rectangle you can click the middle button and checked hover checkbox then you will find the reason

a button may be more appropriate for clearing the checkbox

newly created groups click more than 2 checkbox then a group button will appear now click the group button then an alert pop will appear asking you to enter group name.enter some name and click ok.then that name will now appear on the right side group table.now clcik the group name then those members will be selected.i want to the same from existing groups also.please tell me how

for example tri-state checkbox aren t particularly intuitive and providing a drop-down or set of three radio button is more approchable for those less technically inclined

i have put a button for each row which i want to create on click event for it to get the id of that row and be able to send user to second page to edit that row info but i have problem with checking this multiple button if it were checkbox it was easier

i ve been trying to apply icheck plugins to my radio and checkbox and i just cannot figure out why my radio button keep selecting more than a single option with no experience in jquery i think i might need help with this

what i d like to do is make the button images slightly larger than the checkbox and have the text checkbox and both button on the same line

since you are creating a submit button for each form but you seem to want to trigger the submit when the checkbox is changed a simpler solution might be

when i reload my html pages its button select and checkbox are goes added more and more.because all the html data fetch from a data base and after added new things in the page i store all the html of the page in data base and when i display this page agiain becuase of jquery mobile its button select and checkbox are increased check here visit jsfiddle.net sharma9853 gbe6p 7

showing button when items selected by checkbox are more than one

checkall and uncheckall on single button is worked if there is more than one checkbox present.but it will not worked for single checkbox

i have created a php form with multiple checkbox and there is a script that controls if the sum sum of all checkbox values is greater than a specific number.if yes a sweetalert box appears.the problem is that when i click the ok button on the sweetalert i want to remove the last checked attribute and to remove that value from the sum to execute the script again and display the right results.i cannot figure this out..any ideas will be helpful

a checkbox or an extra button would be clearer for the user

the problem is that if i have more than one checkbox checked and i want to uncheck one the button disables

since i have many checkbox as mentioned earlier i want that when i write a certain controls name in a1 when i click the button that control will take the value in a2

the user will check a few more than 1 checkbox and hit the start button which will send out emails with information on checkbox selected in the dynamic table

you need two button one for up and one for down or you could use one button and a checkbox for up or down but i think two button is simpler

one option is to use the preupdate hook and add a checkbox to the edit action but a button would be much nicer

what i want to do is if you try to select more than 6 checkbox it will automatically disable all the button however if you tap the even one of the checked checkbox it will make all the checkbox checkable

i saw he used checkbox which to seems much more useful than button since you can take multiple objects out at a time

obviously for something like show hide functionality a checkbox makes more sense than a button

i have a form with multiple checkbox and a button by default the button will be disable but after checking at least 2 or more than 2 checkbox the button should become active

but works fine if more than 6 checkbox are selected then reduced to 6 with more than one button click

what i want to do is place two controls at the same position spot to be specific a button that contains a progressbar inside of it and a button that contains a icon once the progress bar is full i want to switch it to the button which has the icon like a checkbox toggle button it has more than one state when i change it it changes the controls


row next value
i can verify that by unchecking the checkbox it does flip the value because i enable disable the next button depending on the myproperty value - i have more than one checkbox btw

currently i am able to generate checkbox in column what i need is one more column with button same as checkbox in each row

as image shows below i want to make next button enabled only if more than one checkbox get checked

in my project on click of checkbox and add more button i am trying to add one row and on click of remove button remove exact row

initially the value of button is disable because value of button is true so the button is disabled.after selecting the checkbox now the button should be able to click

if i ticked more than one checkbox only one row is deleted each time i clicked delete button


better radio appropriate
i know we could use activex radio button but we d prefer to avoid activex if possible plus with checkbox we have more control over the layout

if you only want one to be checked at a time then radio button would seem a better choice although if you want one or zero at a time then checkbox are fine

perhaps checkbox would be better but by using the button and a an extra checked class

well actually you would be better off with checkbox control and you can make it look just like regular button

everything is better than a checkbox or a button with autopostback set to true nowadays in year 2011 2012 soon

essentially radio button are a more semantically correct way of styling a toggle and they can be styling to look like a toggle just like checkbox could too

some checkbox are shown under more than one radio button

edit since you say you can t add a none option and want to use a checkbox even though i strongly disagree on checkbox where a radio button is more appropriate - a common ui error .

checkbox may be a better fit than button here

note that onclick is better supported with checkbox and radio button than is onchange

side note if you only have one radio button on the page maybe a checkbox would be more appropriate

when there is more than 1 checkbox s they do not work as a group like radio button such that only one 1 radio button can be selected when there is more than 1

one more thing i also want select only one radio button when i have selected more than 2 checkbox

on a side note are your sure radio button wouldn t be better suited to your needs you will be able to see the definite answer for each questions whereas checkbox are more for submitted only the selected checkbox

you want your toggle button to behave more like radio rather than checkbox so why not just convert them all to radio

i have noticed that in your form you are using checkbox where radio button would fit better like for field mobile

using checkbox to check uncheck is better than radio button

actually i found out why using two radio button with same names and different values true and false is better than checkbox

if you want the users to select only one option perhaps a dropdown or radio button list is more suitable rather than checkbox

note there may be a way to do this with checkbox but radio button were easier to toggle between

unlike radio button the user can select more than one checkbox at once or select none of them at all

checkbox and radio button were working well earlier

i would suggest adding some validation to make sure at least one of your checkbox is checked or better still change them to radio button with your default pre-selected

anyway as stated by other a radio button would be better you can style it as a checkbox if that s what you need

as such creating a radio button rather than checkbox is a better solution

i am using icheck plugin to make my checkbox and radio button looks better

if it s only one colour you want selecting you can use a radio button instead which would be a better idea than a checkbox


select box alert
what i want to do is if a user checks the more than 1 checkbox all radio button must turn into checkbox and users must be able to check more options

i agree that checkbox have more of an implicit true false meaning another point is that for radio button you can force the user to make an active choice by having neither option selected

here i am retriving data from database and i am doing insert update and delete of data using checkbox.my problem is when i click more than two checkbox than also i am moving to update.php page but what i actually want is that when i click on update button first it will check that only one checkbox is selected from list if not than alert message should display like select only one checkbox

i have an asp page where the status of a list is approved by selecting checkbox and then pressing approve button however when i select more than one checkbox it throws the error index was out of range

on a button click javascript validation should be if a user select one checkbox it should allow to process further to any script but when user selects more than one checkbox it should prompt that you can select only one check box

how to restrict user to select not more than 10 asp.net checkbox on button click event if user select more than 10 checkbox then alert box will pop up that you can not select more than 10 checkbox


instance options side
side note the checkbox you have there imply that the user should only be choosing one of them something can t simultaneously be on time and late for instance - radio button would be a better ui choice here

my initial idea was to use radio button for the options because of its exclusion functionality but maybe using checkbox provides a better solution


values custom property
you ll want to have multiple radio button each with it s own value to set some property to although this is weird for a yes no you are better off with a checkbox but if you had multiple values this is how radio button work

so the values can be mapped with each list now by the property of checkbox you can select more than one checkbox unlike radio button so when such case comes the dropdownlistfor that is being populated on the basis of each checkbox selection now comes in a merged format like on selecting option 1 and option 2 both the list contains all the elements mapped to both further on de-selecting it comes back to unmerged state

so i think a custom checkbox is the better choice here but if you really want to use a button i would use a hidden checkbox field and apply onclick functions to the button to change the value of a hidden checkbox field

create a universal analytics tag click the enable overriding settings in this tag checkbox go to more settings custom dimensions click the add custom dimension button enter in the left field the numeric index as obtained via the ga property settings and in the right field your value variable


table visible column
i have a table and it has checkbox what i want is when more than two checkbox are selected my button should be visible and vice versa

the table contains a checkbox column and a button column button column may contains more than 1 button


strtol	atoi---------------------------------------------------

errors int checking
all have more or less cumbersome and non-obvious error checking involving errno strtol is way much better than atoi in any case so avoid using atoi

once you ve done that you can use strcmp to see if the string is equal to stop and if not then call atoi or better yet strtol which has better error checking to get the numerical value

i used atoi to convert the string to int but for a more robust solution it s better to use strtol but for your example atoi is more than enough

besides strtol is a better option than atoi as strtol can handle failures better

you need to error check strtol and ensure there are as many passed before using them -- strtol is better than atoi as helps detect errors

strtol is better than atoi with better error handling

you can also look into strtol which is better than using atoi in terms of error checking

use strtol it does better error reporting than atoi

instead of atoi using a better function like strtol which allows error checking

the c function strtol is much better make it a habit to prefer that one to atoi

for instance strtol is better than atoi and you should be checking each time whether strtok returns null

i would recommend strtol which provides better error handling than atoi or sscanf

if you want to accept a number rather than a digit and only a number strtol works much better than atoi as it allows you to check for failures


better
strtol can be a better atoi specifically w.r.t

you can also use strtol which is obviously better than atoi


others
i understand that strtol and strtof are preferred to atoi atof since the former detect errors and also strtol is much more flexible than atoi when it comes to non-base-10

i start off calling gets to fill the buffer then using strtol to convert the human-readable text in buffer to an actual computer int value - note that strtol is more powerful than atoi and uses long int instead of int as its declared type

also instead of using atoi use the safer counterpart strtol

so when trying to make things more reliable as atoi and easier to use as strtol solutions like kirilenko s would be used


scons	autotools---------------------------------------------------

others
edit i was hoping not to turn this into another flame war but i guess that s inevitable so i will just say that i have considerably more experience with autotools and no desire to learn cmake or scons or imake or ant although i seem pretty much stuck with the latter when working with java these days or whatever new tool is invented next year or the year after


puma	webrick---------------------------------------------------

others
puma also has better concurrency but that threadsafe confgi make webrick multi-thread for me


gridbaglayout	grouplayout---------------------------------------------------

others
i find grouplayout to be fine to code by hand certainly no harder than gridbaglayout though i can certainly see why it would be a favorite for tools to use


simplier easier hard
so maybe a gridbaglayout will be easier to use than the grouplayout

i recommend you not to use grouplayout is really hard instead of you can try to use gridbaglayout it s simplier


cublas	openblas---------------------------------------------------

others
first of them works quite good on cpu intel i7 and on fermi gpu gf 540m cpu time is near to openblas and fermi gpu time is near to cublas about 18ms but this implementation works 10x slower than cublas on maxwell gpu titanx - 5 ms vs 0.4 ms


jsf	tapestry---------------------------------------------------

others
in my opinion this is a more elegant solution than jsf and i think tapestry s ioc container makes it more powerful than wicket

one framework that tries to do more in the template while remaining less bloated than jsf which isn t that hard anyway is apache tapestry


arp	udp---------------------------------------------------

others
if you are using linux check out netdiscover this uses arp i think arp is lower level than tcp udp and with java you can only create apps from tcp udp and above


jsf	stripes---------------------------------------------------

others
still jsf might have performance issues as compared to action-based frameworks like stripes which work more closely to http requests without building component model which is using more memory more network bandwidth

and beware that in this area there are many much more alternatives or fragmentation than in .net some more oriented to the mvc pattern struts struts2 stripes spring mvc some more component-based jsf tapestry wicket and some others gwt


agile	sprint---------------------------------------------------

others
agile could be more successfull when the application is in maintenance mode where the application is already in production and the dev is simply adding more features to the application in each sprint


postorder	inorder---------------------------------------------------

others
postorder is trickier because the stack has to store nodes to visit and nodes to process and they aren t always simply related like they are in the inorder case


unsigned	short---------------------------------------------------

chars good memory
this is pretty simple for types sizeof int but unsigned chars short is more complicated and requires compiler specific packing

or would it be good practice to use an unsigned chars in this case since it allocates less memory than a short int

when integral types like chars short int bool take less number of bytes than int then these data types are automatically promoted to int or unsigned int when an operation is performed on them

that s not so much the case any more now that we have multiple types larger than int but back when c was young the int types were chars short int and unsigned versions of those so all the other types were promoted to int and all code to manipulate anything was done with int s


others
firstly though we tend to use signed more than unsigned values which would lean us toward short but also ushort is not a cls-compliant type and there s hardly any point introducing an incompatibility with other .net languages in obtaining compatibility with com

branch to target if less than unsigned or unordered short form


operations implementation size
an unsigned char is an unsigned value which is typically smaller than and is guaranteed not to be bigger than a short

on your system unsigned int is apparently larger than uint16_t int is a greater ranked integer type than short in the standard 6.3.1.1 even if they are of the same size

the only constraints were that int s must be no smaller than short s and long s must be no smaller than int s and size_t must represent the largest unsigned type supported by an implementation

i used a short int to represent the numbers from -32000 to 32000 also i used unsigned to get bigger numbers

the rule for performing arithmetic operations in c c++ is that if the type such as short is narrower than int then it gets widened to int if all values can fit or unsigned int otherwise

but in case short is a smaller type than int it is always converted to signed int regardless of it the short was signed or unsigned


bufferedreader	printwriter---------------------------------------------------

others
and to use printwriter in place of bufferedreader would be more easy here


carrierwave	fog---------------------------------------------------

others
i ve read that carrierwave is much faster without using fog

one more example with gem fog and heroku configuration for carrierwave with amazon s3 hosted on heroku


outputstream	inputstream---------------------------------------------------

others
what i did not expect is that outputstream is much less bytes than inputstream although i have yet to make any modification on doc

you have to open an inputstream and an outputstream optionally get their more efficient filechannel s and use a buffer to transfer bytes

when i want to write the full contents of a file into an outputstream i usually allocate a buffer as a then make a for-loop to read data from the file s inputstream into the buffer and write the buffer contents into the outputstream until the inputstream has no more bytes available

then instead of using datainput outputstream you should use an objectoutput inputstream makes it easier in my opinion


screens	pixel-density---------------------------------------------------

others
just use media queries targeting a screens with lower resolution and use pixel-ratio and pixel-density to be more specific targetting modern mobile devices


squash	merge---------------------------------------------------

others
i see ones i merge master to feature branch i can not squash he commits any more using interactive rebase


aggregate-functions	sum---------------------------------------------------

others
i changed out total for sum which is more consistent with other databases sqlite aggregate-functions

system.linq.dynamic is too limited compared to normal linq - many functions are not supported doesn t like sub collections and requres you to use one of the supported aggregate-functions which are no more and no less than any count min max sum and average


answer version general
as an added answer there is also the aggregate-functions which is more general than sum

aggregate-functions is more general version of sum


sikuli	selenium---------------------------------------------------

others
sikuli would be a better platform for gui related stuffs other than browser ie for any applications in desktop but regarding browsers selenium would be the best tool rather than sikuli

or selenium combined with sikuli to have even more power.


scipy	pyomo---------------------------------------------------

others
pyomo runs in less than one minute and scipy takes 4 hours


kmz	gpx---------------------------------------------------

others
kmz loads much quicker than gpx and can be integrated with the google maps api as a kml layer


minimum	diagonal---------------------------------------------------

others
one way would be to fill the diagonal elements with something lesser than global minimum and then use argsort -

even with 32 levels of recusions it will never explode in a rectangular draw area whose diagonal is shorter than 2 32 pixels the limit would be reached only if you are splitting a virtual bezier in a virtually infinite space with floating-point coordinates but you don t intend to draw it directly because you won t have the 1 2 pixel limitation in such space and only if you have set an extreme value for the flatness such that your minimum square sine constant parameter is 1 2 32 or lower


ilist	iqueryable---------------------------------------------------

others
generally ienumerable and iqueryable are even better than ilist as they re more generic unless you want to limit this with good reason of course


ggplot2	lattice---------------------------------------------------

others
viewport manipulation is easier with lattice than ggplot2 that s why i choose a bwplot

i know it is much easier by using ggplot2 but i need to get it done by lattice

how can i plot a dotchart like lattice s dotchart in ggplot2 that has thicker grid lines and only horizontal grid lines ie remove the vertical grid lines kind of like this


uiview	uiwindow---------------------------------------------------

others
uiview is more generic than uiwindow and should be preferred


daemon	cron---------------------------------------------------

others
using cron should have less of a memory footprint than a php script - and you don t need to worry about memory leaks and the complications o running the php as a daemon

my first thought was to have a php script called by cron which could work but i m not sure if that s really scalable the best way to go about this would making a server-side daemon be better

but honestly cron is fairly lightweight and unless it needs to be real-time or whatever that means to you writing php into a daemon is more work than it s work


observer-pattern	mediator---------------------------------------------------

others
in my example that probably makes less sense then directly referencing the mediator but in many cases using observer-pattern to implement mediator would make sense and the difference between observer and mediator would be more one of intent than a difference in the code itself


lxml	celementtree---------------------------------------------------

others
as a side-effect of implementing proper parent traversal lxml is a bit slower than celementtree for parsing

instead doing it with lxml which i found to be the fastest somehow even faster than celementtree


xml world elementtree
while celementtree is fast the world standard lxml library which also implements the elementtree is faster still

the lxml library is proven much faster for parsing and un-parsing xml but celementtree is much faster for certain kinds of manipulation


operator-precedence	logical-or---------------------------------------------------

others
according to the mdn operator-precedence logical-and has a higher precidence over logical-or suggesting that the condition is evaluated as if were a single statement which then moves on to determine the boolean condition of false || true which is then true


hackage	stackage---------------------------------------------------

others
thanks for raising this issue we definitely want stackage to have better uptime guarantees than hackage


padrino	ruby-on-rails---------------------------------------------------

others
the nice thing about letting the plugin install it for you is that if you re more familiar with ruby-on-rails than padrino as is my case this will not only set things up for you but also show you were the directives need to go


better complex speed
but i don t know anything about sinatra and padrino is the footprint and speed really that better than ruby-on-rails

sinatra and padrino are not automatically faster than ruby-on-rails

as wuliwong said sinatra and padrino are way less complex than ruby-on-rails


dlsym	dlopen---------------------------------------------------

others
given that i know little about apache modules i would try to remove apache from the equation try writing a simple c program that does little more than a dlopen and possibly the subsequent dlsym then exits

on linux it would be easier for you to link to shared library and use symlinks to correct version - imo it s much easier than using dlopen + dlsym


neo4j	titan---------------------------------------------------

others
because it seems you re going to deploy a cluster i think titan is the better choice unless you re willing to pay for the enterprise edition of neo4j to support clustering

when the data is on disk titan is faster than neo4j cause it has a better disk representation


height	border-box---------------------------------------------------

others

header_wrapper better overflow
in the above code #header seems to overflow out of #header_wrapper because of and which adds up to more than the height of #header_wrapper and even though box-sizing border-box has been applied its still overflowing

adjust the padding and use box-sizing border-box to have better control of the height


organization	naming---------------------------------------------------

others
code with specific organization providing a simpler interface for different tasks and making it easier to integrate programmers in a project just by naming it


flask	web2py---------------------------------------------------

others
frameworks like flask cherrypy pyramid or even web2py might be the easier ones to start with


uitapgesturerecognizer	uibutton---------------------------------------------------

others
the first thought is that you could build a uiview showing image and text then attach a uitapgesturerecognizer to it which would be more flexible than uibutton


decimal	ieee---------------------------------------------------

others
double has its ieee floating point definition which is also much more complex than decimal

i understand the ieee rounding in r for values that are to one decimal place ie 0.5 becomes 0 1.5 becomes 2 but what about numbers that are to more than one decimal place

decimal types libraries are fantastic for financial applications because we re used to dealing with the style of rounding required in financial stuff but there is the cost that they tend to be slower than ieee floating point


base 64bit floating-point
the third line displays the data with the maximum useful precision - an ieee 754 64bit floating-point number has slightly less than 16 decimal digits of precision so all those digits of the literal in math.h are pointless perhaps they can be seen as future-proofing against a possible future redefinition in a format with more precision

the maximum representable value with ieee 754-2008 binary32 is so the base 2 log of a number stored in binary 32 is less than decimal 128


hbase	hypertable---------------------------------------------------

others
so i thought of using hbase but i googled up and known that hypertable is faster


gradle	ivy---------------------------------------------------

others
you get the same mechanism for other dependency managers like ivy oy gradle maven ivy ant gradle are more than just dependency managers but it s not the point here

ivy but gradle does it better

if you are looking for a more flexible build than ant or maven but at the same time utilize maven or ivy repositories you should consider gradle

today gradle comes with a full-fledged dependency management implementation that no longer builds upon ivy except for some traces that haven t been removed yet for backwards compatibility reasons

if you were to do that gradle would be simpler as it provides a nice abstraction on top of the nitty gritty maven ivy stuff once you are to write your scripts


nsurlconnection	nsoperationqueue---------------------------------------------------

others
right now all the photos are downloaded with a custom nsoperation class run on an nsoperationqueue .however i have heard about nsurlconnection async being more efficient and was wondering which is better of this situation


readr	tidyr---------------------------------------------------

others
we can use tidyverse extract from tidyr to split group into group and decision then replace the group value to 1 if the percentage extracted the number with parse_number from readr is greater than or equal to 90


mp3	speex---------------------------------------------------

others
speex is designed for speech and should perform better than wma mp3 or other audio codecs that are designed to handle music if you are just encoding speech which i assume since you are grabbing from the mic


valgrind	gprof---------------------------------------------------

others
so i can use neither gprof which isn t available on android valgrind which requires an older version of the ndk than what i m using nor the android-ndk-profiler which is for dynamic libraries loaded by android activities either java or native not plain executables

another important difference is that valgrind can report a lot more information than gprof does but that s not specifically related to using it


spaces	delimiter---------------------------------------------------

better pipe stringjoiner
create new string which will collect edited versions of each word you can use stringbuilder or better stringjoiner with delimiter set as one spaces

more than one spaces should be compressed to a delimiter pipe better


comma field regular
awk uses a comma surrounded by 0 or more spaces as field delimiter

the code makes some reasonable assumptions but it may fail to detect an escaped field if its doublequote is followed or preceded by more than 3 spaces before after field delimiter

it checks for one or more spaces as field delimiter and also tabs

your actual delimiter looks more like comma followed by a spaces to me

when you call pandas.read_csv you can use a regular expression that matches zero or more spaces followed by a comma followed by zero or more spaces as the delimiter

to split the string with regular expression saying spaces one or more spaces one or more as delimiter


tab command characters
besides the spaces there are more characters that are considered as delimiter by command prompt which are tab

if you want to allow for more delimiter than just spaces tab you can add additional separators when using split


s preg_split
instead of explode use preg_split and then use s+ s spaces + 1 or more times as delimiter

in this case i used one or more spaces as a delimiter s+


punctuation part words
by something fancier i m referring to more delimiter than spaces grammar punctuation etc

the pattern in scanner is supposed to be a regular expression that describes all the characters you don t want included in a token repeated one or more times this last part is because the words may be delimiter by more than one spaces punctuation etc.


tabs complex alternative
the alternative is to write slightly more complex c code which can split on either spaces or tabs note that you can pass strtok more than one delimiter

as you see i too mistrust whether the tab chars are real tabs and also use two or more spaces as delimiter

if you want to allow the integers to be delimiter by more than one spaces for indentation purposes or so and depending on the way you want to handle tabs and other non-newline whitespace you can use a more complex delimiter


others
to accept only a single spaces as a delimiter would require more finesse

however i need the delimiter to be any amount of spaces that are greater than one

note that rf takes more than two spaces as delimiter see but one spaces is not enough

if you want to print a list delimiter by spaces here is a more flexible solution that can support any number of elements

i admit i only skimmed the rfc link but it looks like more than one spaces can be used as a delimiter so you might want to change those to +

that is it looks for 2 or more spaces as a delimiter

i m using either | or one or more spaces as the delimiter

moreover i cannot use more than 2 spaces as a delimiter when using sed since sometimes there would be only one spaces between the item name and the second column like in the last line in the example between c and 5

you could split with spaces as delimiter and you split one more time with as delimiter

match using two or more spaces as a delimiter

this is happening because i am trying to separate out the search terms based on spaces since spaces comes more natural to users then comma separation or pipes or any other delimiter

by wrapping the - in spaces the delimiter is less likely to be tripped up and there s no need to trim the result

if you know that no value contains consecutive spaces and all values are separated by at least 2 spaces then you can get by with a single repl that replaces 2 or more spaces with a delimiter

one cannot assume that more than one spaces is delimiter

as luiggi mendoza commented splitting by s+ instead of would resolve any issue with the number being delimiter by more than one spaces

i have a string from input that i would like to only split into two parts with the delimiter as a spaces even though a spaces may occur more than twice

splits strings with two or more spaces as delimiter

the -match operation removes those lines that don t start with an sha1 hash and the -replace operation collapses adjacent spaces into a single delimiter so that convertfrom-csv won t create empty fields when there is more than 1 spaces in a row

in order to avoid matching empty strings by including spaces as delimiter it makes more sense to me to allow them and use a call to trim to get rid of them


file text character
basically you split the string into an array using a spaces character as a delimiter so we can get an array of each word then reverse that array and join them back into a string with the spaces we removed earlier

so i repeat and clarify my question from the heading how would i split the byear column into three or more columns with or spaces as delimiter

a file with space-separated values is just a dialect of the classic comma-separated values csv file where the delimiter is a spaces followed by more spaces which can be ignored

this method can handle more delimiter than spaces by the regex being used

so by using s 3 i am telling the csv processor that the columns in a row are delimiter by more than 3 spaces

you are using the wrong delimiter since your text file may contain more than one spaces character between tokens

since the file which has to read in have more than one spaces as the delimiter between some of the column the above method does not work

but i think importing the text file into excel delimiter by spaces is quicker if this can be done

it replaces all tags with spaces and str.split splits resulted text by one or more spaces as delimiter


xapian	whoosh---------------------------------------------------

others
xapian is slightly more difficult to setup but is much faster than whoosh


fadein	removeclass---------------------------------------------------

others
for some reason fadein works better than show or simply removing a hidden class via removeclass if you take that approach

that s because removeclass is executed faster than fadein method you can remove the class when animation is complete


changelistener	listeners---------------------------------------------------

others
if you have more than 1 changelistener and at the same time no mapchangelistener setchangelistener registered on your property the listeners wont be executed


bugsense	acra---------------------------------------------------

others
acra is one of them another that i frequently use is bugsense there are more also but i think these two will be perfect for you


webkit	blink---------------------------------------------------

others
i had heard that webkit safari ditched its css variables implementation and this was confirmed with the following two posts email page and webkit.bugs.org feature removed css variables - this was due to bad initial implementation code as well as the css variables webkit developers focusing more on google s blink performance


superclass	subclassing---------------------------------------------------

specific general arguments
superclass defines more general features of the objects of its subclassing

however you can t use a superclass value where a subclassing is expected because the subclassing is more specific

it looked weired to me that you are trying to return a subclassing s instance from a superclass s method since superclass usually means a more general concept

technically the subclassing tend to be more specific and the superclass are more generalized

so what this says is that provided your subclassing doesn t have any more values than the superclass used to determine ordering implementing is reasonable

when your instructor was talking about methods being overwritten i suspect they actually said overridden - where a subclassing can provide a more specific implementation of a method than a superclass or indeed may provide one where the superclass only has the abstract method declaration

if you subclassing has less arguments than a superclass and you could make them optional in the superclass just add placeholders in the subclassing

here having a superclass makes more sense or at least having a realnumber subclassing of number

i noticed that often times i do not clearly know whether a superclass of a number of subclassing should be more general or more restricted regarding the attributes

i know you can add values attributes behaviour that aren t in a superclass to a subclassing to make it more task specific

the general problem is that the subclassing is more specific than the superclass

i then break down that superclass into subclassing that are more specific to the objects they represent

however they are not the same because the subclassing has more specific functions and data members that accomplish a more specific task that the superclass

with explicit superclass calling your subclassing can accept more or fewer arguments than its superclass and can decide itself what to pass when calling the superclass

the other way round returning a subclassing that is a more specific class does not break the contract because the subclassing has at least the same functionality as the superclass

subclassing must allow more than the superclass not less and going from an argument being optional to not optional is allowing less

if the subclassing is more specific then it might fill in all by 2 of the arguments to its superclass __init__ method

whether one method s declared arguments are more specific than another subclassing are more specific than their superclass


others
this breaks the inherited and the subclassing is no longer an instance of the superclass

it turns out as i now think i understand that whatever method is called on sc will be searched for in superclass at both compile-time and run-time unless subclassing has provided a better version of the method

in the subclassing you might need to add code to en- decode the properties of the subclassing and call super to consider also the properties of the superclass

no subclassing can be more accessible than its superclass

more mathematically you can think of a class a set of all objects with some similar characteristic and then the subclassing surrounds the superclass and has even more characteristics

in enhanced er modelling subclassing inheriting from more than 1 superclass is called multiple inherited

still you cannot inherited from a as superclass cannot have a lower visibility than subclassing

take note of this there is no way to subclassing more than one superclass at a time

the fact that the subclassing is more selective only actually writes about what it writes is new functionality especially in light of the fact that the superclass promises nothing

say all instance variables are 32-bit ints for simplicity if the superclass has 3 and the subclassing adds 2 more then each instance of the subclassing will allocate 5 x 4 20 bytes -- 8 for its own instance variables plus 12 for the instance variables of the superclass

subclassing collections is dangerous because for example you don t know whether or not addall delegates to add inside the superclass this is explained further in effective java p.71

yes but if you think of your diagram as a topographic map the subclassing have higher altitudes than the superclass

hence your subclassing is accepting less classes than the superclass contract promises

there are tons of subclassing of a a tool generated the skeleton thus i want to create a superclass to make it easier for me to test

use a singletable strategy and if you thing one of the subclassing has more number of fields and need a separate table then mark that subclassing as a secondarytable using secondarytable annotation and use primarykeyjoin there is an annotation for this to join with superclass on pk column

a requirement that the constructor in the superclass runs before any code in the constructor of the subclassing keeps things simpler

usually i subclassing the stock cocoa classes customize to my needs and if i need custom methods in more than one subclassing i will declare a category on the superclass rather than relying on inherited to provide my custom behavior

the superclass has a more stringent constraint on a property content blank false than the subclassing content nullable true and i am using tableperhierarchy false

watch out you can t query a superclass if you have more than 1 subclassing then something like in jql

it not subclassing because subclassing inherited properties of superclass and add some more

here a type gives the alternative subclassing a a relative weight of 1 over the alternative superclass b making a more specific than b

problem being i have more than one subclassing to my superclass and many instances of each subclassing


specialized interface coupling
if you are going for an inherited approach you should keep in mind that subclassing should be more specialized than their respective superclass

i believe this solution is superior in general to the forward declaration because you re eliminating some tight coupling between your superclass and your subclassing and making a more generic interface besides

superclass creates an user interface while subclassing should create a more specialized version

generally subclassing have more specialized purposes than their superclass as a result


better variables structure
i have a class structure in java where one class extends another and the subclassing can have more variables than the superclass does

however i don t want to reproduce these classes in every sub-project without a good reason and i can t see how subclassing would make anything better the superclass would still be against the 2.3.3 version of

most likely it ll still be tightly linked with implementations generally a bad thing or if not bad it s not especially good but i think a structure like this is better than a superclass figuring out what all of its subclassing are

base class or superclass vs subclassing are better terms imo

secondly if you want the superclass variables to be accessible by your subclassing it s better to use protected than public

if i have a bunch of fields in a parent class that all need to be inherited by subclassing is it better to have the subclassing nested in the superclass make the fields protected rather than private or use protected accessor

better than modifying superclass output would be to modify the superclass so that the subclassing can provide the appropriate shape name


restrictive post func
even in your original post the subclassing is actually more restrictive than the superclass so doing something like

this issue would make sense if it wasn t a constructor as if it were a regular func you could potentially pass in a type that is expected in the superclass but that has been overridden in the subclassing to be more restrictive


specific type relationship
if i have a class hierarchy in which subclassing require use of more specific types than those specified in the superclass ivars is it better to declare the superclass ivar as id or to type it and then cast where necessary in the subclassing

for example you want to use abstract-class in such a case that each of the subclassing is a more specific type of its abstract superclass fruit apple orange banana grape strawberries etc. and you want to use non-abstract superclass in a relationship such as dad and son


methods method access
2 since superclass is smaller than subclassing one should use memory object carefully

a subclassing is more flexible and is treated as an entire object which responds to all superclass methods plus it s own

on the other side when hiding a static method the static method from subclassing that hides the static method from superclass can allow more but not less access than the hidden method

this gives you more flexibility than subclassing because with subclassing you are automatically inheriting all the methods in the superclass which is far more restricting than simply using some of the methods of another class

first of all wouldn t that relate to it returning an object that is a superclass which contains less data than requested because a superclass is not a subclassing but a subclassing is a superclass

if new member fields are declared in the subclassing then yes a subclassing presumably uses more memory since it has all the fields declared in the superclass plus all the fields declared in the subclassing

in other words if a subclassing is more accessible than its superclass then the access modifier of the superclass loses effect

many of the libgdx and android classes are designed this way they implement a bit of functionality but expect subclassing to implement more and the subclassing is expected to invoke the superclass method

these relations naturally arise when you impose restrictions on what you can handle--then if a subclassing means that the method can handle less acts as a superclass of since can handle everything that the subclassing can handle and more

shouldn t a subclassing interfaced be able to take in more than the superclass interfacec and use the same method

imagine your superclass has an object member but in your subclassing this is now more defined to be an integer

furthermore since at least in java you can only have the access modifier for an overwritten method to allow more but not less access than the superclass method you are still gonna drag either protected member variables or protected getter and setter all the way up in your subclassing

if you cast the subclassing to the superclass then the public methods on the subclassing are no longer visible

you can t cast a superclass in a subclassing because the subclassing may have a bigger interface than the superclass means the subclassing can have functions like getunixtimestamp that the superclass doesn t have

i always think of it as b having more stuff in it then a subclassing often have more methods than superclass hence b gets the wide end of the arrow and a gets the pointy end

creating a subclassing should mean more than just a convenient way to call superclass methods

on the contrary since a subclassing inherited all public methods of its superclass the subclassing are definitely bigger

in general instances of subclassing may be larger than those of their superclass so you should not expect the subclassing to fit into your vector s slot

you can override a method in a subclassing to add more functionality to what the superclass has

the subclassing overridden method cannot have weaker access than superclass method

you cannot have a subclassing with less methods than a superclass

so i inspected the compiled firebasemessagingservice which was the subclassing of com.google.firebase.iid.zzb and had zzae intent method as private but its subclassing firebasemessagingservice had protected access i know that subclassing cannot have weaker reference than its superclass so i guess there is something wrong with firebasemessagingservice library

however if the subclassing returns a narrower subtype of the superclass method return this is called a covariant return type and is allowed in java since jdk 1.5

if we are creating an object of a subclassing and invoking the method of superclass and if subclassing extends more than one class which superclass method should be called

similarly as the subclassing gains more methods it inherited the list of superclass in the order in which they were named that precede it

in this case superclass is bigger than subclassing that s why the second statement is correct


complex implementation worst
for my understanding the superclass is always smaller less complex then the subclassing

as you mentioned if superclass implementation changes then subclassing can break or more worst - will do unintended things silently

subclassing which implement more complex state should call the superclass s implementation and apply their state to the result if this basic state is to be saved


xmltype	clob---------------------------------------------------

others
a clob is a safer way to handle the soap request than an xmltype because the data returned may be longer than 32767 bytes

if you are storing varchar type data you should really be using one of the latter two types clob if you are storing various varchar data and xmltype which is a more specific type of clob anyway if you are storing strictly xml data

xmltype is being stricter about the validity than clob


jmeter	blazemeter---------------------------------------------------

others
why blazemeter is better than jmeter

for load testing jmeter is better option but you have quite enough funding then go for loadrunner neoload rational performance tester and for cloud try blazemeter


qpainter	qwidget---------------------------------------------------

others
if you are already doing the rendering elsewhere as a qpixmap and just want to draw the result subclassing qwidget and drawing it in the paintevent using qpainter may be simpler


bullet	sfml.net---------------------------------------------------

others
i try to make shooter game on c# with sfml.net but i can t imagine how to make an ability to shoot more than 1 bullet because now i have just one null-object of bullet-class and when player presses space key this object gets link to the new bullet


phpstorm	rubymine---------------------------------------------------

others
webstorm + pycharm + rubymine + phpstorm though to be fair rubymine has more features than radrails atm


ecto	elixir---------------------------------------------------

others
fortunately ecto 2.1 has a better alternative since it s supports the built-in calendrical types from elixir 1.3


asp.net-mvc	html.actionlink---------------------------------------------------

others
i am using asp.net-mvc 2 and i see more than one html.actionlink method that takes an idictionary as a parameter for the html attributes


hash	md5---------------------------------------------------

larger sha1 faster
hash ids are usually shorter than typical hash created by cryptographic hashing algorithms such as md5 or sha-256 and unlike these hash ids are usually reversible meaning we can decode the original value

it doesn t even matter much what algorithm is used - one could even use md5 or md4 and the passwords would be just as safe there is a slight difference because computing a sha-1 hash is slower

according to moore s law computers are becoming exponentially faster hence computing hash functions becomes much cheaper in terms of time especially quick hash functions like md5 or sha1

you may want to use the rabin hash which is faster and more collision resilient than cryptographic hash such as md5 sha1 et al

also the hash algorithm itself is much slower than sha1 md5 sha1 md5 are made for speed - not a useful property when storing passwords

even if you think an int hash isn t such a good idea using a 32 chars digest sha-1 md5 should be much faster for selects than the raw string right

as you see md2 is also much much shower than the other hash â the same outcome as with the php code but md5 is much faster than sha-1 and overall it took less time in delphi to do the same on the same machine as php

i think i understand the purpose of using sha1 as it s supposed to require more cycles than md5 to hash unhash and the salt is supposed to prevent the use of rainbow tables

now personally i generally use a salt sha-256 hash on my passwords because i thought that md4 and md5 were no longer secure and that hashing a password multiple times would just put too much strain on a server for no practical benefit

hashlib is new for 2.5 so if you must use an earlier python your hash choices are the older md5 and sha modules.

use hash and choose hashing algorithm that suits you well if possible something stronger than md5 but don t go all the way to sha512 either

if the hash function is more complex and cryptographically strong md5 or sha1 then it is theoretically not possible

any hash function like md5 sha1 sha256 etc obviously cannot be 100 unique - because they have a fixed length and due to the there must necessarily be non-unique results for input content that is larger than the hash

valid choices for hashing include sha1 or md5 although sha1 is preferable because it produces a larger hash and is considered cryptographically stronger than md5

the difference between crc32 and md5 is that md5 generates a larger hash that s harder to predict

finally sha1 hash are safer than md5 i tell you that because you used the md5 tag in your post


others
if the md5 from your select query results in a hash that is larger than the last record in your table you might get no records from the query

if not md5 would also be suitable for this purpose since you are concatenating the bucket and path and using the hash to provide better key distribution not uniqueness so you have no hash-collision concerns

if you want to do this - and are in-fact okay with having more larger hash data to store compare - you would be much better advise to simply run a different hash function other than md5 that is either more secure and or uses a larger number of bits

assuming equidistribution of md5 if you have n urls hash and add one more then there are n possible outcomes how it would collide and 64 6 - n how it would not collide

hashing is one way you can prove this to yourself by taking an md5 or shasum of a large file since the file s size is larger than the hash output by pigeonhole principle hash can t be restored.

5 generate much larger random numbers and hash them using md5 to get a smaller numeric value we should rarely get collisions but i end up with larger than needed numbers again

at best it is a computationally expensive hash function like whirlpool that for example is five times slower than md5 and thus allows only a fifth of the number of hash operations in opposite to md5

you can for example store a hash stored with something stronger than md5

to give more of a guarantee of uniqueness a stronger hash function such as md5 would be more ideal but just has the slight inconvenience that the resulting hash codes are too wide to store in a primitive

murmurhash has 64 and 128-bit versions so you can experiment between the two and it s faster than md5 largely owing to md5 being a cryptographic hash function whereas murmur doesn t have the added expense complexity of being cryptographically secure i m assuming that you re not concerned about anybody attempting to intentionally generate hash collisions or anything like that

bigger hash mean a larger set of possible hash for the same input set so a lower chance of overlap but until processing power advances sufficiently to make brute-forcing md5 trivial it s still a decent choice for most purposes

md5 is no longer secure and it can be broken with a good gpu no typo you can use your graphics card to break a hash

you also need to make sure that your database does indeed have the right data for the username password that the password was indeed hash using md5 more about your use of md5 below and under passwords that they re of the correct type and their lengths long enough

md5 provide more collision than sha which mean someone can actually get same hash from different word but it s rarely

the hash cake generates are more complex than md5

if you want to compare you re better off putting your result through getstring and compare the much less secure hash even less secure than md5 already is

if you don t need the cryptographic properties then a non-cryptographic hash or a hash that is less cryptographically secure md5 being broken doesn t prevent it being a good hash nor still strong enough for some uses is likely to be more performant

i would like to apply a hash code solution on my webpage which is more compact than md5 and sha-1 because i want to use them as keys in a json hash table

but if you still wish to figure out the phpbb password encryption hash it is no longer md5 in version 3.0 or higher and is a custom hash

of course any hash algorithm is going to have some chance of collision but you have better options than md5 that would still satisfy the 1024-byte limit

obviously md5 is much more difficult to reverse even in this anything that will hash to the right value sense then a simplistic algorithm like take the last two digits


easier better
sha is better hash than md5

using md5 would make it easier to crack a hash though


better faster functions
specifically if this input from untrusted users and they should not be able to trigger hash collisions use a more secure algorithm than md5

in the case of cryptographic hash functions like md5 it is even worse

you didn t elaborate on that point but if you were simply looking for a more secure algorithm than md5 take a look at hash coupled with an algorithm like sha512

murmur3 hash are faster then md5 but may not be suitable for cryptographic uses

better hash functions md5 are slower

of course calculating a md5 or sha hash is much slower than calculating a crc32

if you want the fastest encryption algorithm then there s no substitute for testing it yourself - somewhat strangely php s sha1 implementation is significantly faster than its md5 i know these are hash - this is to illustrate that performance depends on implementation as much as algorithm

however some of them like md5 have less possible hash and execute faster

my sense is that encode and decode are probably good solutions when you want the data to be recoverable but that unrecoverable hash using crypt md5 is a better approach for stored passwords

as pointed out md5 is not a very secure hash there are much better ones to use sha256 is pretty good still i think bcrypt is even better for some definition of better .

in that case some hash functions are somewhat faster than other md5 being one of the fast functions but md4 is faster and it is simple enough that its code can be included in any application without much hassle

the fact that bcrypt produces hash slower than md5 because of security reasons is also clear for me

for security md5 is not the best method hash is much better

all hash functions have that problem but some are more robust than md5

with a salt md5 is much more secure than without but you re better off using one of the sha hash such as sha256managed

thirdly use a better hash than md5 for passwords

this generally uses a hash algorithm that is much faster than md5

crypt with hash is simply more expensive than md5

the wrapper uses these in such a way that even the md5 implementation is significantly more secure than a simple hash

yes sha1 is a better hash than md5

if your php installation is too old even salt hash with md5 are better than two-encrypted password

using a non-reversible hash such as md5 is much more secure and you can store the hash value as clear text

other hash functions such as sha-1 also have hash collisions although it is much less likely than md5

and instead of md5 you are better off using either sha256 or bcrypt hash

however if you want to use the sha256 hash alogorithm which is better than the md5 then here s a code sample


proven breakable truncating
now whether you d be better off truncating the sha-1 hash or using a shorter hash such as md5 i don t know

mac os x llvm gcc based crypt fuction is borked junk hardwired to only use des a proven breakable hash worse than md5

sha-256 uses 64 characters in the database but with an index on the column that isn t a problem and it is a proven hash and more reliable than md5 and sha-1


second 100kb version
so if it takes 1 second to generate each hash it becomes a bigger time sink than it would have been had you used a fast hash such as md5 of a version of sha

it is likely that you could do an sha hash of 100kb in well less than 10 second though and though sha-1 is still theoretically flawed it is of higher strength than md5


password longer better
or you could employ a request signing scheme in which certain request fields are hash together with the password of the user basically sending the password without sending the password similar to digest authentication but you can use something better than md5

if you are in a situation where it is possible that an adversary might decide to sit down and create a load of messages with specified crc32 hash to mimic other messages or just to make a hash table perform very badly because everything hash to the same value then md5 would be a better option

the hash idea should work minor note that sha-256 wouldn t present collisions md5 is no longer secure but it depends on the trade-off if the service involves something really really critical a client-side ssl certificate would be the best way to proceed

then you run that string through a good hash algorithm--something like sha1 is fine even md5 is more than adequate despite reports to the contrary

so i guess it s the md5 in the dump output cause the conflicts and the hash value is longer than md5 outputs

sha1 is better than md5 because it is a longer hash so can accept more values without collisions although collisions are still possible

then when testing the password for correctness you hash it the same way and then compare the results -- sha1 is a common hash for this md5 is better than nothing


nsmutablestring	nsstring---------------------------------------------------

others
all-in all the reason is that nsmutablestring is able to do more things than nsstring and can do anything nsstring can hence the direction of inheritance

note also that using nsmutablestring is more efficient than creating a new nsstring each time a letter is added

nsstring is more general as it leaves you the oppertunity to create another subclass of it that could add the altering functionality without using the nsmutablestring s implementation why ever you would want that to do


systemtap	perf---------------------------------------------------

others
perf standard tool dtrace supported only in some linuxes have license problems - cddl incompatible with gpl stap systemtap works better with red linuxes like centos


config	ini---------------------------------------------------

others
it is similar to incron however config uses a simpler to read ini file instead of a plain text file

if you intend manual config it s probably better to choose something else for example ini

i like that ini is more for config purposes but with todays interest in json it seems more logical for the config be designed with json in mind

since json can store arrays i can create quite complex config with it and it parses faster than ini files

because spring s xml config is slightly more powerful than shiro s ini spring users are encouraged to use full spring config instead of shiro ini

does anyone have a suggestion on how we could use an ini or have a better suggestion for creating build config files

personally i am not a big fan of xml config files yaml json and ini being seen as more friendly


simpler script options
ini is really a much simpler format than xml if you have less than fifty config options and they are not nested

being php parseing it is nearly eg the file needs to be opened closed etc as fast as having the code at the top of each script and much faster than ini and xml config solutions


ocl	uml---------------------------------------------------

others
eclipse ocl provides a much stronger ui and an ocl2java code generator so that ocl embedded in ecore uml provides much more acceptable executable code


rubygems	rvm---------------------------------------------------

others

newer enough production
you could now use rvm to uninstall the older versions of rubygems in your system and only keept the latest ruby version

if you need it for a production system rvm is already seen as mature enough to maintain rubygems updated with newer versions

something else simpler you could try is to force rvm to reinstall the older version of rubygems and then update it again if required


achartengine	mpandroidchart---------------------------------------------------

others
achartengine is easy to use mpandroidchart has more option but is less easy to use than achartengine


unicorn	webrick---------------------------------------------------

others
i ve also found unicorn to be faster than webrick especially in production applications and apps running on heroku

unicorn is supposed to be faster than webrick


better performance development
in production it is much better to use a more sophisticated server like phusion passenger or unicorn since they have better performance than thin mongrel or webrick

my personal experience is that webrick is faster in my development environment than unicorn and thin os x in a pretty big rails app lots of gems routes etc


ecobertura	eclemma---------------------------------------------------

others
also forgot to mention junit testing framework and a great eclipse plugin eclemma for code coverage much better than cobertura ecobertura and easier to use and of course you can try maven as the other post mentionned or try ant as build tool

the eclemma plugin is nicer and more mature then ecobertura


ami	rightscale---------------------------------------------------

others
rightscale which was mentioned earlier as an ami provider in chantheman s tutorial is one of them but you can have a look at enstratus and scalr as well disclaimer i work there


wildfly	glassfish---------------------------------------------------

others
also note that for example glassfish and jboss wildfly are more than just a servletcontainer they also supports jsf ejb jpa and all other java ee fanciness

a time ago i change glassfish to wildfly it works better than glassfish but i m having some problems with this exception

my target is wildfly but glassfish documentation is better so i figured i would start there


strtol	getline---------------------------------------------------

others
also your get_int would be better written with fgets or getline if available and strtol


case-sensitive	case-insensitive---------------------------------------------------

others
btw a case-sensitive search done with removing i is much faster than a case-insensitive search

this tiny overhead on add is vastly outweighed by the savings on lookups since all programmers should know and understand that case-insensitive compares are vastly slower than case-sensitive especially with unicode - the cpu can t just do a block compare of data but must check each pair of characters specially even using a table look-up this is vastly slower


firebird	dbisam---------------------------------------------------

others
something like textolution s proprietary add-on for firebird looks like it could accommodate constructing single complex nested query that would apply both regular and fulltext criteria but dbisam does it more elegantly


http.sys	httplistener---------------------------------------------------

others
and also don t forget - http.sys much more customizable than httplistener


floating-point	fixed-point---------------------------------------------------

accuracy matlab arithmetic
but another added benefit of this approach is that it could make your program run faster since fixed-point integer arithmetic is much faster than floating-point arithmetic

if you need more than integer accuracy but want to avoid floating-point consider using fixed-point arithmetic instead

it s not necessarily true that the matlab fixed-point arithmetic provides less precision it can be used to provide more precision than ieee floating-point types


others
floating-point calculations are more expensive time-wise than fixed-point which is why fixed-point remains popular in microcontrollers and embedded systems

0- less than floating-point less than lt fl for fixed-point compare

armv7 is usually better but for arm fixed-point arithmetic is usually a lot faster than floating-point implementations

anthony williams fixed-point maths library provides a complete analogue of the standard maths library for a fixed data type that is typically around 5 times faster than software floating-point on the same target


exponents addition exact
addition happens to be exact in fixed-point as long as it does not overflow but fixed-point multiplication is no more exact than floating-point multiplication

fixed-point can be much more exact than floating-point as long as the number s exponents remain in range


primes	modulus---------------------------------------------------

factors rsa different
hypothesis the first n powers of two each have a different modulus when divided by p where p is the smallest primes that is larger than n

it is perfectly possible to use rsa with a modulus n that is composed of more than two primes factors p and q but two things have to be noted


better convincing collision
someone else in this thread makes a somewhat convincing argument that modulus a primes is better for detecting bit-swapping

it would be better to use a large primes as the modulus and get much better collision resistance


others
some of the random values that you are encrypting are greater than the modulus of the key the modulus is the value of the 2 primes in the rsa key multiplied together which means values wrap-around if you set you will see that input and output always match

however strong primes do not protect against modulus factorisation using newer algorithms such as lenstra elliptic curve factorization and number field sieve algorithm


g-wan	lighttpd---------------------------------------------------

others
even lighttpd or nginx with natively pre-compiled c++ is slower than g-wan s c scripts


maven	cargo---------------------------------------------------

overkill serious better
section 4.13 of better builds with maven describes using cargo to deploy a war specified using maven coordinates but that s serious overkill given that we re using jetty

section 4.13 of better builds with maven describes using cargo to deploy a war specified using maven coordinates


others
you could also use apache cargo which is more general than the tomcat maven plugin


redeclaration	ivar---------------------------------------------------

others
this redeclaration allows a cleaner way to access and mutate the property internally without resorting to fragile ivar synthesis which is becoming an antiquity now that the compiler does it for you


tapestry	stripes---------------------------------------------------

others
and beware that in this area there are many much more alternatives or fragmentation than in .net some more oriented to the mvc pattern struts struts2 stripes spring mvc some more component-based jsf tapestry wicket and some others gwt


twig	smarty---------------------------------------------------

others
then again smarty 2 is years old v3 has been with us for years and twig is far more practical in the html5 age

supports javascript mason xbl xul rhtml scss python html ruby python3 xml sass xslt django html5 perl css twig less smarty node.js tcl templatetoolkit php

if you use twig which i like better than smarty - although i still prefer self-restraint+plain php most ide s that support django templating should work with it since the syntax is nearly the same


symfony template cleaner
if your in the market for a templating engine twig a new templating engine used by symfony is much better than smarty imho

either way i intend to use smarty partly because i have lots of experience with it and partly because its much more well documented and has much more functionality than blade and to me the syntax is slightly cleaner than twig although the template engine is not the point of this question really


matplotlib	scipy---------------------------------------------------

others
the scipy numpy matplotlib clan is much better at dealing with huge amounts of volume data than matlab or at least gnu octave in my experience


nuxeo	alfresco---------------------------------------------------

others
nuxeo is definitely more advanced in this because with its web interface you can customise almost everything but alfresco has other advantages


robotlegs	puremvc---------------------------------------------------

others
puremvc is generally much faster than robotlegs in terms of performance

carnigorm and puremvc are good choices but my personal opinion is that robotlegs is far easier to work with


cairngorm	puremvc---------------------------------------------------

others
puremvc is more invasive than cairngorm meaning that your code is heavily dependent on the framework you have to subclass implement the framework classes interfaces but that doesn t mean that cairngorm isn t


qtablewidget	qframe---------------------------------------------------

others
i have a qgraphicsview nested within a few widgets qframe and then in a qtab and i want to be able to drag-and-drop a qtablewidget which is within the qgraphicsscene onto a totally different widget - another qtablewidget which is much higher up in the window but not a parent


width	text-align---------------------------------------------------

size text center
when i specify text-align center for an element with a width that is less than the width of the text the text is aligned to the left edge of the content box and overflows the right edge of the content box

the has text-align center so the will be centred if the size of the is less than the width of the


greater nothing margin-auto
you just need to use text-align right on the labels with a width that is slightly greater than the label text as the text will be lined up at the extreme right end

margin-auto works for elements with a width that is less than the page width in this case the ul is taking the entire width so there is nothing to center text-align center for the ul and display inline-block are the solution in this case

but i don t need a perfect width even if the width is wider than the longest word it is ok as i will text-align center to enhance visibility

when i specify text-align center for an element with a width that is greater than the width of the text the text is centered within the content box of the element as expected

to text-align center the text inside a floated div the width of the width should be greater than the containing element


others
i have a bxslider which is full width of the page when theyre is not enough slides to make it slide i want the slides to center inside the wrapper i have tried using text-align center and margins etc but i still can t seem to get them to center as bxsliders wrapper width is alot bigger than the screen width


total box boxes
if the total width of the inline boxes is less than the width of the line box the direction and text-align properties control how the boxes are distributed inside the line box

when the total width of the inline-level boxes on a line is less than the width of the line box containing them their horizontal distribution within the line box is determined by the text-align property


h.264	h.265---------------------------------------------------

others
h.265 and vp9 are both better codecs in terms of compression efficiency than h.264 but are far less widely supported and take more cpu time

edit h.265 hevc is even better at compression 50 of h.264 size in some cases but support is not yet widespread so stick with h.264 for now

4- for comparison purposes between h.265 hevc and h.264 avc intra-prediction the total sae of a reconstructed picture by hevc should be less than avc


ncover	dotcover---------------------------------------------------

others
as of now i think dotcover and resharper combined are less expensive than ncover


xna	slimdx---------------------------------------------------

others
i m working on deciding between managed directx through ms api codepack slimdx library managed wrapper for directx xna managed wrapper++ for directx9 only or unmanaged directx 20 + extra development time

considering the lack of windows 8 love that xna is getting support being dropped apps won t be sellable on the app store -- i d go with slimdx -- it s better than xna anyway -- the only down side is that you can t make xbox apps with it


msisdn	sms---------------------------------------------------

others
if you want to be more secure you can send the sms s more often however there is a way to understand sim-card change this is for t-mobile and europe use i guess from within the app so that the user cant fool you by enetering sms for a different msisdn and then change to his her real msisdn sim card


pycharm	spyder---------------------------------------------------

others
nevertheless in many occasions i just want to prototype something fast and would like the console in pycharm to behave more like spyder s

i like the auto-complete feature of pycharm but from my experience it is slower than spyder


jboss	weblogic---------------------------------------------------

others
in weblogic and glassfish you ll be better inspired by deploying the native ibm jca resource adapter and creating jndi resources then referenced in the spring context as above in jboss a direct mq client bean declaration suits best as below

the problem i am facing is that in jboss tomcat it works fine.but as soon as i move my application to weblogic i get xif.createxmlstreamreader source

i am running an application on jboss 7 and weblogic 12 when i make a soap call on weblogic is more restrictive than jboss

if your application is self-sufficient i would recommend going for tomcat as jboss is much more resource intensive as well as weblogic moreover weblogic costs some money


bufferedreader	filewriter---------------------------------------------------

others
i have coded a routine to compute the cartesian product of different tables as in a database with the only exception that the tables are stored as files in my case and for computing the cartesian product i am using file i o for reading files i am using filereader coupled with bufferedreader and for writing files i am using filewriter coupled with bufferedwriter now as i am performing every computation externally in files i.e i compute the product as follows i take a row from file-1 which is table-1 in my case and concatenate it with every other row in file-2 which is table-2 in my case and write it to an external file which holds the result


jmeter	neoload---------------------------------------------------

others
for load testing jmeter is better option but you have quite enough funding then go for loadrunner neoload rational performance tester and for cloud try blazemeter


tunnel	packets---------------------------------------------------

others
tunnel udp packets is somewhat more difficult


temp	tmp---------------------------------------------------

others
it is better than c temp and c tmp though


keras	cntk---------------------------------------------------

others
it is similar in spirit to keras which is built as a high-level api on top of theano tensorflow cntk although the main difference is that lasagne implements only one backend allowing it to integrate more deeply with theano features


osx	yosemite---------------------------------------------------

others
it s true that the yosemite compatibility exists but i ve found that earlier mac machines does not have the propper hardware and you experience some lacks in memory and graphics when upgrading more than one osx


emacs	textmate---------------------------------------------------

others
i feel like emacs is so much better than textmate

textmate is a better emacs for macs though that won t help you with solaris


mocha	sinon---------------------------------------------------

others
sinon has good integration with chai for making assertions and i wrote a module to integrate sinon with mocha to allow for easier spy stub cleanup to avoid test pollution.

there are also things like chai and sinon that work well with mocha to allow for easier testing


rtp	rtcp---------------------------------------------------

others
the strange thing is that when streaming is done via rtsp unicast rtcp generates both sender reports and receiver reports but when streaming is done via rtp multicast only sender reports are generated

the f indicates an rtp profile where the timing of rtcp feedback is more relaxed


mousedown	mouseenter---------------------------------------------------

others
mouseenter event handler will cause duplicate handler when mousedown event fired once more

this would explain why in your case mousedown or click are slower than mouseenter which in a touch device happens as soon as you touch the element being monitored


strlen	strcpy---------------------------------------------------

convenient identical result
because of the above replace strdup with strlen malloc memcpy memcpy is slightly faster than strcpy

additionally if you have strdup then it is much more convenient than strlen + malloc + strcpy with identical result including the same obligation to free the allocated storage when you no longer need it


others
strcpy incoming connected will overwrite dataa and maybe datab if your first token pointed to by header is shorter than strlen connected

it s hard to guess whether this will really be slower or faster than using strcpy followed by strlen though

you must allocate one char more than the strlen for the terminating null character which will also be copied with strcpy

if strcpy is anything like strcpy it will write one byte more than strlen returns to zero terminate the string

but for the example you give it doesn t matter - if it s going to fail it will be in the initial strlen so strncpy doesn t buy you anything in terms of safety and presumbly strncpy is slower as it has to both check bounds and for nul and any difference between memcpy and strcpy isn t worth changing code for speculatively


textblock	itemscontrol---------------------------------------------------

others
which once again is closer to what i need as my itemscontrol is now stretching all the way as i ve set its and my textbox are still aligned to the textblock and are stretching all the way across but the problem now is that the textblock should be smaller as the column is set to auto but they appear to behave as if the column was set to and i guess i m losing the purpose of using issharedsizescope since it has been removed


ejml	jama---------------------------------------------------

others
ejml looks really good it works almost 2x faster than jama on my data.


profiler	perf---------------------------------------------------

others
a profiler gives you more detailed information which can help to diagnose and fix perf problems


flac	ogg---------------------------------------------------

others
i suspect the computational demands of flac decoding are probably considerably less than ogg and if dsp gets you excited taking the time to figure all this stuff out is 100 worth it even if the flash route possibly leads to disappointment


comment better wav
i also know that it can deal with flac better than wav and ogg

regearding your comment i also know that it can deal with flac better than wav and ogg that is not really the case


hide	scrolltop---------------------------------------------------

others
the scroll function hide the cart button if scrolltop is less than the height of the navigation bar

when scrolltop is less than 300 show the div otherwise hide it


nsorderedset	nsset---------------------------------------------------

others
when nsorderedset was added much more recently it had to deal with the existence of prior collections - primarily nsarray and nsset

is nsorderedset faster than nsset


bokeh	plotly---------------------------------------------------

others
i can do this in bokeh but i have other issues regarding interactivity which plotly manages better

bokeh allows standalone htmls but plotly will be an easier option for me


theano	tensorflow---------------------------------------------------

others
in my testing the slow-down from using tensorflow ranges from about 1.5-3.0 times slower than using theano but its performance will depend on your application

theano is still faster than tensorflow in many respects and supports a wider range of operations

i believe some other frameworks such as theano go farther than tensorflow in proposing deterministic operations

should i be surprised that the keras theano backend is about 18x - 19x slower than the keras tensorflow backend

it theano runs much faster than tensorflow


long-time graph computational
tensorflow is better at marketing itself than long-time players of the open-source market like torch and theano

tensorflow has better computational graph visualizations than theano and torch


d3.js	raphael---------------------------------------------------

brother fallback place
the only place where raphael defeats d3.js is fallback raphael supports older versions of ie where as d3.js is based on current web standards ie 9

this should be possible maybe be aware snap.svg isn t so compatible with older browsers in which case you could look at raphael which is snaps older brother d3.js is very well established as well

raphael supports older versions of ie whereas d3.js is based on current web standards


others
d3.js is much harder to learn than raphael but in both cases you will also have to learn svg to be able to create better animations

raphael is very much similar to d3.js but is more on thd lines of a graphics library and the added advantage of compatibility with internet explorer 6 through 8 using vml instead of svg.

on the other hand normally d3.js visualizations need less mathematics than the similar processing or raphael examples because there are many prepackaged layouts already

as it stands d3.js is not just better than raphael and processing in many cases but is also a viable replacement for jquery underscore.js and other frameworks

i am using d3.js with raphael to support the lower versions of internet explorer


quanteda	tidytext---------------------------------------------------

others
the quanteda package is faster and more straightforward than tm and works nicely with tidytext as well


procedure	ora-06502---------------------------------------------------

others
your problem is that your procedure has more parameters then you pass to it on mybatis call so at any point after the missing parameter you should have your ora-06502 pl sql numeric or value error error since the following paramters doesn t have the same type on the order you are passing it


summernote	fckeditor---------------------------------------------------

others
i know summernote does that but fckeditor is a more complete tool than summernote so i cant switch to that


pthreads	fork---------------------------------------------------

others
the features stemming from those discussions permit less extreme fork than processes which is symmetrically like the provision of more extensive independence between pthreads

multithreading is faster takes up less resources there is no separate namespace for it and you can run them 4 times more than the fork but multithreading requires build php with non-zts some extensions do not work with non-zts and requires something you would understand pthreads model

third since the question is tagged multithreading if the old process is running more than one pthreads then the new process inherits all the mutexes conditions etc of the old process in the state they were in when fork was called


processes better clone
but when is fork and clone better than pthreads

there is a nice comparison of threads and processes here when is clone and fork better than pthreads


xunit.net	fsunit---------------------------------------------------

others
i d rather use fsunit or fstest to write tests in f# it feels more natural than oo xunit.net style tests


lxml.html	beautifulsoup---------------------------------------------------

others
but if you are allowed to store whole tree into memory you can use lxml.html which is faster than beautifulsoup

you can do this with beautifulsoup s html parser though the lxml.html package is somewhat more straightforward

lxml.html deals with badly formed html better than beautifulsoup is actively maintained beautifulsoup isn t and is a lot faster since it uses libxml2 internally


heapsort	in-place---------------------------------------------------

others
heapsort can sort in-place and doesn t have the worst case quadratic behavior but on average is slower than quicksort in most cases

but heapsort is assumed to be on average somewhat slower than standard in-place quicksort

dr your heapsort is not faster because it isn t actually a heapsort it s a backwards insert sort followed by an in-place ordering reversal


armadillo	openblas---------------------------------------------------

others
armadillo doesn t prevent openblas from using more cores


awt	swing---------------------------------------------------

others
the keylistener is an older interface from the awt days its still ok to use it with swing but is more of a general listener

note first there is no combobox item in awt there is jcombobox in swing which is better to use than choice of awt

either is capable of doing it but swing is more modern and supports components jtree jtable .. and functionality double-buffering built-in key bindings plafs support for rich text that is missing from the awt apis

alternate way is to use awt - which is an older and worse technology than swing and in that case you can t use flowlayout - it puts all the components into one row

the awt approach seems closer to bare metal but since jdk 6 brought a lot of improvements in swing rendering pipeline i would go the swing java2d approach

i know you re thinking why did i use awt instead of swing but at the moment i am more comfortable with awt

the advantage of swing is that it has many more components available such as jtable and jlist which are more graphical and extensible than the components provided in awt allowing for more graphics-rich applications to be developed

awt was the first try on ui for java later swing provided a better alternative because they use light components the component draw the ui them selves instead of relaying on native code and those light components were way lot flexible and maintainable then awt

i mean by light weight i thought maybe the swing components occupy less memory than the awt components

i imagine this is caused by the awt layer which i understand is a primitive foundation for swing not understand swings more advanced events

also you re mixing up awt with swing - use more light-weight jcomponent instead of component

swing will save your more time than awt as all the code of components of swing are purely written in java whereas of awt code of components are written in native language that is other than java thus compilation time of awt is more than swing

swing has more or less deprecated awt so you should extend jframe instead of frame

awt is a thin layer of code on top of the os whereas swing is much larger

swing is a lightweight framework provided by java while awt relies more on native libraries and is considered heavyweight

use swing follow the threading rules which are hardly likely to be more onerous than awt and enjoy

instead of awt consider a more up-to-date means of representing your client such as swing and also deploy as a jframe based application on java web start

in general avoid awt for swing which has much greater power and flexibility although it too is showing its age just less so than awt

the swing library is much more portable than the awt library

performance swing components are generally slower and buggier than awt due to both the fact that they are pure java and to video issues on various platforms

swing is relatively similar to awt apart from the fact that swing has more capabilities awt is probably the simplest form to start out with and has most if not all of the tools to complete your project hope this helps


level bindings lower
as a general tip for swing typically use key bindings over the awt based lower level keylistener

for swing typically use key bindings over the awt based lower level keylistener


better components advanced
in swing has more features than the awt components

as already mentioned by others better to use swing over awt since swing is more advanced

i have a program an awt frame yes i know that swing is better but i am restricted from using it that has 2 moving objects

swing is better and few people remember how to use awt components

i personally would just skip using awt and move to swing which provides better built in functionality for this type of thing

i find that the swing library is easier to use than awt although you do still have to use awt for listeners

its was said that awt is faster than swing as it uses the platform component but due the arrival of faster processor etc ..

swing is far better then awt and should be educated to people who is writing gui-based java for the first time

well swing is richer in terms of out-of-the-box components than awt

it has functionality the same as a canvas but swing is more advanced and has better features than awt

generally swing is more efficient and advanced than awt

swing or javafx would be better than awt

the only problem is that we don t know what to use our very own engine with awt or if we could use swing to make it easier

swing has newer and better api s than awt

it seems unfortunately i am stuck using awt to do this assignment seeing as swing would be better

yes swing has newer and better api s than awt

you can read all over the web that awt is old and deprecated and swing is old but newer than awt and should be preferred over awt whenever possible

i haven t worked with awt much but swing is much better from the gui developer s point of view

nobody uses awt anymore because swing is much better

swing is far better than the obsolete awt library

consider using swing which has much better performance over the old heavyweight awt


useful
as far as when awt may be more useful than swing -

are there any cases where awt is more useful advised to use than swing or vice-versa


javafx alternative stylish
awt is really out of date people have more experience with swing no days and even javafx

i m doing a project at university which i decided to do in javafx as it is more stylish than swing but i m having difficulty to find an alternative to the filledoval library for the canvas awt as i can t use the canvas awt in javafx


flexible robust gui
consider creating a swing application not an awt application since swing apps are more flexible powerful and robust

use a swing gui not an awt gui since swing is much more powerful and flexible than awt

if you want to ditch the zero awt and get with the hero swing read more at creating gui with swing

also for my money i d create a swing gui not an awt gui as swing is much more robust and flexible

i suggest if possible that you not code in awt but rather code with swing which is much more robust and flexible


drawingarea	cairo---------------------------------------------------

others
i found another approach using the cairo context passed to the handler of draw events but it resulted in capturing a region of the parent window that was larger than the drawingarea


nsurlconnection	nsurlsession---------------------------------------------------

others
nsurlsession is much more powerful tool than nsurlconnection

nsurlsession also provides nicer interfaces for requesting data using blocks in that it allows you to combine them with delegate methods for doing custom authentication handling redirect handling etc. whereas with nsurlconnection if you suddenly realized you needed to do those things you had to refactor your code to not use block-based callbacks

nsurlsession is newer than nsurlconnection if you are using swift language then you can use your own custom methods by using nsurlsession or you can use alamofire

it s not my experience that nsurlsession is any slower than nsurlconnection is

the block-based methods of nsurlsession are richer than what was provided by nsurlconnection


feedparser	beautifulsoup---------------------------------------------------

others
you could use beautifulsoup - but feedparser is much better geared towards rss handing


behat	mink---------------------------------------------------

others
i would say behat + mink is more useful for that purpose

often especially when using mink to test web applications you will find that behat goes faster than your web application can keep up - it will try and click links or perform actions before the page has had chance to load and therefore result in a failing test that would have otherwise passed


nsis	uninstaller---------------------------------------------------

others
can a nsis section create more than 1 uninstaller


ocaml	sml---------------------------------------------------

others
more generally sml tends to be rather more elegant while ocaml has some more advanced features quirks and users

edit for those of you coming later i also learned that like sml in f# the order is specified and deterministic--unlike ocaml which is even more crazy considering how close the two are in syntax


mp3	flac---------------------------------------------------

others
it is a high level 2d and 3d cross platform windows mac os x linux sound engine and audio library which plays wav mp3 ogg flac mod xm it s3m and more file formats and is usable in c++ and all .net languages c# visualbasic.net etc

if a flac file is newer than the corresponding mp3 file or the corresponding mp3 file doesn t exist then i want to run a bunch of commands to convert the flac file to an mp3 file and copy the tags across


springlayout	grouplayout---------------------------------------------------

others
in it developers seem to agree that grouplayout is a more effective replacement of springlayout


metaphone	soundex---------------------------------------------------

others
edit double metaphone was specifically designed to be better than soundex and work in languages other than english

double metaphone - this algo will give you a better match than soundex at the cost of speed it is really good for spelling correction though

then i tried the metaphone function and it worked far better than soundex

general consensus including the php docs is that metaphone is much more accurate than soundex when dealing with the english language

in php you should use metaphone it is more accurate than soundex

looking at my code i also used a hash that was a soundex conversion of each word after stripping stop words etc though my comments note that metaphone would have been better i was using sql server so soundex was built in...


box2d	scene2d---------------------------------------------------

others
so basically when box2d is more about how objects will behave themselves during application running the scene2d is more about how you write your code before application running


jdom	dom4j---------------------------------------------------

others
in addition there are third-party libraries for xml manipulation which you may find more convenient such as dom4j suggested by duffymo or jdom


vtd-xml 10x tree
try vtd-xml it is much faster than jdom upto 10x and dom4j or dom and also memory efficient

you might find that other tree apis like jdom xom and dom4j are more to your liking

there are many tree representations of xml available in the java world jdom xom dom4j that are vastly more usable than dom


memcpy	memmove---------------------------------------------------

memory rusty answers
as an aside my c c++ is rusty but is not memcpy more efficient than memmove if you know you don t have overlapping memory

as already pointed out in other answers memmove is more sophisticated than memcpy such that it accounts for memory overlaps


others
note that the behavior of memcpy is undefined when the memory blocks overlap so memmove is more appropriate here

if you know buffers cannot overlap memcpy is fine and may in any given library use optimizations that allow it to be faster than memmove

note that memmove has more overhead than memcpy because it has to determine which direction of copying is safe

although in reality i find it hard to imagine the memmove could be faster than memcpy i don t discount the possibility

memcpy is more efficient than memmove. in general use memmove only if you have to

memmove on the laptop runs slower than memcpy but oddly enough runs at the same speed as the memmove on the server

in addition as mats petersson said memmove is cache friendlier than memcpy

however because of additional checks that memmove performs when the buffers are small and surely does not overlap memcpy is better

it is entirely possible that in most implementations the cost of a memmove function call will not be significantly greater than memcpy in any scenario in which the behavior of both is defined

while memmove will be only slightly slower than memcpy due to the assumptions it needs to make about the source and destination in memcpy they cannot overlap it should still be far superior to any standard loop


slower copy big
the memcpy to memmove which peforms faster

edit memmove is 2x faster than memcpy on the server

this means that memmove might be very slightly slower than memcpy as it cannot make the same assumptions

and it said memmove might be very slightly slower than memcpy

so memcpy can be faster than memmove

why is memcpy so much slower than memmove or hand rolled copy on the server

even i don t think the memmove can be faster than memcpy but there should be no big difference at least on intel platform

is it a microoptimization or are there real significant examples when memcpy is faster so that we really need to use memcpy and not stick to memmove everywhere

std memmove may be very slightly slower than std memcpy emphasis added because it has to first check whether the source and target ranges overlap

why does memcpy perform slower than memmove on my system

bad news is that the asmlib version of memmove is slower than the glibc version it is now running at the 300ms mark on par with the glibc version of memcpy

the question is about is there really any platform where memcpy is faster than memmove

memcpy is still a little bit slower than memmove

from reading other so questions such as this or this gives the impression that memcpy should work faster than memmove and intuitively this should be so

memcpy and or memmove will do it more generally and of course you can always write an element-by-element copy loop


short arm unalligned
on some arm platform im working on memmove was 3 times faster than memcpy for short unalligned load

so in what platform and how memcpy can be significantly faster than memmove if there is none why providing two similiar functions instead of just memmove and lead to a lots of bug


countif	named---------------------------------------------------

others
the roundabout method i ve employed is to create additional columns with a regular countif and counta formulae - in other words i count the number of countries a named has visited more than x times countif and then use the counta to sum the number of named in that column who have visited x times


interbase	firebird---------------------------------------------------

others
firebird was forked + - 18 years ago from interbase 6 which was opensourced for a short time since then it has diverged and firebird can no longer read interbase databases nor can interbase - as far as i am aware - read firebird databases more recent than firebird 1 or maybe 1.5


tstringgrid	tlistview---------------------------------------------------

others
i have just spent a lot of time working with tlistview in view style mode vsreport and i find it is even more limited than tstringgrid for example it provides no in-place edit support


vp8	ogg---------------------------------------------------

others
i suspect this is because the encoding ogg mp4 vp8 are better suited to forward playback


actionlistener	documentlistener---------------------------------------------------

others
create the text field and register the documentlistener to it...although i d be wary about using a documentlistener personally maybe a actionlistener and or focuslistener might be more suitable but hay

firstly i wouldn t use a keylistener to monitor changes to a text field a documentlistener would provide more useful information to the changes of the underlying field but an actionlistener would probably be more appropriate under these conditions


mapply	melt---------------------------------------------------

others
could i use mapply to do this more succinctly than running melt and dcast separately for each of employed girls guys


fgets	fgetc---------------------------------------------------

others
i used fleshgrinder s filter class to replace r with n in the stream see accepted answer and replaced fgets with fgetc to get more realtime access to contents of stdout

fgetc is a function to read a single char simpler than using fgets

if not multiple fgets calls will still be faster than multiple fgetc calls because the overhead of the latter will be greater


multiplying	subtract---------------------------------------------------

others
in other words hardly anything slower than multiplying add subtract but not enough to really worry about

if you have some binary floating-point values a and b that you know are very near decimal numerals with a few digits then multiplying those values by a power of ten subtract and dividing by the power of ten generally does not provide a better result than simply subtract the values directly

the logic is multiplying by 2 whole number 0.1 2 0.2 and if it s bigger than 1 subtract and continue

subtract is faster than multiplying

integer add subtract compare instructions but not multiplying are also lower latency than their fp counterparts

when you have multiple extents you can figure out on which extent the cluster is by multiplying the lcn with the size of a cluster and then subtract the size of each extent returned by the ioctl in the order they are returned if the next number to subtract is greater than your current number that particular lcn is on that extent

adding and subtract logarithms of factorials then taking the exponential at the end is more reliable than multiplying and dividing factorials directly

but my guess would be that in this particular chunk of code multiplying divide and modulo all take roughly the same amount of time and that time is greater than add or subtract

similarly if you skip the five first elements your loop takes o n-5 time but that too is the same as o n because adding or subtract a constant is even weaker than multiplying by a constant

to give multiplying and divide higher precedence than add and subtract you can do something like this example adapted from john levine lex yacc 2 e 1992

p is sometimes chosen to be 31 because not only is it prime but a compiler resolves it to a bitshift and a subtract which is much faster than a multiplying

the code is used to create a calculator that shall have functions like squaring rooting subtract adding multiplying dividing and more if i feel like is necessary in the future


parameter greater first
subtract first field from the other and if the value is not greater than 0 multiplying by -1

if the parameter is greater than 0.5 multiplying lambda by two and subtract one this maps onto and return the interpolated color between color b and color c


subtraction character higher
multiplying and divide have higher precedence than add and subtract

since multiplication has a higher precedence than subtraction you should subtract 0 to your digit character before multiplying it


glsurfaceview	renderscript---------------------------------------------------

others
both a renderscript and opengl are used for getting high performance graphics and animation s.but still opengl is the best option to get high performance graphics because it is well documented and you will have more control over the glsurfaceview .but in renderscript some of the classes are depreciated in the current versions .its almost not possible to make a rssurfaceview to transparent


wcf	openrasta---------------------------------------------------

others
building restful services with openrasta is much simpler than with wcf in my experience

is openrasta better than wcf


api web mature
openrasta is much more mature than wcf web api

though openrasta looks more mature than wcf web api i m still a bit confused


highcharts	nvd3.js---------------------------------------------------

others
for something more robust check out highcharts or d3.js or something built on top of d3.js like nvd3.js


datediff	difference---------------------------------------------------

others
you can then add datediff and a case statement to flag a new login where the difference is greater than your threshold

for me testing with a data set of 2508 records with dates evenly spread through a single year and joining the table to itself datepart performed significantly better than datediff the difference between datepart and month was negligable though datepart was typically 1ms faster

note that diffseconds can cause an overflow when the difference becomes larger than int32.maxvalue error the datediff function resulted in an overflow

you can use datediff between the column date and your current date and retrieve only the lines where the difference is less than 7 like

i ve using the datediff method to get the difference b w two dates obtained using the date yyyy mm dd hh mm ss function but getting the output 0 every time even when the difference is more than 1 day


greater period dates
generally you can use datediff to specify more narrow period if you would like this difference to be less than 10 days you could use

how to calculate datediff between two dates if difference is greater than 35 days


end difficult minutes
datediff becomes more difficult to use as you have more dateparts in your difference in your case looks like minutes and seconds

for example if the start time was 8 55 and the end time 9 05 datediff hour ... would return 1 although the actual difference is much less just 10 minutes


orientdb	neo4j---------------------------------------------------

slower small ti
using orientdb that is supposed ti be faster than neo4j for depth i m seeing a slow performance

i found that orientdb is too slow at least much slower than neo4j even on relatively small 150k datasets when searching records by text pattern despite the presence of indices


others
the number of requests orientdb could serve is consistently 3 to 5 times lower than neo4j

i read in some blog that orientdb performs at least as good if not better than neo4j while also offering more complex types like mongodb would

orientdb looks more fancy and advanced but not as popular as neo4j and is not supported on heroku

as you can see the neo4j result is way longer then the one from orientdb

in very short orientdb supports full replication while it seems neo4j does not natively but neo4j would be more widely adopted and has better documentation


vagrantfile	hosts---------------------------------------------------

others
aside from that you can also edit the vagrantfile to include more config files depending on hosts os


qdockwidget	qvboxlayout---------------------------------------------------

others
the center widget is a qdockwidget containing a qwidget with a qvboxlayout containing more stuff


vlookup	countif---------------------------------------------------

others
bear in mind that index is the same as vlookup in that it will only return the first value if two tenders finished on the same day it will only return the first it comes across if you have more than one maybe sumifs would work better maybe along side countif to show how many there were


ordereddictionary	sorteddictionary---------------------------------------------------

others
it might not be the most efficient way to do it but i ve used ordereddictionary though sorteddictionary is probably more appropriate for handling the out of order issue in the past


qthread	qobject---------------------------------------------------

others
finally consider that you can have more than one qthread as well as more than one qobject running on a qthread


namedtuple	dictionary---------------------------------------------------

others
on my system the three element namedtuple drops the per-item overhead to 72 bytes less than a third that of even the 3.6 dictionary and less than a sixth of a 3.6 ordereddict and three element namedtuple remains 72 bytes on 3.5 where dictionary ordereddict are larger pre-3.6

i believe a namedtuple would be more suited to this job than a dictionary

a dictionary would be a more common choice though and namedtuple is very neat as well

2 you probably want a namedtuple - i m pretty sure they re lighter than dictionary and you can access properties using dot notation for which i have an aesthetic preference anyway

as namedtuple lighter than dictionary

creating an instance of the namedtuple is easier than creating a dictionary

if you re really never defining any class methods a dictionary or a namedtuple make far more sense in my opinion

namedtuple have a lower overhead than dictionary since the duplicate keys don t have to be stored per item but have the convenience of named access


lists use overhead
using a dictionary or a namedtuple would be a better idea because then you wouldn t have to remember what each element in a tuple corresponds to does score come first or does id

namedtuple should perform better less overhead than dictionary if the lists are long

depending on your use case a dictionary might fit better than a namedtuple


memory instances tuples
namedtuple is faster and significantly more memory efficient than a dictionary

but it seems like using a namedtuple would be even better since they are more memory efficient than dictionary and your variables suggest you can use a fixed set of fields

namedtuple instances are just as memory efficient as regular tuples as they do not have per-instance dictionary making them faster than dictionary


integer	fractions---------------------------------------------------

others
as python integer is less limited than the float you may get bigger results with the fractions if it makes sense at all

if your numbers have no more than n fractions digits and can be scaled to integer you can multiply by 10 n and operate with integer instead

but for someone who doesn t even know what an integer is numbers without fractions values is probably clearer


larger format type
therefore ieee 754 single precision floating-point format has 23-bits fractions and int type has 32 bits so if the integer is larger than 2 24-1 the float type can t represent it exactly

i know there are not that many mantissa bits for fractions part for bigger numbers but you did not specify which floating data-type you are using if 32 64 80 128 256 bits or more so hard to say and if the integer part is bigger then your integral data-type used to cut off the non fractions part then you would be in trouble with f-long f

a floating-point format with a n-bit fractions can t represent the integer which is larger than 2 n+1 -1 because it will lose the precision

if the number of bits in the mantissa or fractions is larger than the number of bits in your integer type then you ll possibly lose precision when someone types in a number such as


result multiplication math
the reason i used it is because integer math and multiplication are faster than fractions math and division

the result of the multiplication is slightly less than an integer because the numbers are internally stored in binary and you can t represent most fractions numbers exactly in binary for the same reason 1 3 can t be written exactly in decimal with a finite number of digits after the decimal point

fractions exponents are considerably more difficult since it means essentially calculating an nth-root of the base where and multiplying the result by the result of the integer portion power calculation


conversion lower glfixed
the label s text size of an integer part is bigger than text size of a fractions part

if you divide a 15 digit number by 3 you lose one digit because the division may not make the integer part have fewer digits and it demands an extra digit for the fractions part

that means that the 16 upper bits of a glfixed represents the integer part and the fractions is the lower 16 bits divided by 65536

so my problem is how could i extract the fractions part from 254.73 so that i can get exact 73 as integer to do more calculations

those approach that you are using trys to make a number integer if a fractions part is less than 1e-6 0.000001

another example is geometry classes one parametrized to work with 64bit floats another parametrized to work with 64bit integers passing data between them may result both in rounding errors integer can t represent fractions and overflow integer has bigger value range than same-sized float

if a decimal fractions is included lower order time elements if any shall be omitted and the decimal fractions shall be divided from the integer part by the decimal sign specified in iso 31-0 the comma or full stop .

when you then calculate the integer part is 1 less that you might expect while the fractions part is slightly less than one

if fractions part was greater than 0.5 adding 0.5 to it will increase the integer part and after conversion we get 1 higher of the original integer part rounding up

than use bcpow on the integer part and bc_exp on the fractions part which now converges from the get-go since the fractions part is smaller than 1

so if the fractions part was less than 0.5 adding 0.5 will not increase the integer part and so after conversion the integer part will be the same rounding down


uiview	catransition---------------------------------------------------

others
the uiview class methods are convenience methods for common animations but are more limited than catransition


margin	height---------------------------------------------------

others
on page load detect if body s height is larger than window s height and if not move #header #content and #footer to the left via padding or via margin on the body

the problem with your logic is that it doesn t incorporate the maximum distance the child is allowed to move in the top direction it will jump in 50 pixel steps and in case the newly calculated child height is smaller than the parent it just stops where it would also need to limit the margin to the maximum similar to what you are already doing for the bottom direction

the only catch is that this logic of 1.33 times the header region height seems to work only if the header margin b footer margin is less than or equal to one-third the paper-height

the trick sets a big padding to all columns in this case 10000cm note it must be a number larger than the height of the tallest column and removes extra space with a negative margin

the margin will be greater than the height of the iframe

by default browsers add a margin to the body causing the body to actually take up more than 100 height 100 plus whatever the margin is

if boxes 4 and 5 are together higher with margin than box 3 it should be stretched in height so they are horizontally aligned as shown in my image

css height 100 gives an element height that is actually greater than 100 by the size of the margin

infact text inside text views has some internal margin that i took into account using the inset structure so the required text view height will be higher than the calculated string height

the issue is that without the margin on the bottom the page height is shorter then the window bounds thus your footer div ends and the body of the page bleeds through

so on b element i cannot use nor a negative margin because i don t know a block height nor position absolute because b content height might overflow wrapper height

it seems that that top margin gets added to the 100 height making it higher and causing the scrollbar

once the page height is less than the margin i need to create another page

you need to leave enough space whether by increasing the height of the footer using a minimum instead of fixed height using a smaller margin on the paragraph or some other means for your content to appear in

i used firebug to look at the divs and imgs and both imgs have 0 for margin padding and border yet the computed height somehow is 4.5px bigger in the first instance

when recyclerview s content height is less than itself - last item has to gain margin padding height and fill the remaining space

because you are using margin in tabs its height will be more thant 100

also you need to be careful about your content - in the fiddle you used h4 and p tags and these have a default top bottom margin set by the browser - if this margin is larger than the space available in the percentage height div it will push the content out of vertical alignment

i don t understand why the height of span element more than its font-size margin and padding 0 jsfiddle example

however an algorith could be something like if the new margin top is greater than the height of the current note and the difference between the offet of the current note anchor and the following note anchor is less than the height of the current note than subtract the height of the current note from the new margin

i have use height 100vh for .container and pulled .footer up by minus margin

i am trying to make my div wrap the tag however it doesn t wrap the height is always higher of my div and my tag has no padding or margin i tried many things but doesn t work i am adding my style and the html code i am also going to add some screenshots

note this looks good because you have defined your height making the smaller ones exactly twice as high with margin as the bigger one

i can handle this using outside position property modifying the margin or padding of an li element if the text height is smaller than the image height

try to align the margin of image to be in the left of stackpanel and the rectangle height should be less than the image height.try to reduce the corner radius of rectangle this also helps

pstenstrm has provided a good solution that appears to display correctly however the actual height of the red div in this case is equal to its children the text rather than the remaining available space of its parent while the inner and outer height take up more space due to the padding margin

also be aware that if the height of the printable area that is page height minus top and bottom margin is less than the height of your cell content then it s impossible for the browser to avoid breaking it unless it can somehow warp the fabric of space maybe firefox has a -moz- property for that

the width and height are little less because my printer doesn t support zero margin


window fixed calc
i removed fixed height from .subgroup and decreased margin to make div more elastic

or if you want to keep margin on parent but you don t want height to be more then window height you could use calc 100vh - marginofchildren like this demo

also you cannot rely on fixed 300px margin i.e if window height is less than 500px you re already missing 100px


lower available suitable
this may be ommited once height is lower than available - thus negative margin may work

if the list items were of a fixed height i could add margin to put it lower down but because each item of the list can vary in height this won t be suitable


width smaller values
gives a way to make the margin transparent but they are still there and the plot is smaller than height and width i set in the saved file

what i want it to do is to center a given image from a database into a div for example if the given images width is bigger than height it echos it with a left margin

basically if it can scale to 100 height of the parent container margin padding included without the width becoming bigger than the parent container s let it scale up

when i add a margin to the divs the width becomes smaller and the height stays the same so the aspect ratio changes

how to calculate element s width and height with their padding margin values using less code

for width i can use margin 0 auto but height is trickier because it would need to make a div absolute

they appear to scale on the width ok but grow in height leaving more margin between the text and the border


larger close windows
sometimes when enough content items is added this div height is larger than windows and part of div content is not visible at all it stays bellow page margin

setting the datatemplate s grid s width and height to be larger than the cell with a negative margin can produce a close result but if you resize the column the problem shows itself again


page earlier barcodes
you cant see 45 barcodes because their margin is bigger than page height

so increasing height padding margin or hiding showing earlier elements on the page will affect and push down elements defined later


images someone easier
should i just target each images and count the container height and use the remainer as top margin or is there easier solution

edit someone else suggested css and i believe that using the height and width directives from css will give you the same result as using the same attributes of the tag but doesn t limit you strictly to images and a will play nicer with any margin or padding directives you might use


greater top bottom
in conjunction with a negative margin equal to or greater than the height of the top and bottom borders if any to further remove the element

#footer s height is more than 800px so the #container should lose its top margin value by touching #footer and continue scrolling the page without that floating div

the first row has a height that is much larger than the margin bottom of its .content div so that the margin-bottom is contained and should not effect anything outside of its container

the width and height you provided should be greater than amount of padding for example summing top and bottom margin 18 + 18 36px so height should be greater than 36px same goes for height

margin should be less than or equal to coin image height and also give some left margin to fill effects

your wrapper has a height of 100 of the body which also has a height of 100 but it also has a top margin making the total outer height greater than the height of the window

your listview item s height is looking bigger because your are applying 17dp padding and 4dp margin at the top and 7dp padding and 4dp margin at the bottom of the textview ...so its taking total 32dp extra space excluding your textview

i have this code for when an image loads in our app and then when the height is greater than the width add a class to bump up the margin

in activity_main.xml below the feedbackview has a margin top of -36dp which is greater than its height when non-negated

i assume margintop can t be solved since im setting margin top to -820 in order to get at a point of top 275 therefore screens smaller than 1200px height the div will go much higher...

since my top content for the homepage is a fixed height through javascript i tried simply changing the top margin to the difference between the window height and that fixed value when window height is greater than the fixed value

you basically need to make sure that either the content has a bottom margin greater than or equal to the height of the footer or if the content is in a container of some sort that it s container has a bottom padding equal to or greater than the height of the footer

you will need to set android layout_paddingtop on the relativelayout equal or greater than the height of the repeat password field + any top margin it might have

if the height is greater than 66px i want to apply a negative top margin equal to half of its height

the value of margin top will be equal or greater than height of the fixed header height

if you want to use it then add a bottom margin to the content_main which should be equal or greater than the height of the ad layout

it is treating the floated ul as position absolute but only when its height is less than or equal to the negative top margin on its containing parent

if i apply a negative margin to it that is greater than its height the first time feedbackview.showtext is called it doesn t animate in correctly

if the element height is greater than the window height minus the nav bar height then additional margin is added to the bottom of my element so that what was hidden behind the bottom nav bar is now revealed on scroll

but then the java script adds some margin to top and bottom when the image height is smaller

you also need to set a height that is greater than the negative top margin so part of the element will be visible so the user can hover over it

you ll need to set the top margin for whatever item you want under it to be greater than the height of your navbar in order for it to show up correctly


free	memmove---------------------------------------------------

others
the compiler is free to choose a method that is more efficient than memmove


jvisualvm	jstat---------------------------------------------------

others
the tooling provided with the jdk jstat jconsole jvisualvm is much more reliable


youtube	vimeo---------------------------------------------------

others
the youtube approach seems much more efficient as far as amount of code and simplicity of understanding which makes me wonder why vimeo would use promises in this simple fast case

while vimeo is more of a professional site youtube offers html5 h.264 video playback support for all videos so they ll play on iphone

in terms of interacting with javascript youtube is miles ahead of vimeo and performs much more reliably

vimeo will always have fewer users than youtube because the user experience is poor for low bitrate users


perl	tcl---------------------------------------------------

others
hence the code style you adopted actually tries to make tcl code look more like python or perl or whatever was your previous language for no real value and also look alien to seasoned tcl developers

supports javascript mason xbl xul rhtml scss python html ruby python3 xml sass xslt django html5 perl css twig less smarty node.js tcl templatetoolkit php

i know that perl performs better for some regex but will the tcl performance really be this bad in comparison

in fact in my experience php is faster than any dynamic language i have benchmarked it against - python perl ruby tcl are all slower performing than php

it is written in tcl which is a language somewhat simpler than perl but broadly in the same family and not difficult to learn

tcl is more verbose than perl here

while tcl syntax looks more related to shell syntax like bash or tcsh tcl is actually more closely related to perl or php or ruby

tcl arrays are closer to what python calls a dict and a hash in perl

tcl is no better nor worse than perl ruby python or any other scripting language in this regard -- they all do basic file operations with equal aplomb

tcl might be easier to embed than perl but i do have to agree matthew scharley s reasoning


avr	microcontroller---------------------------------------------------

others
i see that the microcontroller used in commercial devices are much cheaper than the avr or pic


openssl	crypto++---------------------------------------------------

others
tried all day with crypto++ to no avail openssl was much easier just hung up on this one error.


for-loop	while-loop---------------------------------------------------

others
also it seems like a for-loop is of greater cost to the compiler than a while-loop

if you re just going to loops through point use a for-loop as while-loop is more prone to dropping into an endless loops if you forgot to increment counter or doing wrongly or do it in multiple places

the reason for the second case much slower on sorted data is that a while-loop is cheaper than the equivalent for-loop when there are zero iterations

ok i think i may have fixed my problem i changed the logic and so i m now using a for-loop i could have still used a while-loop but i think a for-loop is better

you can think of the for-loop being a more compact way of writing the while-loop

i searched a lot and discovered nice approaches of others that do solve my problem but out of curiosity i would love to know if there is solution to my problem that keeps the while-loop despite a for-loop would be more appropriate in the first place as i know the range but the day will come when i will need a while loops


cleaner faster
i have also found that a while-loop is faster than a for-loop

and now we know that for-loop is faster than while-loop

edit just realized a while-loop may well be a lot cleaner than a for-loop for this


scrypt	pbkdf2---------------------------------------------------

slower better bcrypt
also since this is a bit old bcrypt is indeed better than pbkdf2 but scrypt is even better

pbkdf2 bcrypt and scrypt are much slower

pbkdf2 is arguably a better option than bcrypt scrypt having been much more thoroughly studied and tested


others
i like pbkdf2 because it s so ubiquitous and recommended by nist even though there are very reasonable arguments that bcrypt and scrypt are stronger

bcrypt is weaker than scrypt although still three orders of magnitude stronger than pbkdf2 because it only requires 4 kb of memory

alternatively scrypt bcrypt or pbkdf2 provide more secure algorithms


tcpreplay	scapy---------------------------------------------------

others
if you need better performances than what scapy can offer you should probably use tcpreplay


wordpress	expressionengine---------------------------------------------------

others
but in my opinion for most sites expressionengine is a better choice than wordpress


comm	grep---------------------------------------------------

others
i find grep to be more admin-friendly than comm so if you just want the set of matching lines useful for comparing csvs for instance simply use

i rather prefer grep since it s much faster than comm and also does not require the input to be sorted

if this is an issue you could try sd stream diff which doesn t require sorting like comm does nor process substitution like the above examples is orders or magnitude faster than grep -f and supports infinite streams


setinterval	settimeout---------------------------------------------------

look tasks appropriate
i ve replaced settimeout with setinterval which is more appropriate for repeated tasks

also i advise you to take a look at javascript s setinterval since it is more appropriate than settimeout for what you want to do


little performance statement
i find setinterval is a little cleaner than chaining settimeout calls

and im not shure about this statement javascript likes settimeout more than setinterval which gives a little performance boost


others
also in my experience at least settimeout offers a much more aesthetic experience than setinterval or requestanimationframe

this in effect would traverse the comment tree linearly and would allow the setinterval or probably settimeout would be more appropriate to have a noticeable affect

it seems that settimeout has bigger priority than setinterval which could be delayed

my solution was to increase the settimeout to create a bigger delay before the next part of the script commenced but also to add an additional clearinterval as the top line of the script running within the setinterval

you made the right choice using setinterval instead of settimeout here as in this case settimeout would have been less efficient with memory resources

it works super well initially but over the course of about a minute the sounds become noticeably out of sync as i ve read happens with setinterval i ve read that settimeout can be more consistently accurate

what i observed on inactive tabs in chrome all your settimeout must be the same for setinterval waiting less than 1000ms are rounded to 1000ms

settimeout is used in lieu of setinterval which is more cumbersome when it comes to killing the cycle

logic points that settimeout would be more proper solution for spawning and such but setinterval gives me possibility of providing progress bar while settimeout does not

i read that settimeout is less cpu resources intensive than setinterval

a variation that uses settimeout rather than setinterval and uses the more cross-browser secure document.location.reload true

setinterval vs settimeout i used settimeout instead of setinterval which gives more control over timing

keep in mind that using setinterval is less efficient for this case then using settimeout which doesn t require comparing times at all as it schedules the alarm to occur at a particular time as setinterval will use more processor cycles to both schedule a check and then to compare the times

using setinterval may be more readable to some eyes but i think the settimeout approach you have is fine


better function use
instead initiate all the settimeout s you need for the entire animation at the same time with increasing delays in a loop and let them run their course or better yet use setinterval which is the better way of doing animations and how for instance jquery s animations work

using settimeout for such purposes is better idea than setinterval as you don t have to clear them and they won t get crowded - if your fight takes longer than period then this won t run into next fight

i also faced the same problem and i fixed it by writing a new controller and a view for the div to be refreshed and then used setinterval actually settimeout worked better for my requirement

but settimeout would be better than setinterval because with setinterval if your previous ajax request is not complete and you start another request there will have multiple requests which would sooner be problematic

the function settimeout is intended for a single timeout so using setinterval would be a more appropriate option

setinterval is better than settimeout for this task

so for scheduling purposes i suggest you to use the setinterval approach while the settimeout approach is better for delayed execution and asynchronous work

i thought about using the setinterval function instead but because i am dealing with multiple functions i thought settimeout would be better

settimeout evaluates your function once setinterval is more suited to call your chrono at specified interval

you can use setinterval instead but for most animations settimeout is easier to control and more importantly.

this is also one of the few places i think you d be better off with setinterval rather than settimeout

using settimeout is considered better than setinterval because of the screwy ways that js s event loop works

in general repeated calls to settimeout are better than a single call to setinterval for a few reasons

the above delta timer is better than setinterval method 1 makes use of settimeout method 2 but also corrects itself starts the timer using a function method 3 and doesn t pollute the scope with a special clockstart function method 4

also i think you d be better off with setinterval in this situation instead of using an infinite settimeout loop

to make it infinite loop you have to wrap all these code inside a function and use only one setinterval because using more than one can damage your program and use a settimeout to delay the second pragragh bb class changes this is the function that i came up with

also setinterval is often better replaced by settimeout

setinterval would be the better way than settimeout

if so then you can just pop lines off the array using settimeout which is better than setinterval for most animations

settimeout is better than setinterval here because setinterval will start at every 5 secs but settimeout will start once each time your job is done and wait for 5 seconds which will make your script adaptive to server response timings

also settimeout is a better approach than setinterval as you explicitly reset it on each round trip

it uses settimeout however settimeout is a better solution than setinterval because it will only queue a new one if the previous one is complete

setinterval is much more suited for countdown timers and things you need to run continually since settimeout only runs once and you need to keep on calling it

the use of one settimeout timer is more preferably than several setinterval timers

instead of a setinterval here settimeout will work far better

instead of using a for-loop and settimeout would setinterval work better for what you need

we could still do this with settimeout but setinterval is better suited for this job

i think using settimeout is safer than setinterval

i understand from searching on so that setinterval is a better way to approach this that settimeout which i was using initially but i haven t figured out how to specify that the function needs to repeat


need useful simpler
setinterval is more useful than settimeout here as it recurs automatically and you don t need to keep setting it

now a routine to initiate once per second - settimeout is usually more useful than setinterval

as for me settimeout is simpler than setinterval in this case as you won t need to clearinterval in the end of the array

settimeout is more relevant than setinterval since the first method just waits for a delay and executes a logic whereas the second function is meant for repeating a logic on periodic intervals


tftp	tcp---------------------------------------------------

others
you are right that using tcp is probably better to use for something like this or even an existing protocol like tftp


onenote	ms-office---------------------------------------------------

others
if you would like to see onenote add-ins supported on more platforms i strongly suggest adding this to the ms-office uservoice


qdockwidget	qwidget---------------------------------------------------

others
the center widget is a qdockwidget containing a qwidget with a qvboxlayout containing more stuff


ganglia	metrics---------------------------------------------------

others
however i wonder if this is the best way of doing this if you want to observe specific behaviour you might be better off isolating a specific input file and debugging against a local pseudo-cluster and if you want system metrics you could do worse than give ganglia a lookm as it is pretty mauch already built into hadoop


onclick	onmouseup---------------------------------------------------

others
note also that onclick would be much more appropriate than onmouseup for this


wan	lan---------------------------------------------------

others
lan is more or less stable wan can be with network issues like

wan is less stable than lan

even if all the traffic resides on the same network the client traffic will have been throttled by your wan capacity which is always less than your lan capacity

i find that on a lan things are faster without compression compression takes more time than xfer and on a wan it s the reverse


gif	bmp---------------------------------------------------

image map vector
gif jpeg png bmp are more standard than any vector format where usually adobe has the market

jpg jpeg bmp png webp gif svg js map ico css less scss

i haven t worked with any more than jpg png and gif so there might be some more image types out there that can fit into this function bmp


others
you could also use bmp in place of gif and get a larger file size

there are a couple of options where you can set one color as transparent then load a simple bmp jpeg and do some bitmap tricks however using ico gif will be far easier for this


textmate	sublimetext---------------------------------------------------

others
textmate isn t known to perform well on large files but sublimetext supposedly performs better than vim on large files and yet supports legacy textmate syntax parsers

but i ve found that sublimetext 2 has some features i like more than textmate and also tm v2 which is in beta

macvim sublimetext is much thicker whereas textmate is slicker and sophisticated


metaclass	superclass---------------------------------------------------

others
from what i ve learned so far metaclass and inheritance from superclass in python serve a very similar purpose but superclass inheritance is more powerful


mef	prism---------------------------------------------------

others
using mef for the add-in architecture over prism can be cleaner because the reasons for each project are vastly different and mef has a cleaner model i think it can also act as a basic ioc container

i personally think combining prism with mef makes this type of situation easier though since mef allows for easier dynamic extensibility for roles

this means with mef you have modularity from top to bottom wheras with prism modules are more granular units

mef seemed a bit easier than prism and i started to do a hello world mef app with this tutorial


bluecloth	rdiscount---------------------------------------------------

others

better reliable faster
rdiscount seems to be much faster and more reliable than bluecloth

consider rdiscount which substitutes for bluecloth but is faster and better maintained


lisp	racket---------------------------------------------------

others
racket is closer to scheme than to common lisp but you could dip your toes into the lisp family without the speed bump of the emacs style of development


common implementations side
do racket macros have more advanced functionality than those found in scheme or common lisp

on the side of using macros racket has always been more advanced than other scheme and lisp implementations


phpmyadmin	mysql-workbench---------------------------------------------------

others
i think you should install phpmyadmin on your server this will allow you to access your database from work school cafe etc mysql-workbench is more advanced and gives you more features so you can deal with changing the structure and editing any rows columns relations and much more look at phpmyadmin s features it has most if not all


icmp	tcp---------------------------------------------------

others
ping is just low level icmp protocol defined in internet layer whereas tcp is more complex protocol defined in transport layer


qtabwidget	qtoolbutton---------------------------------------------------

others
note that instead of using one of the tabs as your + button i have used qtoolbutton thereby making it simpler to make tabs closable with qtabwidget settabsclosable bool


nerdtree	rails.vim---------------------------------------------------

others
if you want a recommendation i would say vim with three plugins - rails.vim make vim more aware of rails and its structure command-t great for jumping around between files quickly and nerdtree - a graphical tree based file browser


rar	zip---------------------------------------------------

others
i ve heard that rar decompression requires much more memory than zip decompression

by the way i would suggest creating rar self-extracting archives instead of zip self-extracting archives as with rar compression the exe file with the right switches for best compression using additionally also solid archive options could be much smaller than with zip compression

one reason to use rar it is sooooo much better than zip


elementtree	beautifulsoup---------------------------------------------------

others
beautifulsoup is more forgiving in terms of well-formed xml structure see i had to edit the xml a bit to make things work for elementtree and it s actually much easier to work with


dwoo	smarty---------------------------------------------------

others
so far it has proven to be faster than smarty and it provides a compatibility layer to allow developers that have been using smarty for years to switch their application over to dwoo progressively


folder	dir---------------------------------------------------

others
folder objects undoubtedly give the fullest access to file information but the older dir function is easier to use and allows specification of a filename template so i have used that

any ideas how to use the command dir to more than 1 folder in one command

things like cmd c dir don t know why - and yes i do cmd c dir in cases i am in some kind of shared network folder with thousands of files and ls is significantly slower than dir

i am running into an issue where for some of the folder there are too many subfolders and it spits out the directory name k really long path blah is too long not the actual dir- the actual dir is longer than 260 chars

using a filesystemobject is more powerful than dir because dir only returns a string while filesystemobject lets you work with files and folder as actual objects which are much more powerful

it iterates through the most recent folder returned by the dir command each returned on one line and after it encounters the 4th it stops if there are more than 4 folder

calculates the size of the first 5 folder in your home dir should work on all platforms fails with an arrayindexoutofboundexception if there are less than five folder in your home dir

i solved this myself the problem was just qt errors no problem with the code at all for some reason it didnt like that my project files were in a folder structure of more than one folder before my project files used the exact same code in a new dir and it worked


directory bin guarantees
there are no guarantees that dir which is the name of a folder within your source dir will be longer in number of chars than the number returned by the randrange

i did first try deleting the .svn folder from the bin directory but all that did was cause it to complain that the bin dir was no longer under source control and halt


fold	combinators---------------------------------------------------

others
i m also looking for more examples and explanations of complex combinators more complex than fold in common programming languages


code128	code39---------------------------------------------------

others
data density in code128 is better than code39 - since it gets mentioned that often in other replies


glut	glfw---------------------------------------------------

others
between these glfw is much closer to glut in character -- a small toolkit for abstracting away most of the os-dependent parts so you can produce opengl programs with relatively little hassle


opengl menus posters
or if you re really focused on only doing opengl i may suggest using glfw which is the better glut but you ll have to draw the menus yourself using opengl

edit explained as i m guessing you are somehow forced to use glut but i agree with other posters glfw is a better option if you can choose


post	get---------------------------------------------------

user easier safe
now i want from all user that have more than 1 post to get all post except the most recent post

but if you want to get the username of the user who makes the post is easier than that you only need to access the request.user

given the above how would i get a list of all the tags on a given post assuming that more than one user added tags

however post is a bit more safe than get because get could be stored in the history

get would obviously allow for a user to change the value a lot easier than post

note that i am assuming a user can get invited to more than one post which seems logical

i want to get all the users that has more than one post but

btw if you also post the question in apache user email list it might get answered more quickly

i would like to know how to only get the post that the user either hasn t read at all no record in views or the post latest_reply.id is bigger than the one saved in views

post has a higher overhead marginally if we re honest but it all adds up but it doesn t become part of the url so can t be seen by say a casual observer over the user s shoulder - whereas get can

you can t get more than 20 post if you are a sandbox user

while users can manipulate post it s far easier to manipulate get

some people say get can be less safe than post -- but to the seasoned user this doesn t make any significant difference because they can intercept and modify headers of the request

using get is much easier than using post for most of developers


able ones author
i m able to query my database below to get the result that i want but i don t want to have to iterate through all of the author objects just the ones that have more than one post

i actually like that having got the gold flag weight badge i m able to flag the problem post that are less obvious - the ones that 9 times out of 10 get marked as helpful but occasionally get disputed


appropriate base things
get is more appropriate than post for queries because of its safe semantics

however using get rather than post is typically more appropriate for things like this where you are only selecting different options rather than changing data on your server

on that base a get is more appropriate then a post


things type sorry
get is more often used on unsecure type of datatransactions like for example a searchform and post is used when you want to make more secure things like a login form

sorry that this post is more of the and for further information... type than a direct answer which i think has now been given-- i just thought it was helpful not to get things lost inside comments


suitable inserts
where 404 may be suitable for get and put update but less suitable for post inserts

while using get isn t that pretty in this case post could be more suitable you could do this


others
as per the blog post to give eclipse more heap space symptom is â you get unable to execute dex java heap spaceâ edit eclipse.ini with something like

2 as mentioned by mike brent get is wide open to easy and simple abuses but while his recommendation of post is better it s still open to abuse unless appropriate measures are taken see 3 below

there appears to be a common mis-conception that post is more secure than get simply because it seems more obvious how to get a browser to manipulate the post variable

post some samples of how your events are wired up and i get give a more specific example

this ties to another post i had earlier basically when the user clicks a link a script is loaded into the big div the big div which contains the smaller div later on i need to reload the smaller div but it requires variable available only in the big div and i cannot include them in the small one for other reasons basically the script works when you load everything at once but when you try to dynamically load the small div i get a invalid argument supplied error here is how my code structure

anyone knows how to bypass this problem and get more than 100 post

i noticed once the length of a get parameter is longer than 400 bytes or 2000 bytes for a post parameter g-wan returns 400 error

additional options are to show this via a timeout so it s only shown when the post takes more than a short time and to use some form of fadein not sure if possible with a dialog then you don t get the annoying flash on the times it s very quick

what i want is to get all post which contains 20 less in the title

post gives you more options and dosn t have a limit on parameter query string length like get the only negative is post is slower by a couple of milliseconds to create the request

also after you are done with your bulk import reduce maxtime and maxdocs so that any incremental post you will do to solr will get committed much sooner

when i try to get more than 100 post it returns

for now if post have more than one attachment i get n entries back.

a post request would not provide any more safety than a get request any half-decent web debugging tool can forge post requests

given http supports various methods like get put post delete and more like patch head options etc

sometimes get is a better option in those read-only scenarios because it makes your url scheme richer and avoids these sort of post warnings

the usual wait time of the post is not too long not too larger than get so i don t think that should be an issue and post always gets back with a 200

i m working on a project where i have a set of post a post has many comments and i want to get all the post that have had more comments than the post comment threshold in the post comment date range

caching with an activerecord object creates a key that includes updated_at by default so if a post changes the first visitor that loads the post will have a longer wait time and every subsequent visitor will get the benefits of caching

get is basically for just getting retrieving data a get should not have a body so aside from cookies the only place to pass info is in the url and urls are limited in length get is less secure compared to post because data sent is part of the url

usual way with tagging is to get objects by tag but if tags are used by few applications it may give more than post

hope you get the more clarification by this post

if you re transfering more than about 512 bytes then using post rather than get should prove more reliable

post has a lot more advantages than get

it seems that a lot of people have been confused by this post and started asking more and more to get the mentioned above fix

the problem is that some post types have way more post than others so i want to show only 3 post per post type to get a little variation in the loop

but if today post is less than 10 post i will get back the yesterday post to query

note that doing this will get the values via post var instead get wich makes more sense since you are sending via post your form

you could use a post instead of a get to allow larger files and be semantically correct

the client post scores and fetches highscore lists from the server and everything seemed to be working perfectly we had been testing it for a month with no problems and the code is really simple with not much more than a put get

you can t get a patent any more because with this post i will claim prior art -

in this way is if the parameter arrives by post or via get the withdraw more

get is more appropiate for idempotent queries while post is more appropiate for action queries but you can shoot yourself in the foot just as easily with any of them if you don t understand the security architecture for the application you re maintaining

so i have a post system and i want the box to get larger as more post come in

i m trying to get deeper with post and pre incrementors but am a bit stuck with the following expression

basically ie sometimes caches ajax get requests so setting the ajaxoption s httpmethod to post is a less fragile way to construct an actionlink

i ended finding that post was more work than it s worth and that you could accomplish the same with get

the problem is that the post shipping takes longer than the call get alert then shows me the session variable not updated

type book why do we need anything more than http get put post

i resorted to split the two in swagger list-without-search as get and list+search as post just to put the page in the swagger documentation also if the latter actually works also as get

i m sure there s a work around to use get for emails but the alternative post is much more easier and doesn t require any hacks to get around

i have tried doing the same request as when the page loads when this callback occurs and get the post that are newer than those already on the page

the part life before binding in this post was easier for me to get the understanding of how two-way binding can be created

any pointers would be appreciated i d love to get this working as you can imagine doing the post synchronously is considerably slower than asynchronously

obviously i could script each input into a get request address and replace the img src with that but post is more desirable and it seems there should be a more elegant way to make use of the form s submit mechanism

but do also remember that in your case get request looks more appropriate and as balusc says its not good practice to use post for bookmarkable page-to-page navigation

because your not going to get that using a shader like this by itself because as it stands it will only apply to objects like your plane but not the full camera view that requires a post image effect

if you find this fix helpful then please do up-vote the question such that it doesn t go in negative so that the post doesn t get closed and more people may get help

so it is considerably less then what facebook states in their documentation at least looking by the date however by count it seems you get more than 50 post

get is more vulnerable than post as it can be transmitted and stored

eventually i went back to post because we needed the fix quick but it has been bugging me because semantically a get is more correct in this case

also try post ing using ajax as get is much more likely being cached

the problem i have noticed is that sometimes the jquery post result is retrieved earlier than the load of the .js file has been completed so i get an error and of course the jquery plugin doesn t work

if you post for help on questions that can be resolved yourself without any real effort you re doomed when you get exposed to more complicated things

i know my post became slightly bigger but i tried to state clearly my objective and my approach to get the job done...and to get expert opinion.

but for my personally preference any default state should be done before hand and not the in the script for example initiate your radio dom element to have checked property and then onload script call the post directly anyway post is not designed for this purpose just imagine post as to save something if you just want to get query some data get would be more reasonable

if i need to display one 1 friends post i can do this simply but when there are couple of friends with more than 1 post i can t get the name and picurl of the user and it displays null in json response

i have just done some image processing using the python image library pil using a post i found earlier to perform fourier transforms of images and i can t get the save function to work

give it a try works perfect for me what it is doing query get the all the post with a left jon with comments table so when a post has comment them n it also has the comment_date if no comments posted on the post then in result set it will be null so i have merged the comment_date with post_date so which post has the greater date for comment_date or post_date it will first and so on

the only scenario in which post is slightly less susceptible is that many websites that arenâ t under the attackerâ s control say a third-party forum allow embedding arbitrary images allowing the attacker to inject an arbitrary get request but prevent all ways of injecting an arbitary post request whether automatic or manual

in some instances accepting a get rather than a post could make you more subject to a csrf attack

is there anything more i should do more than changing post to get

if you are curious though rather than just trusting a book or a blog post it is better to make a simple example and take it apart - you get it straight from the horse s mouth and you learn a whole lot more

for eps is the same situation the post script is more readable but you should apply all necessery transformations on object before get its size

i have links of term on sidebar when i attach more than one post to term it get repeat

to answer part of your second question with .net if the post is larger than maxrequestlength part of the .net configuration but smaller than maxallowedcontentlength part of the iis configuration you can create a custom http module to get at the portion of the post that came through

added just so this post doesn t get down-voted any more -

the blog post i mentioned earlier says it s more about interaction did the product name get added rather than state

but a get seems more logical than a post anyway

i know django forms uses post but in this instance i feel that get is more appropriate which means i don t have to use django forms but does that mean i also don t have to validate the data

while you don t get the whole post you do still have to query the database for the id of post with mood grumpy so unless you have lots of post it s probably easier to just go with the answer dorel gave

now next time user open app it will show post and will get any new post or fetch more older post but there is no way it can detect a change in one of the post that it already have in client side

legacy way would be to use post redirect get harder way on struts2 would be using the token interceptor but if you aren t target old browser just do like that

generally i ve read many time you should do ajax calls as get requests not post because post produces more overhead and traffic

i have followed modified code that dan gentry wrote years back in his blog post titled more relatedfieldwidgetwrapper â my very own popup to get the + sign next to foreign keys and figured out a way to load them to the next page my problem is i do not know how to back out of a chain of these

it seems some operators do better with post s than get s - this is a feeling i get from what some nigerian users mention

please note this is the best answer you can get without providing more input look at the comments to your post what are your printf results

for example on the blog page of my current project i have two widgets in the sidebar one for latest tweets and one for latest music news however as you can see on this page the content of the blog post all test posts... are much longer than the height of the two widgets and would of course get larger as more post are added

that means - get all the post that have higher id than the current one

if you have more than one post with the same com_id in eve.com_id you will get multiple post in your result

the scenario that came up in the original post was due more to the nature of the test and the author s not realizing how floating point numbers get rounded displayed than due to a set of conditions that might come up in the real world to cause problems with code when using np.where

however there s one thing we haven t considered yet - what if you never get more than 5 post

maybe i would mostly always choose post over get it s more tidy and refreshing and going back issues with post method are a thing from the past in any major browser they just ask you if you want to resend the data don t they

all good points however in answer to the question get requests are more useful in certain scenarios over post requests

we provide a number of support resources which may get faster response than post on third party sites including the virtuoso users mailing list public support forums and confidential support cases

i get far more than 50 post

i have a blog post explaining more about the subject as well as i have created a django blank project in github so you can get that to have a start point of your project using vagrant

posting your form with get instead of post would be more preferable in case of search form as u wont need to maintain any session and no need of storing values in database also

i need a query to get results from stackexchange dataset in such a way that it returns me 100 top reputation users with not more than 3 post body of post for each user

is type get faster than type post cause i am curious how both work

get may yeild marginally better performance some webservers write post contents to a temporary file before invoking the handler

the pinoyyd post is neater and get straight to the point how do i authorise a background web app without user intervention

this is my first post on stack overflow i want to get involved into more php that is the reason i got started today i will need more expert help in the future

first i would suggest making your search form to use get not post of course this will depend on use cases and requirements but search forms should use get to make them more usable accessible

to get the feed of facebook api but it only returns max 12 subattachments while the post include more 12 attached image

i run the ab test several times with same results post is faster but get is lighter

i ve looked through other people s questions on this site but it still isn t getting through to me so i thought i d post my code and get an answered more tailored to what i m doing

i agree to get any blame here for such incorrect using of the sending post and waiting for more then 2 hours for response

i basically know zilch of java but i m hoping someone can help me put something into that .parse function that would get me post that have dateupdated newer than 5 days

but using post instead of get presumably adds one more level of protection for xsrf types of attack it does not you need some form of explicit xsrf protection token with post or with get

you could use post here as well but get will be clearer as a beginner and refreshing won t invoke the browser s submit form again dialogue

i know this has been covered indepth in other post but i can t get my var_dump of post to print out more than the last checkbox that is checked

when timber calls order_children duplicate entries post belonging to more than one of the menu categories get overwritten

have a look at this post to read more about getting a string from a memorystrea how do you get a string from a memorystream

that is the resource returned on a get had less fields than the one passed on a post

try to sketch out your ideas post somewhere find more people interested assemble a group and get your hands dirty

to get rid of the annoying warning it might help to tell paypal to return to your website using get instead of post and send less of the important data back

ajax calls using get are more performant than post according to yahoo

gets have a size restrictions post do not or at least it s a configurable setting on the server and has a larger higher end than a get request would

get and head being much more frequent than post

if a post has a more recent reply i want to get the replies created_on value but also get the post post_id and subject

i m trying to get cloudinary direct uploads working on a rails app using carrierwave and accepts_nested_attributes_for to submit one or more images with a post

adding on top of zheyuan s interesting post did some more experiments to see that we can get the same results with intercept as well as follows

post has one more letter in it than get so it s less compact

one way that you can consider for hide information not totally but more stronger than get of user is create a json with your infos and send a post request to your page

this post is more to get advises and ideas rather than solving a problem

this is what i ended up settling on using i will upvote and welcome all new post in this thread that get this done with less code

please note however that you may still get some repetition if a post is assigned to more than one category

none of the post have more than 10 comments so it wouldn t get out of hand

i m currenlty putting each post in a but this just stacks all of the divs and i get a large space between post which are bigger

the reason to use post for sending sensitive data is that it prevents data leakage via the query string although another way would be to use get with custom headers set although post makes much more sense

i have simplified the app so the post is shorter but the basic problem is that if i get test in workouthandler - it cannot recognize methods in wardenstrategies or loginhelper unless i also include those files in the handler they are already included in app.rb

you can also chose to get more than 25 post at once

and if i want to get access to logged-in users post to be more specific post that user share from my fanpage is there any other workaround because i have tried using user_status and unable to get it work

i would be really grateful if somebody could post the correct syntax firstly so i can get it working and more importantly so i can work through a working example to understand what the function is actually doing

and if you find yourself with more issues after this post i check my github daily so logging an issue against my repository will get more help in a better place for a back and forth

other than the fact that get has one character less than post i doubt there is any performance difference

i think i generally agree with your summary - it makes sense that postandasyncreply is slower than post so if the caller doesn t need to get a notification from the agent when the operation such as putting value into the queue completes it should definitely expose a way to do that using just post

i have been trying get data out of new reddit post but theres limitation where you cant get data from more than 100 post

give the resources a read have a go at implementing the functionality you need and if you get stuck post smaller recreatable problems with the code you have written

i think using post is more elegant and has more options for further development than passing them via get


error help exception
also if you could post the exception you get could be from more help to find what s happening with your code

or in case there are less than 5 post you will get an error

when i want to get more than 54 post i receive this error


pattern structure user-friendly
note also that in general it is best to follow the pattern of reloading pages with get after post which makes you less susceptible to form resubmitions in which case using sessions for storage is the better solution

i am getting used to the post redirect get pattern i find it a very good procedure and it also seems to get me thinking more about page structure and not relying on asp.net events too often

at any rate i think web applications that follow the post redirect get pattern are slightly more user-friendly but your mileage may vary


limit 2mb several
in the event that a get must be longer than that limit several people have suggested that it s ok to use a post instead

so is it enough only to use limit to get more than 50 post

there is a default limit of post method which is 2mb which is way higher than get

you ll hit problems with larger submissions and file-uploads as the size limit for a get is much smaller than a post


body idempotent character
get is more performant as it is idempotent and does not contain a message body where as post does

the get is usually faster because it has no encapsulation sends data via url usually with a 255 character limit as post exists encapsulation by being sent by the body of the http request


api tumblr instagram
how to get more than 20 post from instagram using their api

however it isn t clear how much the value can be for the standard tumblr api you can t get more than 50 post at a time


easier button checks
get would obviously allow for a user to change the value a lot easier than post so suitable checks for existance and ownership of the record would be important

have a look at this post it is probably easier to get the selected radio button by changing your itemscontrol to use a listbox with the existing datatemplate


requests maximum fake
is post more compact than get since get requests have to be url-encoded

get requests have more restrictive size limitations than post requests

post requests are harder to fake compared to get requests so you have that going for you which is nice

more over it seems that get requests are more lightweight than post under high load

in your case since get requests take far less time to go around than post requests that s why they re completing first

get requests have smaller limits than post in the specs

post requests are much more complex that get ones so the parser lies in a separate package body-parser

post requests can be much larger than get requests as get requests are limited by the maximum length of a url

so you can implement get or head requests just fine but post requests are trickier


second link simple
there are simple examples 1 2 for intercepting get requests in the documentation for http-on-modify-request however intercepting post requests is more complicated

in my opinion the second way to achieve this is better because using get is not thats ecure in my opinion.it s easier than using post

each page would have 2 actions a get that takes simple ids and a post which takes more complex models

from a hacker s point of view a get forgery is much easier than post forgery at the first you only post a link at the second you need to point to a malware website with hidden iframe and autosubmit forms but both of them fail if tokens are checked

i think the problem is when the page is loading to get second record from database when the pagination link is selected post values are no more passing to model page so might be the problem


category categories ones
i get somehow category repeated if it has more than 1 post eg

i try it and i get all the categories and not just the ones with more than 1 post in them


amount data candidate
get has limitation of amount when submitting data safe to use up to 2000 characters ie s limit and is visible to address bar of the browser and not being used for login password and post can send more data than get and also not visible to address bar

get is basically just like post it just has a limit on the amount of data you can send which is usually a lot smaller than post and a semantic difference which makes get not a good candidate from that point of view even if technically they both can do it


sense static specific
i know using post would make more sense but i am using get for specific reasons

that would mean i d need to do a post rather than a get though get makes more sense when i m just getting some static data right


number amount smaller
one final note post can transmit a larger amount of information than get

because in my server logs it s showing a lot of post with million of ping while the other pages have been get is a smaller amount of number

i know there can be problems with posts_per_page but nothing is working i ve searched a lot to get the query to display more than one post

i don t understand why if i count the number of items in the 2nd response the number of post is smaller than the number of post i get from 1st query

basically it equates the number of topics to the number of post so i always get x topics and x post if post is greater than 0


info mapping users
post your mapping info and one of response s hit you do not want to get may help more

what i m trying to get is a page that displays 20 users per page will have pagination with the fallowing info it should show only users that have more than 2 post published


last mode share
if the last 100 post have more than one share from the page he get ranked up or some superpoints

first of all if your instagram client is in sandbox mode then you can t get more than 20 post more clearly last 20 post


field table columns
the problem i am having is that there isn t a timestamp field that i can use to page with and some post have way more than 5000 likes 5000 being the most records you can get at one time

and each post have a like_count integer field i want to get users along their post that has more that n post which is liked more that m times i do

there is a field in the post table named scheduled_date which i will get the post that are less than or equal to the current date

you can of course have only one table aka post and keep adding more columns that are unique for each post_type where they get filled in if relevant

i am setting the policy to constrained-resize to get rid of the extra column based on this so post tableview has more columns than specified

i need some advice on how to get the mysql to respond to a select query from post table within 3 to 4 secs post have more than 1 million records


details replication helper
another post outlines some more details on this how to get master-master replication with subversion

this post goes into more details how to get charles proxy work with android 7 nougat

maybe you can edit your post and provide more details on your helper methods current_user the error message you get with the code above


idea good lower
it is just an example that shows a scenario in which get is more secure than post but i don t think it would be a good idea to choose get over post from this attack reason

generally when passing lots of data to the server to be processed or stored using post is a good idea since get has a lower limit than that of post


url request parameters
post requests can provide a bit more context besides the url but for your question one could argue that they are just a more complicated variation of a get request providing some more arguments besides the ones from the url and in most cases one could turn a post request into a get request with a more elaborated url anyways

make the form get not post because the request is not changing anything on the server so get verb is more appropriate and also the get verb will pass all the form values as a query string parameters so you ll get the desired effect

you can also add some get parameters to a post request which are received on the server side as long as the get url is not longer that 1024 bytes

by doing a redirect-after-post the redirected url which renders the results of your search can be made friendly and short while you can use post to pass more parameters in the request to the server and avoid the long query string associated with the get url

q1.i know that post is better than put for name-value pair parameters as the get exposes it in url and post doesn t

also you can determine if someone is submitting a form or getting the form by checking if _server request_method post which is cleaner than using a get url parameter though i guess there s nothing wrong with the other approach...

usually get is a query string where data is passed through the url with variables appended to the url and post the data is passed through the request body post can pass more data then get

however i m not sure you want pass parameters via get if you have a form and url isn t callable from outside of your application post is far better

i think whoever said post is better than get when using passwords meant that the passwords would be part of the url in the get request which would obviously be bad


better method faster
get parameters are limited in size and post is better suited for this

however i ve searched for a couple days and am not getting a definitive answer and i need a better understand of this so i know no better way to get more info than to post here

in this case post may be better than get anyways

edit would doing it as a post rather than a get be better

because post method storing capacity of response is better than get response

my questions are am i right to want to use json and use a php file on the remote server that will accept it as get or is post better and what issues should i be aware of when submitting this for review through itunes

when post is better than get

using post over https is better than using get and http

edit based on questioner s comments if modifying a number in a url is all that is required to point to records the user is unauthorized to use would post perhaps be a better method to use than get

is post safer than get

ps i know i should use post but it has the exact same problem and i switched back to get to debug it faster

i think this is better done with a post redirect get so the url can be bookmarked

i could do a post but get is much faster

there are i am sure better ways to do the above and i will post here should i get to know more myself

as far as security goes post is much better than get as the data is sent behind-the-scenes rather than embedded in the url making it the typical protocol for login info

if you have the ajax use get rather than post this is simpler then you can test the response by just viewing the page with the appropriate query string

with more information i get for this i will update this post and make it better i just currently do not know what to call this

when get is better than post

use post instead of get it s better

i need to be able to get the post that have had more comments than their comment_checking_threshold between their comments_last_checked date and the current date

get is a better method in this case than post

i have seen other people asking the same question why get method is faster than post

also post is generally considered better than get for ajax calls as it doesn t have the same string length limit slightly more secure too

use post its safer than get if you use rest

if i get know some more info i will update this post

i d question whether get is the right verb here considering you need to pass a complex type it sounds like it would be better served as a post

and your post will be better than you d probably get from using the blog api ymmv but i ve yet to find a compatible editor which did everything in ways i was fully happy with if your use case and expectations are simple though you might well be happy with this module but you should probably not expect it to be very useful for a while

we can send fewer data with get method compared to post method

since i m against get and pro post which is safer method here s an example with post

you won t get it done faster or better as felix kling said in the other post

in other words i think post with x-http-method-override get header is better solution

also a post request would be better than a get if you re sending json

what i am hoping to get from this post is a better way to do this or hopefully someone can tell me why is happening i know that the latter might be hard since it can be a bunch of reasons

i don t recommend sending such parameters via url get it is better and safer if you use post form method

yes post is better than get because post data is not usualy logged by a proxy or server but it is not secure

i also found a post that suggests a less brute force method to get the urlroutingmodule to catch the combres.axd route

generaly get is shorter than post

get is faster than post

why get method is faster than post

one more thing some guys would misunderstand that post is safer than get as user can not see the sent data

better than get use post method to send and retrieve user data

post would be better and you wouldn t have to hide the get parameters

if you have nested data in your model this will soon get tricky to handle though and in that case a post is the better option

let me know if you get it working if not i ll edit this post to specify more information

and no it doesn t need to be post in fact get would be better semantically here because you re not actually making changes to stored data

and of course use post method instead of get because get is more limited

just copy the content of your code in doget to dopost it should work or else set form method get but in case of password validation post is better and write your code for validation in dopost

post has worse performance than get

this is better than using get comments api for every post to see if there is new comment

get is simpler and faster than post and can be used in most cases

i ll get better with formatting and being more specific with the post

restful services does not implement an exact way to transfer the info you can use path query string form string or even multipart data so you can do it as you want but in your case instead of using get method with all the data in the query a post or put is more appropiate and you will not hit the query string limit

you should check this thread why get method is faster than post

usually in ajax get method is faster as it doesn t involve proccessing post fields and as you are only getting information i would stick it

i am beginner in transactions and entity manager so i will just continue research to understand it better but maybe i get answer here sooner or if i find the solution i will post it

yes generally post is a better way of submitting data than get

sidenote you are using a post in this case a get would be better since you re retrieving information only

get is always faster than post

1 reading other questions about the rest method for this proposes i think that i should use get better than post

i m searching for the best method to get result with database contain more than 100000 post and more than 100000 cat

get is better for some cases but it seems to me you should use post instead

while the post method can be submitted with forms or ajax calls and it is pretty safe at least more than the get

as a pragmatist i m inclined to use get because implementing it is way simpler than post

is get method is better than post method if you use a form

i believe post is better than get

get method is used for illustration here you may find that post makes more sense for this operation

this means the amount of data you could pass by using post verb is much more than by using a query string and a get method

it is said that get method is faster than post but i don t know why is it

get method is not safer than post data never trust datas coming from the client side

you should not be using the post method for requests that contain no actual data get method is better for that

so for creating a friendship post method suits better than get

3 imho using method get would be more restful for a method called getclientjson than method post

but i believe sending data using curl with post method is better than get method

i guess post would be also fine but get is always better for our use

post makes it more indirect to intercept and read the payload than get but not safer

although putting data with post method little harder than simple get

however you cannot do anything more than get the content -- you cannot add headers cannot use post

post would spring to mind but i think get is a more appropriate method because 99 of the time you only supply a bunch of parameters to these types of actions

when you use post data is a alot more safer than get and you can send large no

as mentioned in comments use the post method instead of get because post allows much more data characters across in one message

i just want to know if i use post method for login api then is it safer than get method

instead i m using post which isn t exactly bullet proof but still a better choice than get in this case

but the post method okhttp is more slower than httpclient s post always more slower than okhttp s get method

i used get because is faster than post if you need it just to get a list of element for suggestions

edit the above is mostly wrong this blog post might get you started faster

or how is it better than post redirect get if the functions can in fact be used in solving my particular problem

since post is better suited to transfer large amounts of data or difficult formatted data it is the established standard for submitting forms but it is in no way safer unsafer or more less secure than get requests

post is not better than get

the get method is useful for passing a reasonable amount of non sensitive data between pages while the post method has less limitations and is best for more sensitive data

first get unitythread class from this post which makes it easier to call a function on the main thread from another thread

a get is a bit quicker and than a post in an ajax scenario

however it is better to do this on the php side and work more securely with post instead of get

for something like a search where you are retrieving information it might be okay but for anything that stores information the post redirect get pattern is a better approach

also as ddelnado mentions get might not be optimal for this post might be better suited

note you are using a post method but a get method seems more appropriate in your case getvotes

i already build the function to receive by get but i think via post would be better

i can t help with the coding side of your question but if you re passing in a non-url input then the post method would be more appropriate than get

and i think post is better than get


older version error
how can i get the post which have end_date older than today

update due to matthew s post i used an older version before but even after updating to 1.6.6 the version i use now i still get an error

there are lots of post about using older versions but can someone explain why i wouldn t get the newest version

note the post that was earlier marked as a duplicate how to get error event details in firefox using addeventlistener

curl commands seem to work as do some other post commands from older code but when i log out req.body all i get is

this post suggests how to get and install an older package release but nhib 3.1 doesn t seem to be available stand alone from nuget


blog steps output
these steps were taken from this blog post which contains more details about how to investigate and what output you ll get

this blog post provides more info to get started

this blog post is more detailed but unfortunately does also not mention where to get the product key

if that s the case how should i make the queries like get me the blog post which have more than 10 comments perform efficiently

this blog post explains more on how to get an access token on android


restful serialization huge
i managed to create simple restful services with get methods but i can t imagine creating post ones being much more complicated

this would make things considerably easier as the android library has native support for json serialization and making http get requests to restful urls is much simpler than http post requests it s not a huge deal but just less stuff you have to worry about


secure request data
it s not any more secure than get but the general rule is that you want get for getting information and post for changing information

post method are generally consume more secure than get because when we use get method than it can display the data in url bar.if the data is more sensitive data like password then it can be inggeris

characters post is more robust and secure than get

an add action like that would be better done as a post request partly for semantic reasons it s sending data rather than get ting it and partly to avoid annoyances like this

another reason but rather a minor one is that get is easier to exploit that post as there are more ways to trigger get request than to trigger post request

a post has broader application and is generally used to send persistent data to a server in fact prescriptively get should not be used for this purpose

note you can also use get but post is safer because the user can t change it in the url

edit2 seems as if i m wrong re post being more secure than get

post is more secure then get and data transfer size limits are also there

this response thus assumes that a request using the post verb would not use the uri to transfer sensitive information or it would be no better than get

using post data is more secure than get because with get the details would be in the query string portion of the url

i was taught from him that using get requests was better than post but after reading up i would like to switch to post my only problems is i am a little unsure how to modify my code to switch over from get

first off get is no less secure than post

using the post method isn t necessarily more secure than get

using post allows for more data to be transferred since get will append the values to the url itself

be the result of form data probably url_encoded and use the correct request method get is perfectly correct but coming from an html from post is much more common

as it s widely known that an asynchronous post request is better since the user won t get a perception that the app has crashed while it s loading the long process

first you make post request although get request is more suitable for search pupposes

following my comment on your original post here s some more information that will help you get through this

please always try to use post method for submitting data as it is more secure than get method

post is also more secure than get because you aren t sticking

post would be the better option though as get has size limitations maximum length of http get request

so i m trying to send a formula with ajax before using passport for the signup it was working after using passport the post request to ajout-membre gets redirected to with a get explain more my code

post request is a little safer than get because the parameters are not stored in browser history or in web server logs

when you do get the parametres are written to url so you can access them easily on other hand it can be rewritten by user so post is more secure way

regarding your question about safety -- the answer is post is absolutely no safer than get

however post data are not much safer than get data anyway

get requests are no less insecure than post requests

with the exception there is more data with the post than the get

param should be params and therefore your data is not being serialized which would explain why the server is rejecting your post since post requires more privileges than get presumably

supply more data upon post and receive less data upon get

you can feel like post is more secure than get all you want but it s a false premise

using post is more secure than get in the sense that data shown into the url in get request but not in post

the conclusion is remember page #2+ calls are get and the request data that you may have used and were working for post are no more valid creating a different set of conditions now reducing your recordset and creating a total count that may be 0 voiding the pagination system hence the 404

moreover in case of multpart form-data encoding which is required for file uploads but in this case get request is not an option anyway post will be more verbose

speaking of get request types you should also know that get requests tend to perform better than post

for example post request are considered more secure than get request as creating a post request is relatively harder than creating a get request

on an unencrypted connection post is no more secure than get

last to address other answers while you should use post data when modifying something it is in no way more secure than get

other than that accepting a get request might be - depending on the server side rest framework - slightly more light weight than post requests

post has more capacity it can transfer more data than get

stick with post on any action that does more than get data avoid xss-issues

from my understanding it is acceptable to supply less properties in post and upon get you receive more data id auto generated by the server

in effect post is no more secure than get

post is also more secure than get because you aren t sticking information into a url

standard post request is not more secure than get one

but generally post is slower and would be bigger in size than a get request

in my opinion post requests are not more secure than get requests and the data can be easily intercepted

also don t think post parameters are any harder to manipulate than get parameters

the get request is marginally less secure than the post request

post can send more data than get

post can hold more data and thus you probably won t get exhausted easily with length of data

post isn t more secure than get

so if your get request is longer than 255 bytes it s advised to use post requests instead

usually though post request are intended to be used for changing the state of the resource on the server so if the only thing you have to do is retrieving data a get is more appropriate

after that is done you can go into security details where get is slightly less secure than post - see the comments for details.

you can send a lot more data with a post than a get

i wouldn t call post more or less secure than get

however note that post is not much safer than get

one reason post is worse for security is that get is logged by default parameters and all data is almost universally logged by your webserver

while your ajax send a get request read more about how to post using ajax and jquery

an initial get request to a page usually costs less than subsequent post anyway so there s not much reason to avoid it

if you use post when get is more semantically correct it is less communicative of the intent of your request since post usually means you are sending a payload

post will allow the larger data set and with jquery ajax you should send the data using the data object even if you use get

get can be quicker compared to post as it is a one step request post sends headers first then the body of the request

if you edit your post to give some more information as to what is actually in your arrays you might get more useful answers

although get may seem easier even for testing purposes for json you should use post requests

use post instead of get it s more secure

as powelljf3 said post is more secure then get though it can still be gotten to

however in the comparative table i linked get is listed as less secure than post

using post prevents this particular attack but is this actually any more secure than using get

post request are safer than get but that does not mean are invulnerable

if your form is meant to create modify data you ll use post instead of get but get is easier to test

here i don t like that the body of the post request contains more different fields then the body returned from the get request - but maybe this is not a problem

one big difference links are use http get while forms can use http post thus transferring more data without encoding them to the url as parameters

however a post request is less efficient as a get request - bear that in mind and only use post if you really need to

firstly post can seem more secure than get

the post at has more information on how to get that access token

what you need to use is an xhr or ajax request to get the next 10 post it is much better to do it this way rather than hiding them and activating them as needed because even if you hide it the browser still had to download the content

in addition if you have few data to send using get will url-encode the data this means that the number of generated sent bytes will be higher than the data size itself while post will consume more byte in general because the request will additionally contain a content-type application x-www-form-urlencoded header likely a content-length header plus the same url-encoded data as get

if the post has more than 9 pictures related to it i only get data from the first 9

post is a little safer than get because the parameters are not stored in browser history or in web server logs. also data is not displayed in the url

get requests are less secure because all the parameters are visible in the url while post requests are more secure as they are not shown anywhere in the url

i do understand that get requests are less secure but in your scenario your post just doesn t seem to want to work

i am asked to apply to all the actions of one mvc project for security reason says post is more secure than get which i disagree with

i understand that get requests are meant to read data while post requests are meant to alter data if a post request is sent more than once dicey things can happen

although post is more secure as compared to get when ssl is present

edit taking into account what was said in the comments though it looks more secure and is recommended by w3 see touheed khan s answer post isn t more secure than get and as riggsfolly said

post is not any more secure than get

i am using custom delegate methods but when i run this the get request is performed earlier than the post so i cannot get the key before the get is done

i am aware that a post is better for this kind of thing but my question is is this expected from a get request

get is slightly faster because the values are sent in the header unlike the post the values are sent in the request body in the format that the content type specifies

post is absolutely not more secure than get as to man in middle attacks

a post request can include all the information that a get request does plus more which makes it seem like it should be able to do everything get can do plus more

also note that using post is absolutely not more secure than get because the request parameters aren t immediately visible in url

to get more help with that post information about your table structures and content

hence post is more secure than get

how can i get rid of the post put data getting exponentially bigger

post is no more secure than get over the http protocol

actually if you would like to retrieve specific task with all its details get request would be more suitable than post

also it seems that my view gets called more than once according to the log outputs and that is normal except it should be a post then redirect to a get but it seems to have more than one post request

a get request will be slightly smaller than a post although using websockets would give a more accurate figure

as suggested in the comments since you are saving data post is more appropriate than get

why everybody here is saying post is more secure than get when used over https

and apart from common misleading information where post is safer than get it is not

using post would be easier but it will be get request

post is not more secure than get as itâ s also send unencrypted

post data isn t inherently more secure than get data

post requests are no safer than restful requests which are no safer than get requests

i don t want to use the get request since it says in the guidelines of a restful api that it should use post for this purpose plus i might want to send more data than get can handle

post is more secure than get because you aren t showing information anywhere

post is more secure than get this is just a quick example


strings reality restful
however neither post nor get alone are more or less restful - both are strings of data just in slightly different parts of the request

in reality the post are much longer but the strings simply get cut off


users user-agents standpoint
from an interface design standpoint you want user-agents to make post and put and delete more difficult than get or at least distinctly different so that users can rely on that difference to hint when their actions might cause a change in the resource state because they are responsible for those changes

here s the solution for post variables as well which is probably trickier for more users than the get solution


able single likes.how
not able to get more than 100 post in single rest api call for the linkedin company updates

i m able get only 1000 likes of the post.the post contain more than 1000 likes.how can i get all the likes


count similar tags
i want to get similar related post that should be matching atleast 3 tags all post have more then 10 tags

i normally use something like this tag.object.annotate num_post count post .filter num_post__gt 2 to get tags with more than 2 post

based on the op s example count is unique for each id cant group so after grouping by id and cant specify the logical condition for year in i if the first value of count is less than 12 get the sequence as showed in the op s post or else return the sequence of rows assign the output to pond

rather than try and regurgitate the discussion based on similar queries i will post some links here that should get you thinking more about these issues


answers comment comments
what i am trying to figure out is how to get the post that have less than 5 questions and answers together

how can i get all post that have less than 18 comments

basically i need to get all post items having more than 5 comment


requests latency b
network latency is ruled out because get requests take more or less same time as local machine whereas time taken to first byte is more for post and put requests

the purpose of the rest api is to a store basic information about the planets in the solar system b allow get requests and c allow me to use post to add more entries in the database


request data errors
when i request the shares field i can see more than one post with shares but when i request post_id sharedposts for some of them i just get an empty data array in response

i only know method not allowed errors from a get request to a post route but that s not the case as ajax is performing a post call though there is some get data attached and more important it s working on localhost


complicated complex
post is a little more complex than get though

if you re just handling get then you can just look for n n but handling post will require something more complicated


important functions https
however if you want to get more than one post rather use functions mentioned above i think the most important thing is to grab them in one db query and not in ineffective way one-by-one

for security http vs https is more important than post vs get


cos	math.h---------------------------------------------------

others
and my test result show it s more accurate than math.h s sin cos at -m_pi angle +m_pi range


poisson	mixture---------------------------------------------------

others
so intutively it appears that to explain the variance we should go for mixture of more than two poisson distribution


goto	break---------------------------------------------------

labels restrictive equivalent
it is the equivalent of a goto but is more restrictive in that labels may be used only in break or continue statements

those break statements are being used in the same way that goto is used in older languages


good programming solution
to any seasoned developer of a c-like language break will both read better as well as provide a cleaner solution than goto

nevertheless in my opinion break is not much better than goto its both not a good programming style


others
in particular note the mention of break and continue which aren t as flexible as goto but are more flexible in bash than in some languages and may help you achieve what you want

in the cleanup even in normal case scenario i would regard the use of goto as being clearer than the do while 0 constructs among other things because the target labels themselves practically cry out look at me far moreso than the break and do while 0 constructs

continue and break are nothing more than a pleasant syntax for a goto

but break is no better or worse than goto

there are pundits who don t like break continue and the like but at some point there is a tradeoff to make between rules of thumb and readability and a well-chosen break continue or even goto may become more readable than politically correct code

but actually break has more resemblance to return both instructions jump out of a block of code which is pretty much structured in comparison to goto


end bad l
there s not really a graceful way to break out of for l although it is much faster than a goto loop

the bad we use a break that is little more than a tamed goto something like goto the end of the loop


nested loops better
but goto is better than break when you have nested loops like that

basically continue and break are better but often just disguised goto statements.

in the previous example break is better than goto

labeled break like in java would be better than goto for this purpose

the idea of saying break out of the nth nested loop is worse than a goto from a structural perspective

if you re in a nested loop and need to break out of all loops a goto can make this much cleaner and simpler than break statements and if-checks


propertychangelistener	listeners---------------------------------------------------

others
now this basically boils down to an observer pattern swing implements this kind of functionality in it s listeners changelistener springs to mind as a possible candidest but propertychangelistener is a more powerful option as it generates events based on the property that has changed


qt3d	qtopengl---------------------------------------------------

others
qt3d was developed earlier than qml became mature as an extension to the 2d world provided by the qtgui module or even qtopengl


direct3d	direct2d---------------------------------------------------

others
if you are willing to limit yourself to vista or later then direct2d would be a little simpler than direct3d

direct3d appears in principal to be easier than direct2d but has poor text font handling in the latest version

direct2d is more or less dead nowadays and one would use direct3d also to render 2d

as mentioned direct2d is an option also--it is functionally a layer on top of direct3d that supports more 2d specific functionality as well as excellent text support


clang	llvm---------------------------------------------------

others
good options are llvm libc++ static library fewer features more compatible with clang and gnu stl static library more features i had an issue that required me to turn the clang optimizer to -oz to prevent a segfault

when i compile with clang -emit-llvm -s -o3 test.c gcc would also work but the llvm ir is more readable in my opinion i get

first fiber won t compile with apple clang because of the use of thread_local which apple does not support according to what i found online they think they can implement it better than standard llvm and don t want to introduce it only to break abi later

essentially there s no need for gcc any more llvm + clang is more than enough

llvm compiles code faster than gcc may create code that runs faster and the clang frontend provides more accurate error messages than gcc â so there are definitely reasons for switching

the reference c++ program with input 28 compiled with llvm 8.0.0 runs in 0.67s on my machine the same with clang 3.7 is marginally slower 0.68s

libstdc++ does this a lot more than libc++ and the former is the default library for llvm-g++ gcc llvm the latter for clang apple llvm which means a lot of errors will seem to go away when you switch to gcc llvm or just stick with apple llvm and switch your library but your code is still wrong


jlist	jlayeredpane---------------------------------------------------

others
the listener to the jlayeredpane component makes fast successive calls the listener to the jlist calls significantly slower


uiview	cashapelayer---------------------------------------------------

others
by doing this not only do i avoid drawrect inefficiencies but one could theoretically also change how you use this cashapelayer use it as a mask for some uiview revealing some more interesting color gradation or other image behind it

you can use a bezier path either in a custom uiview w drawrect or easier with a cashapelayer whose curvature can be controlled via its control points

i think that either a coregraphics implementation or this cashapelayer implementation make more sense than png files or uiview objects with rounded corners


teamcity	ncover---------------------------------------------------

others
it turns out there is an issue with the fullreport with ncover 3 and teamcity 7 read more about it below


move	drag---------------------------------------------------

others
this is easy to implement with buttons select items click up or down buttons to move - just loop through and apply the move to each selected item but much more difficult with drag reordering

textbox autosizes to its content that s ok but when drag apperas the listboxitem becomes wider and move other items it s not ok

by setting the move distance to 4000 i am basically saying if your drag is less than 4000 treat it as a click

a mouse-down followed by a mouse-move is a drag if the move is greater than some threshold to allow for human motion while clicking

i use all the events for the drag operation so maybe the initial move is less laggy perceptually in this case

in other words if i press the image and there is no move recorded for more then 1s nothing happens during this time but if i suddenly move the finger i already see the resized image but if i start moving in less then 1s i see how the image gets resized in the way while i drag it

i got a draggable object done with jquery ui and when i drag it it s way slower than i move my mouse

the overall effect is that the drag force increases as the spaceship move faster making it harder to accelerate in the direction of motion when the ship move faster


thumb press table
i reimplemented the mouse move press and release events for the inner widget in order to be able to move it inside its bigger parent with drag drop

it ends up in a state of confusion...you basically cannot release the drag of the table it keeps getting bigger and smaller as you move your mouse - but you can never let go and release it to get the size you want

but if he move the mouse cursor away from the slider while he is still dragging the slider s thumb the drag speed is lower


heroku	engineyard---------------------------------------------------

others
engineyard does provide application-level support too which is a fair bit better than what heroku does

engineyard also seems like a great company but i think they hold your hand a little less than heroku


full-service traditional servers
in choosing heroku is more full-service whereas engineyard is a more traditional service giving you access to boxes but needing sysadmin skills

engineyard are more like heroku in that they aren t just providing you with servers they are providing you with a service and set up stuff for you


x86	mips---------------------------------------------------

others
if you pick up something like mips and get the hang of it x86 is less of a monster to learn

x86 have more exceptions for register usage than mips that you have to keep in mind but nothing worth whining about constantly

a better bet might be to install spim and to learn mips assembly which is more straightforward than x86 anyways

mips is much more orthogonal than x86 could ever dream of being

however in most computer architectures there are at least 2 registers to return values that are twice or more as wide as the word size edx eax in x86 rdx rax in x86_64 v0 and v1 in mips why mips assembler has more that one register for return value

yes it is very true that an x86 can have a lower clock and run faster than some other x86 historically the newer ones can do less stuff per clock than older ones for the same binaries you have to then tune the compile to the newer chip and then you might get back some of your mips to mhz


output complex architecture
the wording in your question seems to suggest you don t care as much that the output is mips but rather you want the output to be less complex than x86

i have studied the x86 assembly and architecture and it appears to be a lot more complicated than mips

x86 have more complex instructions than mips


arm intel architectures
this could include a emulator for a 68000 or mips which are arguably nicer assembly instruction sets than the venerable cisc instruction set of the intel x86 16 32-bit

do any of the other common architectures like arm mips sparc etc have an easier than x86 instruction set

if you have not programmed assembly before i suggest you choose mips since it is easier than x86 and then b looking at how to transfer data with the serial port to begin with since this illustrates memory-mapped i o that is used


activemq	rabbitmq---------------------------------------------------

others
lot s of free stuff available look for anything implementing amqp for example and not limited to apache s attempt - activemq zeromq as listed above rabbitmq which is more complete than zero and even red hat are in the game with red hat messaging

i use activemq in prod and fine with it but for very highroad rabbitmq will be better

apache activemq which is way more popular than qpid or rabbitmq - or indeed any jms provider would work just fine


easy worse sense
what does rabbitmq do better or worse than activemq

it seems activemq is better than rabbitmq in the sense that it is easy to set up and maintenance for cluster


ostream	ostringstream---------------------------------------------------

others
ostream is more general subclasses support writing to different places ostringstream is a specific one writing to a string


debian-based	ubuntu---------------------------------------------------

others
in my experience ubuntu and other debian-based oses are much more trouble-free developer environments for almost everything except c# and .net stuff


fadein	fadeout---------------------------------------------------

others
more detail set the amount of time the animation will take for fadeout and use a delay for the fadein animation that is longer than the fadeout animation time


crfsuite	crf++---------------------------------------------------

others
crfsuite is faster than crf++ and it can deal with a huge training data


vlan	packets---------------------------------------------------

others
udp packets smaller than the mtu will not be fragmented but the mtu depends on more factors such as ip options and vlan headers so it may not be greater than 1500


redmine	chiliproject---------------------------------------------------

others
chiliproject 1.x and redmine are on older versions of rails 2.3.5 and 2.3.11 and don t use bundler at all


lz77	lzw---------------------------------------------------

others
if so what is the nature of the output of lz77 that makes it more suitable for huffman compression than lzw or some other method entirely


pygtk	pygobject---------------------------------------------------

others
it looks like python-mpdor is using gtk 2 which would be pygtk as opposed to newer gtk 3 which is pygobject


kate	gedit---------------------------------------------------

others
you can customize kate and i think you will like it better than gedit

if vim seems too much by the moment i think that kate is better than gedit


cocos2d-x	corona---------------------------------------------------

others
i would recommend cocos2d-x as it is in my opinion equally or even better than corona and it is free

the consensus seems to be that corona is easier to use but that cocos2d-x has the advantages that come from being open source easy to customize merge with other code community etc


qqmlapplicationengine	qquickview---------------------------------------------------

others

headline newer powerful
since qqmlapplicationengine is newer than qquickview one would naturally assume that it is more powerful

headline qqmlapplicationengine is newer and more powerful than qquickview


vb.net	vb6---------------------------------------------------

others
vb.net seems to think lots of things are objects one way or another but vb6 has stronger typing in this case

avoiding them by modifying vb6 is lot easier than fixing the issues in vb.net

one comment though - while it would be possible to do this in vb.net using the illustrated techniques doing it in vb6 would be much harder or even impossible

none of the .net libraries are there and there are some syntax differences as vb.net is more strict than vb6 is

you can access apis with c# vb.net although it is a bit tedious something like vb6 would be surprisingly quicker to develop around the api functions although its clunky for general coding

especially as vb6 is becoming more and more of a distant memory and the vb.net language takes on a life of its own in conjunction with the core .net framework advancing

so i have a rather complicated application written in legacy vb6 that i have been tasked to update to current vb.net to work on more machines

quite apart from the fact that the language vb.net is far more feature rich than vb6 the fact that you have developed in vb.net means that you have made extensive use of the .net class libraries including system.security.cryptography that you give as an example

also developing enterprise application is such new languages java c# vb.net rubby is easier that vb6 because they rely on frameworks every body can write c# java code that function but it requires tricks good practices and some of imagination to write vb6 strong and rehusable code

can i safely assume that vb.net result is more precise than vb6 and discard the vb6 result completely

bear in mind when converting types from vb6 to vb.net that the numeric types in vb.net are larger

the style was common in vb6 with optional parameters but imho and according to microsoft in vb.net overloading is usually more elegant than optional parameters

in vb.net the default behaviour is the same as vb6 to make it easier to upgrade legacy code

can somebody explain how it can be that the same api call returns so much quicker with vb6 than with vb.net

vbscript is much more convenient than creating an activex on vb6 or c# vb.net

however i ve noticed that running the vb6 tools is becoming more and more painful over time so i m looking at the possibility of migrating this code to vb.net 2008

if it is useful to you you are more than welcome to it note i m more familiar with vb6 vba than vb.net so this udf is more in the vba style but still works in vb.net

vb.net appears much more complex then vb6 and the learning curve is tough

the differences between vb and vb.net are even bigger by some metrics because no complete vb6 code is valid vb.net

yes they are different but you can hardly say that the vb.net version is less capable than the vb6 version

i assume the same control in vb.net would be datagridview and i m fairly sure that you can probably make it look better than in vb6 but if you want really good looking ones you might want to look at thirdparty grid controls

vb.net might be easier to learn if you come from a pure vb6 background but i ve found most web developers with a bit of js experience can pick up the c# syntax easily enough

getting your project migrated to vb.net is certainly easier when you keep the old vb6 controls


end point back
if you don t already know vb6 there s little point in learning it now - your time could be put to much better use by learning vb.net c#

biggest of all is that adding new features to your vb6 application is more expensive than it would be if the application was in a better language like c# or vb.net

coming from familiarity with vb6 c# and vb.net are the same on the back end and vb.net would be a better choice for you i prefer c# if you care

vb.net is a better language than vb6 use its com capabilities to save you from writing endless sketchy vb6 code


refreshing net knowledge
fortunately vb.net finally ended all that and is completely pixel based you can still alter you viewport scaling but .net seems to handle that much better than vb6

the time and energy you spend refreshing your knowledge of vb6 would be far better spent on learning vb.net


nsstring	nsdata---------------------------------------------------

others
however converting from nsstring to nsdata gives more reliable json data


lwjgl	slick2d---------------------------------------------------

others
slick2d is made to work with lwjgl 2 lwjgl 3 however is way newer than slick2d and therefore slick2d does not support using lwjgl 3

you could use slick2d it is way easier to use and works with lwjgl

on one hand slick2d is fast and simple but it seems lwjgl is more adaptable in the sense that it has both 2d and 3d capabilities

i ve been delving into game programming with slick2d and i ve began to wonder if in the long run knowing lwjgl would be more helpful


virtualenv	conda---------------------------------------------------

others
if you are using anaconda conda is a better alternative to virtualenv as it manages conda packages which are not limited to just python packages

i am using conda i thought using conda should be better than setting up via virtualenv but looks like this is really a pain

an additional bonus i find that conda works better as a package manager than virtualenv


powerful easier general
conda environments are easier to manage than virtualenv environments in my opinion

conda environments are more general and powerful than those provided by virtualenv


flyway	liquibase---------------------------------------------------

others
liquibase seems to have everything flyway has and more flexibility when it comes to rollbacks

the downside is that you are losing the big part of the flyway s appeal in its simplicity and technically could be better off by using liquibase s dsl


lxml	suds---------------------------------------------------

others
but it s probably easier to at least use an xml lib such as lxml or a dedicated soap library such as suds to make this easier


cdr	cons---------------------------------------------------

others
as a practical matter a cons is simpler than a list so you can get the value with a straight cdr rather than the conceptually more complex cadr the car of the cdr

when dealing with lists think of car as the first element of the list and cdr as the rest of the elements and cons adds one more element at the head of the list - that element can be anything including another list

hons generally runs slower than cons because in creating a hons an attempt is made to see whether a hons already exists with the same car and cdr


filewriter	bufferedwriter---------------------------------------------------

others
the other surprise that i have found when writing these types of systems is that in later versions of java using bufferedwriter can be slower than just using filewriter directly or randomaccessfile

i have coded a routine to compute the cartesian product of different tables as in a database with the only exception that the tables are stored as files in my case and for computing the cartesian product i am using file i o for reading files i am using filereader coupled with bufferedreader and for writing files i am using filewriter coupled with bufferedwriter now as i am performing every computation externally in files i.e i compute the product as follows i take a row from file-1 which is table-1 in my case and concatenate it with every other row in file-2 which is table-2 in my case and write it to an external file which holds the result

so using filewriter wrapped in a bufferedwriter to make it easier to write a new line


cobertura	jacoco---------------------------------------------------

others

answer better easier
the other answer mentions cobertura but jacoco may be easier to set up

you are better off with jacoco than cobertura

similarly you might find using jacoco easier than cobertura


hide	removeclass---------------------------------------------------

others
i would use addclass removeclass instead of show hide to get better control


sse	avx2---------------------------------------------------

others
currently compiling using the 128 bit sse instructions this is faster than all s but using the 256 bit avx2 setting was slower even with all s

and simd math libraries for sse and avx however they seem to be more sse than avx2


dateadd	datepart---------------------------------------------------

others
case cast convert current_timestamp dateadd datediff datename datepart getdate isdate left len lower ltrim replace replicate reverse right rtrim space str substring substring expression start length sysdatetime upper


pkcs#12	pfx---------------------------------------------------

others
i resolved the problem the point is that a pkcs#12 file as a pfx contains more then 1 certificate so it must be loaded in this way


mousemove	mouseenter---------------------------------------------------

others
mousemove is more intrusive than mouseenter but it tracks your mouse position all the time so that the tooltip moves accordingly

problably the problem is that mousemove event may fire earlier than mouseenter in some cases


orb	keypoint---------------------------------------------------

others
its however best to used flann based matchers for sift or surf since they extract a higher number of keypoint as compared to orb and flann is suited to large sets of keypoint read more about it here

i am wondering why brisk detector detects much less keypoint than the orb detector


kivy	pyqt---------------------------------------------------

others
if you don t plan to move to mobiles later tkinter or pyqt may be a better choice than kivy


vaadin	wicket---------------------------------------------------

others
with this in mind customizing the css of a wicket app is significantly easier than vaadin for the simple reason that you control the markup

this is only a guess and is not based on actual performance testing probably wicket will be doing better than vaadin

wicket probably has more resources than vaadin

i would say vaadin would be easier over wicket as the default ui elements look really good


prop	classname---------------------------------------------------

others
basically i have a shared component that is used across the app and accepts a classname as a prop to get more styles on the parent basic


nsscanner	nsnumberformatter---------------------------------------------------

others
i was originally using nsscanner because it was easier than nsnumberformatter to use but i ran into the same problem it doesn t parse the entire string just the first number in the string


primefaces	icefaces---------------------------------------------------

others
i did my part of the research and found out that either richfaces or primefaces would be better but most of my applications were developed using icefaces


uitabbaritem	uibaritem---------------------------------------------------

others
uitabbaritem is a subclass of uibaritem everything is more painful because uibaritem doesn t subclass uiview


vlookup	sumifs---------------------------------------------------

others
bear in mind that index is the same as vlookup in that it will only return the first value if two tenders finished on the same day it will only return the first it comes across if you have more than one maybe sumifs would work better maybe along side countif to show how many there were


mapquest	directions---------------------------------------------------

others
as accuracy goes i ve noticed that for directions here in north carolina mapquest is slightly more accurate


laravel	yii---------------------------------------------------

others
according to my experience yii is easy to use but it has some pros and cons too every framework has but i used laravel on some projects and i think laravel is much more better than yii

yii is good but laravel can do better than it

developers community it might seem that laravel has a larger community of developers but during my career with yii i ve found no bottleneck of having a question without an answer


nsfilemanager	nsdocument---------------------------------------------------

others
if you do not wish to use it you ll have to drop support for nsdocument and use a lower level abstraction like nsfilemanager + nsfileversion


csc	vbc---------------------------------------------------

others
so yes at least in this respect csc is smarter than vbc


cpu	affinity---------------------------------------------------

others
running the test on a single cpu was significantly faster â œforcedâ by setting thread affinity with setthreadaffinitymask and checked with getcurrentprocessornumber

while it would be highly unfeasible to create a test that would exercise every possible code path in tpl you can certainly setup a test that would benefit from many available cores set the affinity mask to 1 cpu and observe through task manager that the affinity never changes and cpu utilization is never more than 1 n where n is the # of cores present


gitolite	gitosis---------------------------------------------------

others
that being said i find gitolite much more complete than gitosis like all those recent blog posts illustrate

gitosis which is no longer in active development and you should be using gitolite but this answer applies to both of them stores each user s public keys in in your case gitosis .ssh authorized_keys

gitolite is far more advanced than gitosis and is quite easy to install directly from your workstation based on ssh communication with your git repository server

gitolite is maintained has a dozen features more than gitosis and the author actually responds to emails

either way gitolite is easier to maintain and more up-to-date than gitosis see how do programs like gitolite work

gitosis which is obsolete for a few years now gitolite is much richer works with bare repos repos without a working tree


best better
for this the best option is gitolite better than gitosis

i know gitolite better than gitosis


ctime	posix---------------------------------------------------

others
on a posix system copying over an older file would result in ctime being newer even if mtime is older


bpmn	jbpm---------------------------------------------------

others
besides i would be glad to hear your ideas about if the improvements of activiti bpmn will make it better or useful than jbpm as time goes on


richfaces	icefaces---------------------------------------------------

others
i did my part of the research and found out that either richfaces or primefaces would be better but most of my applications were developed using icefaces

that said i found icefaces to be a useful product and much better than richfaces especially in terms of the quality of the documentation

there is icefaces which provides more semantic support than richfaces .also you can try nitobi suite which also provides similar kinda solution.if you are not satisfied with any of these i suggest try to write your own part extending the sun faces

my personal experience with both richfaces mixed better with other jsf libs icefaces has more advanced ajax capabilities like server sided push kinda like comet the basic ajax functionality is easier to set up and use but plays difficult sometimes when you mix it with other jsf libs


components better easy
richfaces has better ajax support than icefaces

richfaces looks more good option to work than icefaces bcoz it has inbuilt support its easy to learn its long time support guarantee for seam+richfaces combination

icefaces provides more good looking components than richfaces


strcpy	strdup---------------------------------------------------

others
in current code you actually don t really copy you will have to do strcpy buffer s unless using the strdup mentioned earlier

in general it is nicer in c to have the caller allocate memory not the callee - hence why strcpy is a nicer function in my opinion than strdup


convenient faster result
or indeed if your system has strdup or you re willing to write an implementation then strdup is much cleaner than malloc + strcpy

because of the above replace strdup with strlen malloc memcpy memcpy is slightly faster than strcpy

additionally if you have strdup then it is much more convenient than strlen + malloc + strcpy with identical result including the same obligation to free the allocated storage when you no longer need it


xml-rpc	json-rpc---------------------------------------------------

others
json-rpc is more pythonic than xml-rpc or shudder soap


uitableview	uipickerview---------------------------------------------------

others
uitableview is much more customizable than uipickerview

perhaps a uipickerview or a uitableview might be better alternatives to radio buttons

the uipickerview is nothing more than a uiview with one or more uitableview and background and selector views

there are some libs that are using uitableview to simulate a more flexible uipickerview


sum	coalesce---------------------------------------------------

others
i m pretty sure the linker will coalesce equivalent strings so the total will be less than the sum of the parts for these sections but i guess typically not by much


swrl	owl---------------------------------------------------

others
drools and jess have a higher power than swrl but protã gã supports swrl in that it supports owl so the use case is to support multiple swrl implementations


nuxeo	documentum---------------------------------------------------

others
nuxeo is based on open source but you have to pay the license and is pretty expensive at this point documentum is better anyway


uibinder	smartgwt---------------------------------------------------

others
while smartgwt has much more sophisticated widgets than gwt you still can t use uibinder in conjunction with it which is why i rejected using smartgwt


ssl	spdy---------------------------------------------------

others
if we assume that you live in a poor coverage area and your phone and your tower are constantly dropping the signal then re-establishing a spdy connection is no worse off than re-establishing a tcp connection modulo ssl handshake

plus once spdy becomes more common ssl slow down won t really account for anything much

i m using keep-alive so i think the ssl handshake is more or less totally out but i hope to move to spdy soon so i don t really know how that helps after the initial handshake


peer	p2p---------------------------------------------------

others
also to be noted that p2p networks get stronger the more they grow you could aswell implement that peer already connected to the network and reachable from the outside help those others to connect to the other peers.you should look up p2p relaying and hole punching


emacs	gedit---------------------------------------------------

others
i don t know anything about except that it s more powerful than gedit but doesn t have the same feel as vim emacs


printf	strtod---------------------------------------------------

others
a fairer comparison would be comparing stringstream to the printf sscanf line of functions which would be slower than strtod but still faster than stringstream


freebsd	linux---------------------------------------------------

others
be aware that the bourne shell in freebsd is more capable than on linux

i d expect that freebsd would be more stable least changing from release to release than either linux or s11e

tail -f that is capital -f as opposed to lowercase -f is a non-standard flag available on linux cygwin macos x freebsd and netbsd that works better for watching log files which may be rotated occasionally

linux containers and freebsd jails are a better alternative to chroot

just a tip but from personal experience i ve found that freebsd works much better on low-end hardware than a modern linux distro does


prefuse	jung---------------------------------------------------

others
somehow the layout algorithms in prefuse seem to display a better layout than in jung rendering is also better i think though most of the layout algorithms in prefuse are based on jung implementation


realloc	calloc---------------------------------------------------

others
you probably only need one call to calloc when you pass it that big numbers whereas realloc can accept smaller increments


istream	ostringstream---------------------------------------------------

others
if further stream will not be used to read values from it it s istream part won t be used ostringstream is more suitable


freemarker	velocity---------------------------------------------------

others
velocity is worse than freemarker and stringtemplate has got its own issues

i suggest using a template engine such as freemarker for this or velocity but freemarker is better imo

i m trying to create a template in velocity since i have more knoledge than freemarker

from my experience of both i would suggest that velocity is a little bit simpler but freemarker is more powerful

freemarker provides much better native whitespace handling recent velocity releases provide more interesting content controls #define #evaluate # literal block #

freemarker is more powerful than velocity

freemarker is more advanced but a little complex as compared to apache velocity


best better simpler
also note that velocity is not the best option going forward freemarker would be a better way to go

velocity is simpler than freemarker


whirlpool	md5---------------------------------------------------

others
at best it is a computationally expensive hash function like whirlpool that for example is five times slower than md5 and thus allows only a fifth of the number of hash operations in opposite to md5


runtimeexception	unchecked-exception---------------------------------------------------

others
using throw new runtimeexception e is simpler to comprehend than throwables.propagate in the scenario where you want to throw an unchecked-exception wrapping a checked exception

unchecked-exception which extend runtimeexception are more common and don t have the necessary verbose syntax

note better than just runtimeexception would be to use a more specific unchecked-exception if one is available

unchecked-exception that are expected more or less same as above some people like to throw subclasses of runtimeexception instead of exception


opus	speex---------------------------------------------------

others
it will continue to be available but since opus is better than speex in all aspects users are encouraged to switch


rcharts	devtools---------------------------------------------------

others
not sure what colors you want but if you have installed the newer rcharts with devtools install_github ramnathv rcharts here is how you might color based on the source value with a demo here


irrlicht	ogre3d---------------------------------------------------

others
ogre3d seems to be more mature than irrlicht judging by the amount of applications and games that is


nullpointerexception	runtimeexception---------------------------------------------------

others
a note on the runtimeexception re if you catch a nullpointerexception nullpointerexception and throw a re you are actually losing information since nullpointerexception is a more specific error rather than re

you probably had an exception possibly a runtimeexception such as a nullpointerexception which stopped further invocations


int	boolean---------------------------------------------------

others
a boolean would most likely not yield better performance than int since the excel formula engine is dynamically typed

in the getvalue flag you convert the value of the flag route data entry to an int and then to a boolean depending if the int is greater than zero

keep in mind however that following the robustness principle of be conservative in what you send liberal in what you accept the interpretation of int in the boolean context is somewhat more relaxed

any data type witch is lower than int except boolean is implicitly converts to int

if i convert these vectors into string with whitespace-separated numbers i would be able to use boolean query with should statements for this search but i think that using arrays of int should be faster

int allow more flexibility while boolean offer limitation and simplicity

as for variables each variable is a reference and will take up 8 bytes of memory even if it stores nothing int will generally only take up 4 bytes and boolean are even more optimized but these are special cases

what that code is doing is first checking if then casting the resulting boolean to an int will be 0 or 1 and finally checking if that int is less than maxx which it will always be

boolean true is more meaningful than int or chars 1

from the link which is mentioned in question my question is that microsoft says the c# type keywords and their aliases are interchangeable but why we need aliases from my point of view boolean is more meaningful then bool and int32 is more meaningful then int then why aliases

which is invalid as a boolean cannot be less than an int

so boolean operation is quite longer than for int or float

also your examples about why int would be better than boolean are kinda flawed

side note number is my string that is the user s input and int is a boolean declared earlier in the code

but wait it s not really constant for boolean arrays and why does int array indexing take longer last case than boolean array indexing even if it has to process 5 times less elements

no int are not easier on the processor the processor does fundamental boolean logic operations on bits

in that sense boolean are much closer to one-bit int than to enums

accessing a byte boolean can be more work than accessing an int or long so if performance is the only consideration a int or long can be faster

i sometimes find that using boolean in int expressions make for shorter and simpler code

the int version seems to execute much faster than the boolean one

returning boolean or an int is more of a c mindset than a java in java you would just handle the exception one

in high-level programming languages the choice between a boolean and an int is really more of code readability supportability than one of efficiency

keep in mind that depending on the use and on the system using it while a boolean takes less space because it s just a single bit depending on the implementation an int is the native word size of the hardware

second other data types like int require more bits to represent so they are going to take up more room in the stream than boolean

notice that for the test is true and could give 1 the conversion of the true boolean to an int which is less than 10


able error method
to be able to express what you were trying to do the operator would have to be able to do more than just boolean because right now your has a bool and int around it

you can encode up to 32 boolean in an int as follows the method won t error on more than 32 boolean s but won t be able to unpack correctly


memory effieicnt vector
first off if your dataset only consists of 3-digit int then a simple array of 1000 boolean will be much more memory effieicnt than a map

i m writing a program for a class where the basic problem is using a vector of unsigned int and bitwise operation to imitate a vector of boolean but use much less memory

the mask arrays boolean arrays being much more memory efficient than int or float arrays might bring about more performance boost


sets strings type-safe
they are much more type-safe than int strings or sets of boolean flags

they are much more type-safe than int strings or sets of boolean


types expressions operands
objects or expressions of an int type whose int conversion rank is less than or equal to the rank of int and unsigned int roughly speaking any smaller int type such as boolean or chars types

types narrower than int are widened to int in expressions anyway - so the boolean operators would still work on int operands


bytes smaller small
a handy mnemonic is that the small version of the boolean and works on smaller pieces bits instead of bytes chars int etc

int can be smaller than 8 bytes and boolean take 0 bytes


values value type
if you need more you will have to use a larger int system.int64 create more than one enumeration and chain them together or just create a class with a bunch of boolean values

the tablemodel column visibility boolean and column width int or double had better be somewhere in your model

the boolean values will be true or false depending on whether the given floor int is higher or equal true to the values in somenumbers i or lower false

if the boolean value is true and the length of the string is greater than the int value print the sum of the float and the int

perhaps using int type if values are all numeric would work better than boolean for a and b

if a value in the double array is less than the int value at the same position of the two dimensional array then in that part of the boolean array the value would is true

so the best approach here is either to use a wider type than int number or pass some flag boolean value to function as well as int to indicate actual value absence

but counting the number of trues in a boolean array is more difficult since the accumulated type int differs from the source type bool


space value values
would a boolean array of size 32 take more space than an int variable for example

since the logic is the same i thought evaluating boolean objects takes more time than int equivalence true 1 and false 0 therefore i came up with the following benchmark and it turns out that i was correct

int occupy more memory than boolean so the heap got corrupted

one example where an int could be more efficient than a boolean would be in a relational database

it returns a boolean value true if the elements in the list contains at least one int and no more than six int whose values range between 1 and 6

however the second loop causes the additional task of casting each of the values between a.length and 0 to a boolean which is more time consuming than int comparison

in language where int that are not 0 represents the boolean value true and 0 false like c i will tend to use because it represents the same meaning as if int whereas represents more the int value being equal to 1 rather than the boolean true

a boolean takes less space than an int

i recommend using an int to keep track of states with more states boolean become harder to manage and it s easier to make mistakes

for instance will a variable that has a boolean value take up less space than one that has an int value

since your patterns are just 0 and 1 values you can think of them as numeric values long is a 64bit int which is more than enough which can be converted later to a boolean matrix

since a boolean is stored as a 16-bit int it is easier to toggle between true and false states by simply not ing all of the bits rather than only not ing the least significant of the bits

i always assumed that boolean were more efficient than int at storing an on off value - considering that s their reason for existence

it is saying this because using the int to store the value 32 bits is going to use less space than a boolean 256 as each allocated boolean will take up 8 bits 8 256 2048

to hold up to 16 boolean you could use a byte array with two bytes or a single int depending on whether the overhead of an array or the unused bits in the int take up more space


happy	cup---------------------------------------------------

others
i will be happy to hear more insights regarding what causes the extra time to elapse - 10msec sounds as eternity for a modern cpu - though i am not familiar with the specs of the ipod cpu it s ipod 4g and wikipedia says the cup is powervr sgx gpu 535 200 mhz


128bit	64bit---------------------------------------------------

others
i wrote this brute-force converter but your values don t seem to exactly match up with .net type precision - double 64bit is too low precision and decimal 128bit is more

perhaps 128bit distributed-system internet-wide pointers but no more than 64bit in a system call or perhaps even a legacy 32-bit limit

so a 128bit adder will be slower than a 64bit add

excel cannot process data more than 64bit big it will store it in powers of 10 but in our application i want 128bit data for that i have formatted particular cell to be text format in excel sheet so that i can enter very big number

so it looks like the simd implementations give a 2x or more improvement over 64bit scalar code although 256 bit simd doesn t seem to give any improvement over 128bit simd and that typical throughput should be a lot faster than 5 gb s

if you re using gcc and the version you have supports 128bit numbers try using __uint128_t than performing the 128 multiply and extracting the upper 64bit is likely to be the most efficient way of getting the result

128bit transactions tend to be faster than 64bit which tend to be faster than 32 bit

in a few more years there might be an architecture where 128bit math is faster than 64bit but i don t think any exists today

pkcs#5 padding technically is not defined for block sizes larger than 64bit aes uses 128bit blocks

so make sure you code has a working set of less than 16 128bit vectors or 32 64bit vectory at any time

in a benchmark test the 128bit intrinsic function performs faster than the 64bit intrinsic

some wider instructions like sse2 128bit wide or double float 64bit wide are faster or sometimes will not work for alignment of native width if you need to load 128bit data you should align it in 128bit

gcc supports built-in __int128_t and __uint128_t types on 64bit platforms but it looks like formatting support for 128bit integers is less common in libc

the emulated 128bit integers are slower than the hardware 64bit integers. specific changes


solution previous comment
i ll just add that if the 128bit number is prime or has a prime factor larger than 64bit then there will be no solution to your problem

and i ll just add to previous comment if 128bit number has prime factor larger than 64bit then it certainly has a factor less than 64bit


xslt	xquery---------------------------------------------------

better class dimitre
as dimitre says xslt is much better at this class of problem than xquery

i hate to answer a request for a solution in language a by suggesting a solution in language b but what you are doing here falls into the class of problems which xslt handles much better than xquery


others
also with xquery you can re-use your existing skills with xslt + xpath as the languages have a lot in common but xquery is more geared towards database access

my usual rule-of-thumb is that xquery is better than xslt for simple tasks whereas xslt is better for complex tasks

the xdm model used by xslt xpath xquery is much stricter it allows a free-standing zero-length text node but as soon as you try and add such a node to a tree it disappears

if your output is going to be similar to your input with small changes then the xslt solution is often a lot simpler than the xquery solution

generally i know it sounds banal xslt is better at transformation generating a new document from each source document while xquery is better at query extracting a small amount of information from each source document

nowadays with xquery there is no reason to use xslt anymore xquery is much nicer

a solution in xslt would work too but if you are not already using xslt then using xquery makes more sense here i guess

setting the xhtml namespace as the default namespace might be useful though sadly in xquery this also makes it the default namespace for the output - xslt does this better

the flwr syntax of xquery is quite intuitive if you have an sql back-ground imo xslt is the more powerful language when dealing with one input one output situations especially if the output will not be xml

xquery is more amenable to static analysis than xslt because it lacks the very dynamic template despatch mechanism

probably more popular than xquery is xpath which is the basis of xslt transform

unless you are using the static typing feature xquery is no more strongly typed than xslt

xquery works better than xslt for this because it s more amenable to static analysis as it lacks the polymorphism of xslt s template rules


xml convenient simpler
i think xquery would be more convenient if you had all of your xml in a database but on the filesystem xslt may be simpler

what you try to achieve is certainly possible with xquery or with xslt which is more convenient for transforming xml trees especially for multiple transform passes


kind processing expressive
xslt is significantly more appropriate to use than xquery for such kind of tasks

this kind of processing is most easily done with xslt which is more expressive than xquery


hammer.js	fastclick.js---------------------------------------------------

others
hammer.js is a more full-featured touch library has many swipe commands than fastclick.js most upvoted answer


goose	boilerpipe---------------------------------------------------

others
2 readability library content is passable slower on average than goose but faster than boilerpipe


ubuntu	mint---------------------------------------------------

others
i applied some delay 100ms to loopback interface using netem tc command on a ubuntu machine mint to be more specific


capitalize	uppercase---------------------------------------------------

others
as a rule of thumb it is recommended to write labels as capitalize and relationship types in uppercase thus achieving a better readability

based on what i ve thrown at it names with first letters capitalize will become lower case only if it isn t followed by another by another uppercase letter

for some purposes lowercasing everything is better because it lowers the sparsity of the data uppercase words are rarer and might confuse the system unless you have a massive corpus such that the statistics on capitalize words are decent


packets	pcap---------------------------------------------------

others
note the bit that says so fewer than cnt packets may be processed - it s up the the pcap implementation what it does

this should give you a little bit of leverage however the last few packets may get lost lower the value in the if statement to mitigate this. suggest using it on both sides at the same time so each pcap should line up later on you can use mergepcap as mike suggests to if you like

i am working with pcap in c and comparing the lengths of eapol handshakes with those get in wireshark and the eapol packets captured with pcap are longer


jtable	jinternalframe---------------------------------------------------

others
i ve found that in my jtable which is in a jscrollpane nested in a jinternalframe there can be issues with scrolling and resizing when the jtable was larger than the jscrollpane


requestfactory	gwt---------------------------------------------------

others
with requestfactory you pay an up-front startup cost to accommodate more complicated systems than gwt rpc easily supports

from gwt 2.1 requestfactory is better counterpart than gwt rpc when you use db4o together

i recently got it to the point where i can retrieve data with a cursor see this link gwt pass objectify cursor from server to client with requestfactory and show more pages in datagrid


toupper	uppercase---------------------------------------------------

others
we uppercase this with toupper then we add on the next 3 characters of the string starting at the 4th character which we force in to lower case with tolower


urwid	ncurses---------------------------------------------------

others
easier than ncurses would be to use urwid

you can use python ncurses it s a part of standard library on nix systems or you can use urwid that is a higher level library for creating console interfaces

if ncurses is not enough for some undescribed reason pycdk or urwid could be better suited to your needs


metaclass	subclassing---------------------------------------------------

others
i think this is better done with a metaclass in order to handle both runtime and subclassing method decoration

you could then wrap this up in a metaclass to make it easier for people who are subclassing

it s a little less magic than metaclass but it also means you re going to have to remember to decorate each subclassing


uitableview	uipageviewcontroller---------------------------------------------------

others
in my app i have a rootpageviewcontroller which contains the uipageviewcontroller and one or more detailpageviewcontroller with a uitableview as a childview


ccmenuitem	cclabelttf---------------------------------------------------

others
if i create the same cclabelttf once then i can t add it to more than one ccmenuitem because it will give runtime error about label already added


grouplayout	miglayout---------------------------------------------------

others
you could also use grouplayout which i like better but which is harder for some to wrap their heads around...but if you re not opposed to adding a 3rd party library i m using miglayout for most everything these days


primes	square-root---------------------------------------------------

others
iterate over the primes already found which are less than the square-root of p


sbt	scala-ide---------------------------------------------------

others
it d be really nice if scala-ide supported tighter integration with sbt


realloc	malloc---------------------------------------------------

use space earlier
in the above code i attempt to make a pointer to a dynamic array of structs unsure if i succeeded in that part but my main concern is i use malloc to create space on the heap for the array people. later in the code i create another struct person and use realloc to create more space on the heap for people. i then write to memory outside of what i thought i gave space for by doing people 5 .someone rob

the standard way to do this is to use malloc to allocate an array of some size and start reading into it and if you run out of array before you run out of characters that is if you don t reach eof before filling up the array pick a bigger size for the array and use realloc to make it bigger

now you either use realloc or assign a bigger space to pointer1 with malloc at earlier stage


others
if you want to be able to change it during runtime you need to declare it dynamically using malloc and make it larger using realloc

the justification of realloc is that it s faster than 2nd malloc manual copy free

as we can see copying manually with memcpy is always slower than realloc because in this scenario malloc is guaranteed to allocate new memory and you re forced to copy the data in every allocation which shows us that realloc is indeed reusing the same address and enlarging the block size in some cases

malloc often gives you more memory that you ask and stores the actual value in a special location that realloc can access at a later time

i mean i think realloc is way smarter so why do we even need malloc

i know that realloc would be much easier to use but i am trying to do this only using malloc

since i don t know how many words are in a document i m using malloc to assign a certain amount of memory to the array holding all the words at first then using realloc to make it bigger if i ve filled that up

but if it works with large datasets the users will notice that using the malloc -only program slows down other programs much more than the realloc -using program with the same data


free calloc memory
in this context free store is different and incompatible with heap because the new delete free store library is simpler and quicker than the malloc free realloc calloc heap library and thus provides huge memory usage gains to the c++ embedded programmer in a context where you have only 512 bytes of ram

that s why realloc can temporarily require more memory than a malloc free pair

if you want to instrument libc s malloc calloc realloc things are even simpler - just wrap them in your allocator functions

in the case of overflow a free malloc pair costs less than realloc because of its internal hidden memcpy

dynamic memory management on an small embedded system is tricky to begin with but realloc is no more complicated than a free and malloc of course that s not what it does

in c you would use malloc to get memory realloc to get more memory and free to release memory

malloc free is harder because thereâ s also calloc and realloc

you will have to initially use malloc and then use realloc to allocate more memory on each step

a malloc free pair can be better than a realloc if you don t need to keep around the original memory

a realloc can occur significantly faster than a malloc memcpy and free

if you work with data that doesn t need construction destruction and requires reallocations a large array of ints then i believe malloc free is a good choice as it gives you realloc which is way faster than new-memcpy-delete it is on my linux box but i guess this may be platform dependent

i m not saying that realloc is worse than implementing realloc using a malloc free


old pointers new
if new is greater than old malloc additional pointers on the end of the array instead of trying to realloc them

realloc is worse than malloc in that you will need to have the old and new pointers valid during the realloc

you could have some initial guess for maxsize 8 and grow when needed your data perhaps by using realloc or just by malloc -ing a bigger new chunk copying the older chunk inside then free -ing that older chunk


innodb	myisam---------------------------------------------------

longer primary practice
innodb is affected by the primary key much more than myisam and it could make a noticeable difference

myisam supports longer rows than innodb does

one thing is that if your inserts are not in the order of increasing primary keys innodb can take a bit longer than myisam

so that means that in practice an innodb write will take 3 times longer than a myisam write


others
if you use a where clause though it changes the execution pattern to use indexes so in general innodb will be slower than myisam on full unrestricted counts where as the performance matches up on restricted counts

innodb tables are about 4x bigger than their myisam counterparts

your table sounds fairly large so i doubt it s being held entirely in memory but it sounds like innodb handles indexes better than myisam anyway plus since you re being so specific it may be caching the result of the query

there are other optimizations available but general rule is that innodb will be quicker than myisam is even with table growth

myisam table locking so innodb can handle more concurrent requests

innodb is more strict in data integrity while myisam is loose

while on antiquated hardware myisam was a necessity on modern hardware innodb actually performs better

myisam is faster for certain queries and supports fulltext and spatial indexes while innodb is transactional and more concurrent

myisam is faster in data warehousing situations such as full table scan reporting etc.. but innodb can actually be faster in many cases with normal oltp queries

therefore accessing myisam consumes less resources than innodb

innodb uses row level locking while myisam can only use table level locking that is why innodb has crash revovery is better than myisam

am i right that innodb is better for frequent concurrent updates and inserts than myisam

innodb is more resistant to table corruption than myisam

if that s true then you might not need all the transactional safety provided by the innodb storage engine and you might be able to get away with switching to myisam which is considerably more efficient on aggregate queries

innodb is more reliable than myisam

innodb delivered 4.6x higher throughput than myisam while achieving

generally you can have as good performance for reading as in myisam in innodb tables - you just can use count without where clause and you always should have a suitable index for where clauses as in innodb table scan will be slower than in myisam

myisam has historically been viewed as faster than innodb but for recent versions of innodb that is true for a much much smaller set of use cases

innodb is more scalable and myisam doesn t support any of the properties of acid

while the myisam type takes around 10mb average of 15b for each row the innodb type takes more than 30mb average of 44b

i don t want to use myisam because innodb is more advanced

myisam might be quicker in this instance but when you have 100 concurrent connections all reading and modifying this table at the same time you ll find a well-tuned innodb will win and myisam will choke on table locks

not sure why people think myisam is more performant than innodb - it s a conundrum wrapped in an enigma

plus you have to make your tables myisam which is generally less suitable than innodb

if there are more than one innodb tables that need a composite auto_incrementing primary key add an extra primary key to the myisam table

myisam tables have smaller footprints than innodb ones myth

innodb has more overhead but uses row-level locking so that reads and writes can happen concurrently without the problems that myisam s table locking incurs

innodb is much much stricter than myisam

myisam uses less memory than innodb and the actual data files are often quite a bit larger for innodb

innodb is also being developed more than myisam

myisam is still widely used in web applications as it has traditionally been perceived as faster than innodb in situations where most db access is reads

3 mysqlhotcopy inly works on myisam tables and in most applications you are better off with innodb

i ve figure out that even though myisam has locking contention it s still faster than innodb in most scenarios because of the rapid lock acquisition scheme it uses

innodb was faster when data was present already and generally performed better except for hdd-space - myisam is smaller on disk

innodb is usually much better than myisam at tables being available while insert update and delete are happening because innodb uses row level locking for updates whereas myisam uses table level locking

innodb implements mvcc multi-versioning concurrency control so locking is much more complex than with myisam

in innodb the count s when where group by or join is not used execute slower than in myisam because the row count is not stored internally

most dont bother to close wampserver down cleanly and therefore innodb can get corrupted more easily than myisam

during my tests of innodb v myisam i found that when i did resolve any contention issues the innodb model was 40 slower than myisam

you will need about six times less disk space to store and memory to process your dataset compared to innodb or about 2-3 times less than archived myisam

for an oltp type system innodb is usually more sensible than myisam did you check the contention before trying a different engine

if your database has a large innodb buffer pool and a small key buffer then innodb performance is going to be better than myisam performance especially for large tables

out of experience i m involved to a project that uses huge amount of data using mysql and we mostly prefer myisam for data that can be generated it allows to achieve much higher performance losing transactions but generally speaking myisam is faster but innodb is more reliable

newer versions of mysql 5.5+ have extended innodb to support all the features that were previously only available on myisam such as fulltext and geospatial indexing and innodb performance is usually considerably better than myisam when configured properly

by the way the reason this happened is because you are likely using myisam instead of innodb - it is a good idea to switch to innodb as innodb tables are less likely to crash

innodb is harder to tune since it has more knobs but a properly tuned innodb system can often have higher throughput than myisam due to better locking and better i o patterns

there are several q a for why is innodb much slower than myisam but i could not find any topic for the opposite

a last suggestion is to convert your db from myisam to innodb but i think this requires some investigation because it not always the case that innodb is faster

if your db storage engine is not wisely chosen like myisam instead of innodb you ll lose more performance than you might win with avoiding sessions

myisam is more prone to locking problems than innodb i believe

only drawback is that innodb need more server resources than myisam so if you have proper server resources then you should use innodb

even this blog from 2007 shows benchmark results that innodb is on par with or faster than myisam under most workloads

there is a difference between the different storage engines though myisam is faster for a lot of select innodb is faster for a lot of insert update because it uses row locking instead of table locking and the way it handles indexes

innodb has better performance than myisam though innodb needs more attention to tuning the configuration innodb supports atomic changes transactions foreign keys and innodb is much more resistant to corrupting data in a crash

innodb has a higher resource consumption rates then myisam so keep that in mind

myisam used to be faster years ago but if you use any reasonably current version of innodb then innodb is faster for most workloads

innodb is more concurrent than myisam since it provides row-level locking

select queries in myisam runs 2x faster then in innodb but the updates and insert queries are much slower in myisam

myisam is also considered a good read performer however my benchmarks show me that innodb indexes are faster

first question is it normal that innodb is much slower 7x slower than myisam for such usage

as you know myisam table sizes are about three or more times smaller than same innodb tables

mind that i ve seen weird behavior from myisam tables -- innodb tables are more consistent

myisam tables are generally more compact in size on disk when compared to innodb tables

innodb doesnt read number of rows from stored cached value like myisam does if column is not null cause innodb is more optimized for writing than reading opposing to myisam

this also affects how it is stored which leads to myisam being slower than innodb on insert due to myisam requiring a full index re-write on every insertion

anyone who thinks myisam is faster is either not tuning innodb correctly or has such small data that who cares

in this area i think innodb s change buffer does a better job than myisam s do it now

innodb -- more effecient than myisam because of the way the primary key is clustered with the data in innodb

it is possible that the config of your innodb engine is more efficient for your searches than the way you have myisam set up

to our suprise innodb took hours more than myisam

i heard correct me if i am wrong that innodb is better for tables that will be updated a lot because of row locking opposed to myisam s table locking

innodb supports better locking semantics so if there will be occasional or frequent writes or if you want better data integrity i d suggest starting there and then benchmarking myisam later if you can t hit your performance targets

to answer the real question why is myisam slower than innodb i can t give an authoritative answer

nothing is 100 safe but innodb properly used is a lot safer than myisam against data loss and corruption

innodb performance has been improved to the point where it is hard to come up with a benchmark that says myisam is faster

innodb provides more complex keys structure than myisam foreign keys and regenerating keys is really slow in innodb

but innodb has improved dramatically in the past few years and in most cases today innodb performs faster than myisam

if you find that innodb is much slower for inserts updates bear in mind that it offers a much better level of durability - if you tune it for approximately the same durability as myisam then you ll see good performance hopefully

the lone exception is myisam which is an older mysql storage engine which does not support transactions is more prone to corruption and generally tends to perform worse than innodb

innodb does support transactions and referential integrity but the trade-off is that it is a bit slower than myisam


optimization storage level
3 a first of all if you haven t done yet change the storage engine to innodb which has row level locking and in newer versions of mysql has more optimization than myisam has

although 4m isn t that many rows with contention and depending on your structure and database engine it may take a while i think myisam alters take longer than innodb because myisam requires whole table locks and handles concurrency less well


newer older transaction
innodb is relatively newer than myisam and is transaction safe

innodb is newer while myisam is older


strict efficient integrity
there are some situations when myisam is infinitely more efficient than innodb when manipulating large data dumps offline because of table lock

innodb is more strict in data integrity while myisam is not as


default better values
tuning innodb which is the better engine requires adjusting different values than myisam which is often the fast-but-unsafe default

there may be some exotic corner cases where myisam performs marginally better for certain workloads table-scans or high-volume insert-only work but the default choice should be innodb unless you can prove you have a case that myisam does better


better solution bulletproof
a better solution is not to use myisam for tables where the data is constantly changing - innodb is much more bulletproof and as paul correctly points out you can use transactions on innodb tables but not on myisam

the engine is myisam i ve heard people recommend switching to innodb but many others said myisam is faster with large amounts of data in terms of counting and innodb better for safe transactions


table-level common big
it s also worth mentioning that innodb supports row-level locking while myisam only supports table-level locking - which is to say that for many common situations innodb can be dramatically faster due to more queries executing in parallel

innodb can be slower at searches because it doesn t offer full text search like myisam but that isn t a big problem when you compare it to table-level locking of myisam


differences hanky comment
google myisam vs innodb to find out more about the differences

the comment of hanky that linked to myisam versus innodb tells you more about the differences


default gurus at-least
and now i have learned that innodb uses more memory at-least while reading than myisam engine so i am trying to change the default engine of mysql to use myisam

you should use innodb in such scenarios and most mysql gurus recommend using innodb by default anyway because it s considered more generally reliable than myisam despite being slower under some use cases


table stuff records
if you have so many records in the table then the first thing is to change the table engine to innodb if its not innodb because for large number of records innodb is much faster as it caches the table data while on the contrary myisam engine only caches the indexes so each time it has to do a full table scan from disk if the data required cannot be fetched from index

put another way let s say i start with a new innodb table and insert 20 gb of data assuming that 20 gb incorporates all the excess innodb stuff i realize data stored in innodb is larger than myisam then i delete all data then i insert 10 gb of data


better acid integrity
therefore innodb can handle higher levels of concurrency better than myisam

i currently have myisam and i would like to stay with it because it had far better performance than innodb in my case but i heard that innodb has acid transactions

since you don t do updates i think myisam would be better than innodb in this scenario

but when myisam is really better than innodb

innodb is more complex while myisam is simpler

finally even if somehow you could manage myisam to perform better than innodb that doesn t mean innodb is inadecuate at all

innodb scales better than myisam

analytics -- when you can scan via the clustered pk you get better performance with innodb than with myisam which has to bounce back and forth between the separate index and the data

often myisam is fine in certain other cases innodb is better

sometimes i got asked on some interviews what benefits does innodb have against myisam and when myisam is better than innodb

you can also try using innodb since it s said is better than myisam handling bulk inserts with data already on it

as well i used innodb engine but myisam is better if most of the queries are select and you are not going to do many writes

but in certain scenarios myisam works better than innodb

if you use insert and update high performance uses innodb over myisam is better

also i can t see your table engine but myisam is better for full text searching rather than innodb

as for reliability i think that postgresql is more reliable especially when compared to mysql using myisam - innodb is a lot better here

additionally i ve changed the db engine from myisam to innodb to have better foreign key support

someone just told me that innodb is much better than myisam

i have heard that myisam performs better than innodb on read-oriented tables

it is said that if you have a mostly read based application you should use myisam as it is better than innodb

since myisam is better on selecting while innodb is better on writing

then i thought about innodb but then i read that myisam is better with many write operations

1 in mysql engines myisam is better or innodb

in many discussions and even in mysql documents it has been mentioned that in case of updates innodb performs much better than myisam

innodb would be a better choice than myisam for a high-write table

myisam locks the entire table while innodb do a better handling of rows being changed

almost always innodb is a better choice than myisam

innodb is a safer acid compliant engine with some integrity features that myisam lacks

myisam is better than innodb when you don t need those advanced features and storage speed is more important than other concerns

so i guess myisam would be better suited than innodb

mostly innodb is better choice than a myisam

firstly i switched from innodb to myisam which is better designed for mysql spatial extensions

you can also use compression on the tables to keep them smaller but innodb is vastly better than myisam at data integrity

so for such an application is it will innodb be a better choice over myisam

as a sub-question do you think innodb would be a better choice of engine here than myisam

innodb when tuned well performs better than myisam

oracle has kept improving innodb by so much that they declare that it is better than myisam in virtually all situations

in fact oracle is so sure that innodb is better that they removed myisam from 8.0

you can change your database to myisam -- i m guessing you re only reading from the tables in the database otherwise if you have read write transactions innodb is the better choice

myisam delivers better read performance compared to innodb at the cost of being less acid compliant

myisam is more susceptible to data corruption than innodb and usually innodb performs better because it caches both data and indexes

most of the literature that says myisam is better faster whatever then innodb is old literature

generally innodb is much better for preserving your data integrity so stick with it and do not go back to myisam there is also a matter of what each engine is best fore but unless you give us more details there is no point in dwelling on that

this is one way in which innodb is sometimes better than myisam

innodb is a better choice as myisam is really old engine and would fade away in near future

innodb has better crash recovery while myisam is poor at recovering

innodb has better crash recovery while myisam is poor at recovering data integrity at system crashes

you insert in there but never select from there as far as i know today myisam is better than innodb in this case

myisam is better for high read volumes innodb for high update volumes due to table vs row locking

myisam has some problems with many recordings and other bugs and innodb is now better


faster slower table
innodb is often slower than myisam being a transactional db engine with acid properties

myisam is slightly faster than innodb and implements the fulltext index which is quite useful for integrating search capabilities

innodb is slower than myisam for most uses but can perform faster in certain conditions due to a better locking mechanism

if you are not using transactions while storing or updating tables switch table type to myisam its quite faster than innodb with much less overhead

however innodb tends to be slower as myisam

myisam is much faster for reads but since it locks the whole table for writes this is where overall throughput drops compared with innodb

you are right because myisam is really faster than innodb

myisam is faster than innodb for reads myth

myisam will be quicker definitely because it s losing the acid-compliance that is inherent in innodb

use myisam usually much faster than innodb if your data base isnt transaction oriented

now the response i got from my boss is that i need to prove that innodb will run faster than myisam

after testing it seems that myisam is faster than innodb when using when there is no where clause

at the beginning the insert performance of innodb is almost 50 times slower than myisam and tokudb is 40 times slower than myisam

also table type of myisam will import faster depends on if you need transactional support innodb

i am not sure if this is no longer true myisam is faster than innodb for reads

the trope about myisam being faster than innodb is a holdover from code that was current in the mid-2000 s

and innodb indexes are even slower to rewrite than myisam

myisam is faster but does not support the use of transactions like innodb does

in general is myisam faster than innodb

innodb is transactional so inserts will generally be slower than myisam

innodb shouldn t be much slower than myisam

note however that for high traffic websites we do modify the joomla core and we also switch the tables from innodb to myisam regardless what others might think here myisam is much faster than innodb

beststat is innodb so i have row-level locking and consindering i do a lot of inserts-updates it should be faster than myisam

myisam inserts are going to be faster than innodb so if you re logging data and retrieving it later that will be a win

we know that myisam is faster than innodb when we don t have many concurrent updates inserts

memory and myisam would be faster when inserting updating but if you are experiencing frequent dead-locks then innodb would be the way to go

myisam is the perfect choice since the database is almost only used for reading and myisam is significantly faster that innodb

i know innodb tends to be a bit slower than myisam on counting but this is far too long

in a thread i came to know that myisam is faster for reads innodb is faster for writes

innodb table is a bit slower than myisam tables but i don t think it is a major problem as you told you are using drupal system is that a kind of mult-sites like a word-press system

ok there are some cases where myisam is faster than innodb but rarely enough that it s worth putting up with the lack of acid-compliance

also mysql version starting from 5.5 - innodb performs faster than myisam

myisam is faster when the query is simple but it s much slower in a high concurrent environment as its table level lock comparing to innodb s row level lock

the script was tested using myisam and it indexes products relatively fast much much faster than innodb

i was told that innodb had worse write performance than that of myisam

oh and just incase you were thinking innodb is slower than myisam - the myisam implementation i tested was twice as slow in all counts

innodb is actually faster than myisam in quite a few cases so it depends on what your application s mix of selects updates concurrent queries indexes buffer configuration etc

myisam is not faster than innodb anymore for most types of queries

some people have said that for reads myisam is faster but recent improvements in innodb have either alleviated or eradicated this difference

in general it seems as though the concensus is to primarily use innodb but there are still some areas in which myisam is much faster than innodb

innodb not only has the advantages you list but it is also faster than myisam in many benchmarks

while myisam can be faster for some queries innodb is usually quicker if properly tuned

please notice that counting with where is not slower with innodb than it would be with myisam

in my opinion myisam use to be faster than innodb now they are pretty much the same in speed

i considered changing them to innodb to make the database 100 the same but then read the myisam is faster

edited to add myisam is faster than innodb because it is simpler

in some benchmarks i see that myisam is faster than innodb but seems i have a little improvement

also innodb is slower than myisam unless myisam is blocking for a huge select

generally speaking innodb is slower than myisam as innodb is atomic while myisam is not

innodb tables are even slower than myisam tables for inserts and the delayed key write option is not available

by the way i use mysql 5.1.62 and the myisam tables but i also tested innodb which was even slower

i heard myisam is faster but others say innodb can be fast also but it takes abit more to optimize it

database performance of the innodb is not necessary faster than the myisam engine

it is a massive over simplification in some cases and plain wrong in others to say we know that myisam is faster than innodb

myisam is almost 4 time faster than innodb which is not acceptable in the environment we are working as i mentioned earlier that every second is worth many dollers for us

have you considered changing to innodb - it has much better concurrency support and in some contexts will run faster than myisam

myisam can be faster than innodb because it has a simpler design

speed does matter here myisam is still slightly faster than innodb especially for reads

i know innodb is heavier than myisam but just how much more

why is innodb so much slower than myisam in my case

innodb seems slightly faster than myisam but this is really marginal

in terms of pure speed it is not always the case that myisam is faster than innodb but in my experience it tends to be faster for pure read working environments by a factor of about 2.0-2.5 times

anyway if you don t need to have foreign keys checks myisam would be faster than innodb

myisam table is much faster than innodb but no rollback is possible

myisam has proved to be faster than innodb for me

if there are many modifications of the data it s said that innodb works faster because it uses row locking instead of table locking like myisam

myisam is often faster than innodb but isn t safe to use in a production environment for critical data

myisam is often faster than innodb in terms of raw performance mostly because it is not acid

innodb is slower than myisam but in which cases

innodb is slower for read only databases because it has features acid compliant row level locking that myisam leaves out

edit for the read-performance this link shows that innodb often is actually not slower than myisam

and it s rarely faster than innodb since innodb uses row locks and mvcc as opposed to myisam s full-table locks

myisam for reads may well be faster than innodb

yes it is an old wives tale that myisam is faster than innodb

also note that some mysql engines are faster than others for example myisam may run faster than innodb at expense of the lack of real foreign keys

with innodb there is less time lost from table locking while myisam is faster in table readings

i have been told innodb is faster on executing writes but slower than myisam doing reads i cannot back this up and could not find any article that analyses this i do however have the guy that told me this in high regard feel free to ignore this point or do your own research

2 - i have read about myisam vs innodb the conclusion for me was that myisam is faster when it comes to read-only whereas innodb is designed for tables that get updated or inserts more frequently

after all innodb shouldn t be slower than myisam when using count + where but that s exactly what is happening here

myisam generally performs faster because it lacks certain functions innodb has such as rollback... but it has only table locking


quicker boost composite
this is a huge performance boost look like myisam is much more quicker for fulltext in mysql than innodb

innodb handles inserts with composite primary keys quicker than myisam


space disk cheap
it s true there are some cases where myisam can use less disk space but disk space is cheap and i d much rather get the benefits of innodb

myisam also tends to store data in less space than innodb

myisam is more space friendly than innodb you can start with that one

innodb consumes more disk space than myisam -- typically 2x-3x


performance closer model
their conclusion innodb has 30 higher performance than myisam on average

this would help myisam come closer to innodb s model and performance but would add complexity to your code

you can find more information by amazon here link an alexa user with a user in your system


coalesce	nvl---------------------------------------------------

others
2 however coalesce requires all arguments to be of the same data type thus being stricter than nvl which will first attempt an implicit conversion

coalesce does the same thing here as nvl but is more portable

nvl versus coalesce oracle is much pickier about reserved words

coalesce is more efficient than nvl as it only evaluates the second argument if the first is null whereas nvl evaluates both arguments every time

coalesce is more cross-compatible than isnull or nvl it works on mssql oracle mysql derby et al.


quicker simpler first
you could also use nvl but that is a legacy function and coalesce is quicker since it stops at the first non-null

the coalesce function is used here because it is more portable than nvl or ifnull

the ansi standard function coalesce is simpler than using nvl and decode which should be obsoleted anyway


wicket	stripes---------------------------------------------------

others
and beware that in this area there are many much more alternatives or fragmentation than in .net some more oriented to the mvc pattern struts struts2 stripes spring mvc some more component-based jsf tapestry wicket and some others gwt


public	protected---------------------------------------------------

others
i think that as a commenter suggested reflection is the way to go - you can get more than the public ie protected variables but still apparently can t get private ones

doesn t work either due to the public scope being less restrictive than the overall property scope of protected and moreover not of the same scoping level as defined on the base class s abstract property declaration

note that this will work when the variable is public but it is best to limit the scope as much as you can so protected is more sutable here

from this point of view if a class has members which don t need to be protected for example a boolean which its corresponding get set functions can be freely changed by the user is better to put that attributes as public and remove the get set functions more or less these are the bjarne stroustrup words

reason i once heard that protected is better for hibernate performance but all i can find on the web is hibernate can access public private and protected accessor methods as well as public private and protected fields directly

what is the true rationale behind all the private and protected stuff when we can just make our life as a programmer easier by using public for everything

from a software engineering point of view as soon as you make a function protected you expose it to other users of course much more limited than public exposure but still much more exposed than private and you create expectation about some stability of the api

if you overload it you must also define it as protected or define it as public which is weaker

public is higher than protected so there s no problem

and you really limit yourself by using public most novice coders look at protected as being more limited

in my regex replace modifier with public private protected replace returntype with the return type and replace methodname with the method name.

so only letting what are used for other classes and objects nothing more than that public for those where other classes would use too protected for those limit only for extending classes

the solutions using a public constructor are fine too but as the constructor cannot be called directly on thr interface i think protected is better

this approach seems more complicated and possibly less clear than inheriting protected and then using into public the base class members your child class actually needs to expose

protected functions maintain a weaker invariant than the public one before and after each call


package accessible control
if you don t need it to be public it s often safer not to due to getter setter allowing better control over what values can be assigned then you should declare if protected or private

change it to public to make it more accessible or perhaps better protected to make it less accessible than public but more than private read more about that here

since package protected is less accessible than public the code is reducing the accessibility of the foo method

otherwise there is still the possibility to change a public access to a protected or package private access which will be much more restrictive than public

using default no protected private public is even worse as it allows classes in the same package or subclasses to access the logger

for your first problem make sure that both the classes are in the same package and the members are declared either public not recommended or protected better or don t specify any access specifier which is a bit more restrictive than protected


closer method programming
that means private is better than protected protected is better than public etc ..

protected is more restrictive than public

so a protected is more restrictive than public and private is more restrictive than protected

secondly if you want the superclass variables to be accessible by your subclassing it s better to use protected than public

protected is closer to public than private

it s not perfect but i guess that a protected method that does not check parameters is better than a public method that does not do it

also using private and protected instead of public is more about good programming design than security and i recommend you read about it as well as polymorphism and inheritance

furthermore protected is actually closer to public than to private


constructor sense class
i did not make any changes more than change protected to public but i add another class in a new package to print the rules by these following codes

the theory is that someone extending your class with protected access knows more about what they are doing than someone who is merely using it with public access

many developers have established a coding convention instead and used public for those cases where protected may have made more sense

oh i see you need a constructor that has more access than protected but less than public

therefore the only types that should have access to a constructor are its derived types and hence protected makes much more sense than public

there ll be no functional difference between the constructor being public or being protected but making it protected gives a clearer indication of the intended use


trac	mantis---------------------------------------------------

others
i think you ll find that your team will like either trac or redmine more than bugzilla or mantis


hmac	pbkdf2---------------------------------------------------

others
use either bcrypt on its own or pbkdf2 in combination with your sha-512 although sha-1 hmac is more than enough

pbkdf2 also uses a more complex construction in particular hmac over direct digest to make recovering the input password from an output value more difficult

an hmac is a better way of adding your salt and pbkdf2 is based on hmac - see below for more detail on pbkdf2 - there s a good discussion at when is it safe to use a broken hash function

in django for example passwords are hash with pbkdf2 or bcrypt but session hash use a less complex hmac and no random salt


tunnel	vpn---------------------------------------------------

others
on the other hand the secure tunnel created in a vpn is far more secure than remote desktop

and between we are just looking to send and receive data over tunnel there is nothing more or need to control computer on the network all we need is to route data through corporate firewall and should support multiple vpn servers such as cisco microsoft etc

if you absolutely must connect to a database hosted on the cellular network end i would suggest you try setting up a vpn openvpn is a good product available on many platforms or using a reverse tunnel it s simpler but you will need to setup the reverse tunnel everytime you want to access remote database


jxtable	jtable---------------------------------------------------

others
i have a jtable or a jxtable to be more precise with 3 sections of grouped columns i want to divide

use swing-x components there is a jxtable which is more powerful than jtable

note i know the jxtable variant of jtable has some more options for filtering and highlighting rows but i did not find a solution yet.

also is jxtable better than jtable for such an application


wxpython	pyqt---------------------------------------------------

others
also there s pyqt for gui and wxpython mentioned earlier

two words of warning against wxpython it is not possible to install it via the popular fink package manager on mac os x currently which makes it far less portable than pyqt and tkinter


looks framework attractive
at least they are much easier to intall even pyqt is hard to code for me and wxpython is less attractive when it comes to looks

wxpython is probably easier than pyqt or tkinter i don t want to start a framework war


tapestry	wicket---------------------------------------------------

others
in my opinion this is a more elegant solution than jsf and i think tapestry s ioc container makes it more powerful than wicket

wicket s goal is to support static typing to the fullest extent whereas tapestry is more about saving lines of code


bazaar	git---------------------------------------------------

others
bazaar is easier to extend in an api way git is easier to extend in a unix way pipes

note most recently i have been using bazaar and hg with fully powerful regexps so may be looking for stuff more powerful than git provides

it works fine and fits all my needs but recently i found that git works better than bazaar so i decided to use it but i face a problem with git usability because most git s gui not user friendly as bazaar explorer so i want your advice based on a practical experience which best git s gui user friendly or which one is most similar to bazaar explorer

in git you can do the same with playing around in the index staging area but bazaar has a better ui for it

bazaar is imho easier to learn than git

bazaar is a distributed version tool just like git but is imo simpler to setup and use

bazaar is more discoverable if you are given the tool wo any documentation any semi-competent user will be able to use bazaar that s not so true with git


control systems hg
some version control systems bazaar hg git make this easier than others but it s possible on most

this type of flexibility is what draws me to bazaar despite the fact that git is wildly more popular and faster

but distributed version control systems like git mercurial and bazaar are much better suited for your type of environment than subversion


stuff perforce balling
an incredibly rough eye balling of the numbers they posted showed bazaar to be 2-4x slower than either git or mercurial in the use cases tested

you may also want to take a look at why git is better than x a site that attempts to convince you of the superiority of git over mercurial bazaar subversion and perforce

a lot of articles about bazaar will tell you it is a lot slower than git or mercurial

mercurial is significantly faster than bazaar it s slower than git though by a much smaller difference

subversion git mercurial or bazaar would be better choices

i hear all this stuff about bazaar being slower than git


restrict	shared---------------------------------------------------

others
the code is riddled with classes which contain nothing more than public shared attributes variables and methods functions the result of which restrict the application from opening more than one project at a time

this allows a file shared to offer more restrict access to some files than if the same user were attempt to access them locally


post	put---------------------------------------------------

others
where 404 may be suitable for get and put update but less suitable for post inserts

the client post scores and fetches highscore lists from the server and everything seemed to be working perfectly we had been testing it for a month with no problems and the code is really simple with not much more than a put get

you could manage more than get or post like put delete...

i m very sorry for the long question but i thought instead of dividing the question into several post it is more convenient if they are put into one place

if noop a put may make more sense than a post which would imply creating a second connection

i think you forgot to put closing braces better you post your code

post is usually intended for creating content put is more modifications

i resorted to split the two in swagger list-without-search as get and list+search as post just to put the page in the swagger documentation also if the latter actually works also as get

ironjs has undergone a radical rewrite since my first post so i have put notices on those post directing to newer updates

put is used for updating a record and so unless you are specifically storing the fact that a user is not following another user post would be more correct

without wanting to self-promote i ve also put together a blog post that goes into more detail on the aforementioned answer that should be of some use

i put the prior code in this post to make it easier for you to visualize it

this method also allows you to put the url within the action parameter of the form and uses post which is more secured for transferring password information

if you want to follow the spec then put says that the body is a representation of the url you put to while post is more general purpose

class cplayer has a lot more fields than i put here but they are not relevant to this post

i think to safely use put on a public website requires even more effort than using post and is less commonly done due to potential security issues

i have a website with html css js php mysql i have jquery code i put it for the post i mean i change the css property and animation for the post read more date..... on hover mouse the problem is the code work only in the first post if i create a new post it will work only in this latest post and when i hover on an other post the code work in the first code thanx in advance and excuse me for my english am not good

put does not mean update any more than post means insert

what about the question how many items to put on the screen you can give a solution like this for each post give fixed x height and if it requires more space put read more link on the bottom of the post which will reveal missing part when user clicks

anyway http 405 is telling you that your backend does not support the put method and probably it s expecting a post method with the x-http-method-override put http header since post is more standard method in rest than put

get and post are relatively common put is less common so may not be covered in your server implementation

at first i thought i need to put an id to the radio buttons but later when i went through other post i got more and more confused

but that post is currently put on hold as my post question is more technically-oriented rather than just a general-purpose question

you got at least put and delete although they are used much less frequent than get and post as in hardly ever

also you can send a text only to given client determined by the url it can be post but put looks nicer

if the model being presented to the user was of a file system having the user supply the resource name makes a huge amount of sense and put becomes the main creation operation and post becomes delegated to less common things like making an empty directory and so on

q1.i know that post is better than put for name-value pair parameters as the get exposes it in url and post doesn t

i basically know zilch of java but i m hoping someone can help me put something into that .parse function that would get me post that have dateupdated newer than 5 days


server method multiple
both get post user can put any thing in it and you must filter any input that user make it in your form example the value in textfiled sent to server by post method and that don t make it safer than get method the difference between them that the textfiled value doesn t visible in url

put seems like socket to socket connection such as telnet mail server so using post may provide more of an underlying framework to uploading multiple files in a single batch as you already have the boundaries built in my the post method


file simpler multipart
side note it looks like you re using the post form of file upload which as the docs say is considerably more complex than put

to receive a file in your api i would use a put request simpler than post multipart and fetch the data from the stream php input

put requests are much simpler than a file upload using post requests and they look something like this

put to the api a message describing the outcome of the game post is acceptable put is better for idempotency

http put isn t inherently any more secure than http post if you re allowing the uploaded files to be exceuted on your server

put is designed for file uploads moreso than post which requires doing a multipart upload but then it comes down to what your server can do as to which is more convenient for you to implement

on the php docs link above they say a put request is much simpler than a post request when uploading file along with this advantage what other advantages disadvanatges do the put has got compared to the post

to send binary data put will be faster than post based on the same logic and because post will use multipart form-data encoding headers but browser support is more limited for put requests


show individual word
i d like to limit the content that is shown to a certain number of characters and then put a read more link to go to the show page for that individual blog post

after few word i put a read more button when i click read more it s show full message it s ok but it s show all my post s full message


new resource better
put is preferred for database updates and post to create new entities so post is better on this case

more importantly in this case i think post is more appropriate than put

you d probably be better off in this case to put a currenttextid on your post table to avoid having to figure out which revision is current an alternative would be a flag on revision but i think a currenttextid on the post will give you easier queries

i think that in that case the put verb is more appropriate because post really means i want to create something new

side note if you are attempting to create a new customer you may want to use post instead as it may be considered more restful as put s are generally for updating an existing resource but this is up to you

post is better but if you want it to be truly restful you should ensure that the uri uniquely identifies the resource and use put

typically you would not allow a http client to determine the uri of a new resource so a post to blog would be safer than a put to blog article-uri although http does cater for appropriate responses should the server be unable to honour the intended uri

true fifo message ordering longer delays and so on but sadly smaller message sizes. push queue allow you to set up push subscribers which then receive an http post any time a new message is put onto the queue

i decide to put the gps location recording answer into a new post to make things cleaner

post is also more commonly used for partial updates as put generally implies sending a full new representation of the resource

i would really like to put some place holders in the text for images - you know to make the blog post look better some interspersed images that relate to the content

while this means that a post can create a new resource and is certainly the best way to do so when it is the server that will give that new resource its uri with put being the more appropriate method when the client dictates the new uri it is can also be used for cases that delete objects though again if it s a deletion of a single resource identifiable by a uri then delete is far more appropriate both create and delete objects change multiple objects it can mean that your kitchen light turns on but that the response is the same whether that worked or failed because the communication from the webserver to the kitchen light doesn t allow for feedback about success


secure data appropriate
bowler is pretty much scalatra + scalate with some enforcing nudging of the developer towards good restful practices such as proper use of content-type and accept http headers for responding and emitting html and json and dealing with get post delete and put in appropriate ways and making bad uses of get and delete harder

wrap your update button in a and make it post to your backend in fact put would be more appropriate here as you are updating existing data

words like arbitrary processing and neither not safe make post sounds less secure than put when there is a choice

data should be in post or get.if you dont put your data in your form then you will have to use get which is less secure than post


nhibernate	bltoolkit---------------------------------------------------

others
update for our purposes bltoolkit ended up being a better solution than nhibernate


gunicorn	uwsgi---------------------------------------------------

production change heroku
as other already suggested nginx + gunicorn or better nginx + uwsgi are better options than apache + mod_python to serve your django app

according to many benchmarks uwsgi seems to provides better performance than gunicorn and if the performance doesn t change significantly you ll be able to focus your investigation on nginx or ec2 configurations

i ve been using uwsgi in production on heroku for over a year and it seems to handle everything a lot better than gunicorn


others
i always used uwsgi but realized that gunicorn is easier for simple projects like mine

i sure would like to use uwsgi as it is an ambitious project but at the end of the day i am a developer and not a sys admin and gunicorn is much easier to just get working in the common use cases


gedit	sublimetext---------------------------------------------------

others
i have tried with sublimetext 2 and it work very very good better than gedit p


xjc	maven-jaxb2-plugin---------------------------------------------------

others
however it may be that maven-jaxb2-plugin uses a newer version of xjc than you re using with enum


cfstring	nsstring---------------------------------------------------

others
cfstring has some slightly better functionality than nsstring but is a bit harder to use


background-image	background-color---------------------------------------------------

others
i understand that the background-color one doesn t require an http request and that the background-image takes more processing

a lot of answers comments are mentioning that the background-color rgba is faster and more efficient but that background-image is more compatibility friendly


concave	angle---------------------------------------------------

others
edit2 okay i just see that if the angle is bigger than 180â it s concave so i have to change the shape for be simple than a triangulation


corners total corner
if the total of the angle is less than 180â the triangle must be â œhyperbolicâ on a concave surface which might be the shape of our universe

you check that the polygon is not concave by simply checking for all angle being less than 180 degrees - any corners which has a angle of over 180 is concave and you need to break it at that corner


boxlayout	grouplayout---------------------------------------------------

components concrete example
as a concrete example this boxlayout example is better done using grouplayout illustrated here and here

some don t take too well to added components for example grouplayout while others do better such as boxlayout


others

operands	decrement---------------------------------------------------

others
i need to group the primes number partially to perform changes to frequency reducing the stages assuring the increment or numerator is greater than decrement or denominator to avoid the undersampling problem preferred small operands


tablet	hdpi---------------------------------------------------

others

512px xxhdpi pixel
owing to the fact that the screens density on the tablet is smaller android therefore uses the images in the mdpi folder for the tablet and the slightly bigger ones in the hdpi folder for the phone

in your case whats happening is that your galaxy tablet has a lower pixel density and android down-scales the image from a xxhdpi to whatever density the tablet has hdpi or xhdpi ....so it your image is a 512px image android would down-scale it to 341px for xhdpi or 256px for an hdpi device

each device has a density like hdpi ldpi and mdpi tablet have even more


atomic	compare-and-swap---------------------------------------------------

others
i don t need more than atomic read operation and atomic write operations i have no use for fetch-and-add compare-and-swap etc.


jscrollpane	jinternalframe---------------------------------------------------

others
i ve found that in my jtable which is in a jscrollpane nested in a jinternalframe there can be issues with scrolling and resizing when the jtable was larger than the jscrollpane


smaller height jlabel
specifically jscrollpane have height bigger than jinternalframe

my problem is this i don t want the jlabel or the jscrollpane to stretch to the size of the jinternalframe if the jlabel is smaller than the jinternalframe


uicontrol	uibutton---------------------------------------------------

others
i set the superclass as uicontrol instead of uibutton because i might want to change this to let the user drag the item to reveal a menu or something but i m pretty sure that uicontrol should be able to do everything uibutton can do and more

a solution i ve used is a simple subclass of uicontrol which allows more customization than subclassing uibutton and less hassle than nsattributedstring et al

instead of working around the 1 label and image you get in a uibutton it s cleaner to start from scratch with a uicontrol and create your tiles

sounds like you want to use some of the inherited uicontrol methods such as sendaction to forevent this offers even finer control than with uibutton


cprofile	timeit---------------------------------------------------

others
you should always use the timeit module for time trials it is far more accurate than cprofile here


centroid	threshold---------------------------------------------------

others
i want to know if there is way in matlab so that i can find number of points in each grid so that i can classify it as a dense cell or sparse cell.if the number of points in a grid is more than a threshold it can be said to be dense .i need to find distance between each point in a sparse grid and centroid of each cluster to find which point is the outlier.if min distances between a test object o in a sparse grid and cenroid of each cluster threshold value it is outlier.can you suggest a method to implement this in matlab

precision parameter if centroid amount of change is less than a threshold delta stop the algorithm


keyup	mousedown---------------------------------------------------

others
logic to handle enter + mouse click is placed on keydown and mousedown it could be moved to keyup and mouseup if makes more sense


wxpython	textctrl---------------------------------------------------

others
i have been working on a simple textctrl project to get more acquainted with wxpython and i have hit a small road block


jhat	jvisualvm---------------------------------------------------

others
another way to do the same thing is to use jvisualvm which is much more user friendly but also more memory consuming than jhat


nsstring	nsobject---------------------------------------------------

others
nsstring has a higher level it also inherited form nsobject const on it should have no effect in fact not the same meaning about the no effect on immutable object


redmine	trac---------------------------------------------------

multiple box projects
redmine handles multiple projects and sub-projects right out of the box and overall seems nicer than trac

redmine is an open source ruby on rails application that supports multiple projects much better than trac and seems to be much easier to administer


authors wound easier
i wound up going with redmine and it s way better than trac

redmine was written to be a better trac than trac

the authors of redmine are trying to create a better trac than trac

we found redmine to be a better than trac simply because it is easier to use


others
i understand redmine is more of a trac clone but retrospectiva seem to support agile methodologies via a nice plugin

we have previously used trac but have found redmine to be much more intuitive flexible and user-friendly

redmine handles multiple projects and sub projects far nicer than trac

for next projects i m going to try redmine seems more clean and hipe than trac

we ve recently switched from trac to redmine where i work and i think i like it a little more than trac and use the wiki functionality almost everyday

i d recommend redmine like the other posters as it is more complete than trac

redmine s installation process is not easy but trac installation became also more complex these days so manual database creation etc

redmine is definitely much more popular but trac is getting more popular in particular as 1.0 version is around the corner


ireport	subreports---------------------------------------------------

others
if your report is complicated and have many subreports and subdatasets its better to go this approach since ireport will make it quicker and easier for you to design and maintain later


configobj	configparser---------------------------------------------------

others
check out configobj its the slickest method i ve found so far and definitely more flexible than configparser


built-in easier
i ve heard that configobj is easier to work with than configparser

i have heard that configobj is easier to use than configparser even though it is not a built-in library


mongoose	mongojs---------------------------------------------------

others
i would like to use mongo js and mongoose in the same app.i require mongo js as i don t want write schema for a specific functionality of the app as it includes nested and complex data.i tried mongoose but that just makes it more difficult.with mongojs i could directly write mongodb queries and execute.whereas for other functionalities like validation and simple schema mongoose would be better so can i use both

in either case mongoose is going to add a tiny amount of overhead so it s likely to be technically slower than mongojs but not by any meaningful amount like it takes 5.1 seconds to insert 20k records vs 5.0 seconds


quicksort	shellsort---------------------------------------------------

others
if you use shellsort no extra memory is needed at all though shellsort will be much slower than quicksort


uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar---------------------------------------------------

others
the framespace for the uiviewcontroller becomes smaller because uinavigationcontroller manipulates the view by adding a uinavigationbar which is 44.0f in size

the ardalahmet solution is not the right one if you need different backgrounds for each uinavigationbar when you have more than one uinavigationcontroller such as in a uitabbar because it using uinavigationbar categories


redmine	bugzilla---------------------------------------------------

others
i think you ll find that your team will like either trac or redmine more than bugzilla or mantis


mailkit	imapx---------------------------------------------------

others
i m not familiar enough with imapx to make this more efficient but if you were to use mailkit for instance you could do this


revmob	marmalade---------------------------------------------------

others
this one is more promising than revmob because banner positioning and event callbacks appear to be possible but due to marmalade and cocos2d-x s gl conflicts this might turn out to be just as bad a solution as iwgameads


sqoop	hadoop---------------------------------------------------

others
also we see hadoop s sqoop is much faster than spark for this part but it writes to hdfs which will needs a lot of work to be converted to dataset for spark uses

can anyone give some details about oracle hadoop connectors will it perform better than sqoop

sqoop 1 is older fully functional and mature project supporting hadoop 0.20 1.x 0.23 and 2.0.x you can download the bits from here


uinavigationbar	uitabbarcontroller---------------------------------------------------

others
in specific i would like the uinavigationbar in the uitabbarcontroller s more view controller to be an instance of my class


atom-editor	sublimetext---------------------------------------------------

packages performance better
sublimetext has better performance than atom-editor

atom-editor is still missing a lot of packages that sublimetext supports so the question is will atom-editor catch up with sublimetext or become some better


others
again because atom-editor is still in the beta stage sublimetext has much more native plugin packages

plus copy as rtf for atom-editor has more recent updates than sublimehightlight for sublimetext

there s also the save-session plugin which makes atom-editor behave more like sublimetext the current state of each file is remembered across application instances

though similar in ui and ux sublimetext performs significantly better than atom-editor especially in heavy lifting like working with large files complex snr or plugins that do heavy processing on files buffers

why atom-editor uses more memory and takes more time to start as compare to sublimetext editor

atom-editor has better github support out of the box but sublimetext has a several git packages


dns	spf---------------------------------------------------

others
your spf record requires more than 10 dns lookups to process


openssl	cryptlib---------------------------------------------------

others
openssl is more similar to peter gutmann s cryptlib and gnu s gnutls


xlwings	xlsxwriter---------------------------------------------------

others
i know that xlsxwriter is way faster than xlwings and have functionality to add border but it is just a writer it can t update already existing spreadsheet


xdebug	xhprof---------------------------------------------------

others
thanks mikushi for the comment another possibility that i haven t used much is the the xhprof extension it also helps with profiling can generate callgraphs -- but is lighter than xdebug which mean you should be able to install it on a production server


eigenvalue	diagonal---------------------------------------------------

others
i don t know what you anticipate your matrix band structure to look like but if it is symmetric and either diagonal dominant off diagonal bands along each row and column are opposite sign of diagonal and their sum is less than the diagonal entry or positive definite no eigenvectors with an eigenvalue of 0. then cg and iccg should be useful

because is singular t can be constructed such that the last element on the diagonal or even more diagonal elements if the multiplicity of the eigenvalue is larger than one is zero


codeigniter	yii---------------------------------------------------

others
after some time of using codeigniter i found that using yii is more convenient

2 yii a bit more structured than codeigniter but you have a basic app up within 10 mins and if your familiar with mvc design its a great way to develop portals incredibly quickly

you can build apps a lot quicker with yii due to the code-gen and active record but it will be a bit harder to learn than codeigniter

i have worked on codeigniter but yii is far more ahead of that

should i turn my attention to yii or keep building more codeigniter projects in my portfolio for my first web developer job

yii has a higher learning curve than say codeigniter and cakephp

in looking into different frameworks the routing mechanisms they have and the different alternatives employed to make them go faster such as with codeigniter wordpress yii and symphony with alternative caching options how would you do a like-for-like is it possible

personally i d say yii might have the edge as it encourages convention more than codeigniter would

so latest codeigniter 2.0 is better than yii according to this benchmarks

i have found one benchmark in which yii is faster than codeigniter and another benchmark in which codeigniter is faster than yii

i am currently looking at yii and while its more complex than codeigniter the documentation is much more informative and therefore understandable than cakephp s


jsf	seam---------------------------------------------------

others
seam certainly is far better than using plain jsf refer the link posted by damo a couple of answers above

jsf is a web ui framework whereas seam is a more general web application framework that integrates not just jsf but conversational contexts workflow jbpm and object persistance preferably ejb3

spring security is fine too but if you plan to use jsf 2 you probably also use cdi provided by seam weld which is integrated into the java ee 6 profile from glassfish and jboss it is easier to use shiro as spring heavily relies on its own dependency injection methods although spring security does not need that much injected classes but you should stick to one way of doing things

seam is more powerful with jsf but not necessarily richfaces or icefaces for they mostly just extend the component set which is anyway fall down to standard html components when rendered by jsf

cdi is so much more mature than seam 2 bijection jsf 2 is so much easier than jsf 1.2 that any kind of application development will simply be much more fun with seam 3


viewmodel	caliburn---------------------------------------------------

others
with caliburn it is even easier since you just need to bind a property on your viewmodel to selecteditem

how can i connect a method and not a command with a binding from the viewmodel to an attached event to ask in a more general way with caliburn micro


profiler	yourkit---------------------------------------------------

others
one option is to use visualvm however a commercial profiler like yourkit may handle larger memory sizes better


svg.js	snap.svg---------------------------------------------------

the snap.svg syntax is a bit more concise the svg.js code is more readable

if you definitely need svg and want to only use existing elements you may want to look at snap.svg which is raphaels younger sister and shares a lot of the same codebase or another like svg.js


scintilla	avalonedit---------------------------------------------------

others
personally i felt that scintilla performs better than avalonedit


mktime	strtotime---------------------------------------------------

others
you d be better off using mktime for this as it s dumber than strtotime


layoutparams	viewgroup---------------------------------------------------

others
unless you know exactly what you are doing do not use the same layoutparams for more than one viewgroup


slider	jcarousel---------------------------------------------------

others
i have a div for displaying images placed at the center of a page and below that div i ve added slider displaying image thumbnails using jcarousel clicking on thumbnail images from the slider displays the bigger image inside a div positioned just above the slider and this is done using ajax i mean i m just changing the content of div to display selected image but whenever i click on thumbnail in slider for loading image the page gets scrolled and image is displayed what could be the problem pls suggest

i am using jcarousel to display more slider at once as it can be seen in the skeleton example


xna	libgdx---------------------------------------------------

others
xna + monogame --- monogame s performance seems only slightly lower than libgdx can build to most platforms

xna is more popular and has more tutorials then libgdx


cng	cryptoapi---------------------------------------------------

others
however it s important to recall that most of .net cryptography is based on cryptoapi even if cng is being more and more exposed in recent fx releases


tcpdf	fpdf---------------------------------------------------

look past better
i suggest you to give a look to tcpdf which is far better than fpdf also because it is actively developed

i ve used tcpdf in the past and found it a lot better than fpdf


others
the demonstration of tcpdf i saw at the following presentation showed that tcpdf may have more in-built capabilities the fpdf

on a side note i d recommend using tcpdf instead - it s a fork of fpdf that has better supports for utf8 among some other improvements

somewhat good news you could move to tcpdf which is much better at handling utf8 and is more modern in general than fpdf

tcpdf was always slower than fpdf

if anyone has some information on this problem i d really appreciate it - either things you did to make tcpdf faster or just confirmation that it runs slower than fpdf so i can forget about it and just stick with fpdf


avassetwriter	avassetexportsession---------------------------------------------------

others
in my experience avassetexportsession is slightly more performant than using avassetreader and avassetwriter for a straight forward format a - format b type conversion however that said it s probably not by enough to be too concerned about

this will work directly with avassetexportsession which is much easier than playing with avassetwriter unless you have a very specific requirement typically you need to manipulate the actual video frames


hash	hmac---------------------------------------------------

sha1 passwords complex
after looking it s seems that hmac is much faster and better in term of security even if the underlying hash function sha1 is broken which is not the case when using rsa-sha1

an hmac is a better way of adding your salt and pbkdf2 is based on hmac - see below for more detail on pbkdf2 - there s a good discussion at when is it safe to use a broken hash function

in django for example passwords are hash with pbkdf2 or bcrypt but session hash use a less complex hmac and no random salt


others
if your goal is simply tamper-evidence then perhaps a hmac keyed hash may be a more efficient way to go

if a key is longer than the hmac supports it ll usually be hash to the proper size

now i can understand that a ghash takes a bit longer than hmac because of the galios field and such but beeing 2 times slower compared to the slowest hash algorithm i know is insane

hmac is better than a plain hash because it is not vulnerable to hash length extension attacks

in some cases on embedded platforms where a fast hash function may not be available these may be more efficient than hmac

the structure of the hmac algorithm makes it less susceptible to attacks on properties of the underlying hash algorithm

because you can guess the top passwords and see if they have the same hash but the author points out that hmac is a more secure mechanism


typhoeus	httparty---------------------------------------------------

others
instead of net http i can use httparty curb rest client or typhoeus which makes everything easier but i can t find any similar solutions to replace enhance net ftp


gtk	clutter---------------------------------------------------

others
use clutter which is much more suited to animation and integrates with gtk


turbogears	web2py---------------------------------------------------

others
web2py may be young but the mailing list has 2000 messages month which is similar to django and far more than turbogears


dplyr	tidyr---------------------------------------------------

others
one possibility is to use dplyr piping and tidyr see more about them here and here

now use dplyr to grab the appropriate level from levels data.frame then spread this back out to short form using tidyr and delete no longer needed id


qtreeview	qstandarditemmodel---------------------------------------------------

others
tried comboboxes with qsqlquerymodel without threading to improve performance but experienced it works much slower than qstandarditemmodel in our project qsqlquerymodel works very fast with such amount of data with qtreeview for example


autoresetevent	manualresetevent---------------------------------------------------

others
edit this is why autoresetevent does not have a slim version - basically it s because the wait times of autoresetevent are typically longer than manualresetevent so it isn t appropriate to use busy spinning


django	turbogears---------------------------------------------------

others
web2py may be young but the mailing list has 2000 messages month which is similar to django and far more than turbogears

compare the very active django tag on stack overflow with that of pylons or turbogears though and i d argue getting started is simply easier with django irrespective of anything to do with code

as well for all i know turbogears 2 or django have stronger support for exposing web services out of the box.


weka	mallet---------------------------------------------------

others
i have tried weka too but mallet is smarter than weka on this aspect


union	distinct---------------------------------------------------

better sort first
union all performs better than union union works like distinct first order by then remove duplicates

the union all with a distinct gives better performance though i believe..

so union is much better than the union all with distinct in performance-wise

the union can result in better performing subqueries which makes up for the increased computation for removing distinct values

union all will perform better than union when you re not concerned about eliminating duplicate records because you re avoiding an expensive distinct sort operation

i don t think you can do much better than 3 union maybe the last 2 can be combined with count distinct

union all is better than union because it avoids a sort you know you ll get a distinct set because you re joining on two different tables


others
it s common to use either strings or enums for these in c# java but discriminated union seem more appropriate in f# because these are distinct read-only values

then you might switch to except all similar to union all which might be more efficient than union because it avoids the distinct operation

it sounds to me like you are asking for the union of the filtered session values from the two tables and as you want the distinct set you do want union rather than union all union all is actually a much more common requirement than union


note resultset data
a side note since you want all rows using union all is faster since it does not need to perform a distinct to eliminate duplicates

i am currently using union all and a distinct in the outer query as this proved much faster than using union s for the uniqueness of data

the difference is that union all is faster than union due to the fact that union eliminates duplicates from the resultset by using select distinct


slower quicker tables
however the tables are huge and the union all i read its faster than distinct takes forever to execute even with just two tables let alone 6

using union all is quicker than using union since a distinct check does not need to be done

i have experienced situations where union s made a query much slower than union all with a distinct afterwards

union forces a distinct to occur and there s little slower than distinct

the union might be slower due to it attempting to get the distinct values

union all is generally faster than using distinct or grouping

keep in mind that union will return a distinct list - duplicates will be removed but it will perform slower than using union all which will not remove duplicates

that s one reason why omitting distinct and replacing union by union all is much faster


robocopy	xcopy---------------------------------------------------

better
xcopy will not be better than robocopy at this

also robocopy is better than xcopy


others
you might want look at robocopy as it has many more options than xcopy

btw this is not essential for this solution for windows 7 and 10 xcopy is superseded by robocopy which is much more performant and powerful

i have solved it in the past very successfully using robocopy it s much more robust than xcopy

use robocopy it s much more powerful than xcopy

xcopy was older and unreliable so microsoft replaced it with robocopy which is still rubbish

if your batch file only needs to run on windows vista or later you can use robocopy instead which is an even more powerful tool than xcopy and is now built into the operating system

the robocopy command provides a more intelligent exclusion feature switches xd and xf than xcopy does which you could use for your task

that would theoretically cut the time in half but it seems that robocopy is much faster than xcopy at least for this use so it took way less time


quicksort	insertion-sort---------------------------------------------------

others
in cs insertion-sort is less commonly used because we have much better algorithms quicksort and merge-sort come to mind


time-efficient faster linkedlist
i think that insertion-sort would be much faster then quicksort when sorting a linkedlist

it seems that when sorting insertion-sort would be more time-efficient then quicksort when sorting a linkedlist


cstring	bstr---------------------------------------------------

others
a cstring is more like a visual basic string or a bstr


trie	tree---------------------------------------------------

children dawg representation
for cases where each node in the trie has most of its children used the trie is substantially more space efficient and time efficient than th ternary search tree

however that space overhead can be reduced by compressing the trie using the patricia tree representation using a more efficient data structure to store child pointers or building a dawg from the trie

for example the patricia trie or the radix tree that is far more space efficient than an hash table for strings but of course being a tree lookup computational complexity is o log n and building it is o n log n


wiki dummy dictionary
a radix tree will provide a better memory usage for strings than a regular trie if you have a lot of strings with common roots prefixes which is probably the case for a dictionary words with many forms - although that would probably depend on the language

also you can use redix trie or suffix tree these are far better suited for this kind of operations and much faster but they require a pre-processing of the data and might require more processing power

most likely a trie is more efficient and you didn t sort your dictionary and it doesn t use a binary tree or ternary tree

the article says that a trie is better than binary tree as for a string of length m for trie it takes o m time and for binary tree it takes o m logn time

a suffix tree is more or less an advanced trie here you can also search for any substrings in o c as for the trie

recursive is usually used for traversal and binary search tree but this tree is more similar to trie of only 2 character in alphabet

as suggested a trie would be more efficient than a binary tree but you can use a hashmap and hash each word

a trie is better suited to this kind of thing because it lets you store your symbols as a tree and quickly parse it to match values or reject them

the suffix tree is lighter and faster than the trie and is used to index dna or optimize some large web search engines

use a radix tree wiki or trie wiki if you are concerned about performance.the radix tree is more memory efficient compared to a trie

note that while a trie works for the specific case of keys which are strings a binary search tree is much more general and only requires that the keys can be ordered

a trie is better than a binary search tree for searching elements

in this case a general trie might be easier to deal than the more specialized radix tree but the requirements in space are a bit higher

a suffix tree has less dummy nodes than the suffix trie


others
i ve implemented a n-ary tree to be more specific a trie and i was wondering if there s a method to represent and traverse it as a vector

a trie or perhaps a van emde boas tree might be a better bet for creating a space efficient set of integers with lookup time bring constant against the number of objects in the data structure assuming that even std bitset would be too large

another suggested reason is that deletions from a array mapped trie are more expensive tha from a b tree

should i change my project to trie or is there any other good reasons where avl tree woud be more efficient than trie in case of phonebook

instead there comes a point much earlier where a trie or a ternary tree become better options

ps radix tree is usually faster and more compact then trie but suffers from the same side effects of trie comparing to hash tables though less significant of course

in my use case i don t anticipate the trie to grow more than 2-3 levels in depth so if your tree gets very complex you might want to analyze performance issues and see if the additional lookups will cause too much overheads

finally b+ tree is admittedly more difficult to implement than a trie it s more on a red-black tree level of complexity


associativity	logical-or---------------------------------------------------

others
i looked it up and the logical-or operator has a higher precedence than the conditional operator and the conditional operator has right-to-left associativity


daemons	systemd---------------------------------------------------

others
in my case i have the daemons doing more than 1 thing so it s very helpful to have systemd keep track of all the timers for me so that i can effectively poll stream_select for the xmpp connection

so me and a friend are coding a small systemd monitor learn better fun the code has 2 sections the daemons and the command line interface for now when i compile the cli section all went great the daemons is particular one because when i compile and i execute it in the compile directory it works without error

as a new newbie programmer i find that making daemons over systemd is much easier than over init.d

error response from daemons cannot start container d13b8aa28d383a3ca54b39ce74f5a81d80030a2ad0dde52966293ced9ef26663 8 systemd error exec mesos-master executable file not found in path

use daemons mode and then simply touching the wsgi script file when an atomic set of changes have been completed isn t that hard and certainly safer than a systemd which restarts arbitrarily when it detects any single change

modern unix-based systemd have better timers clock_gettime than gettimeofday that are not subject to changes made by the network time protocol daemons

on my systemd i have more than one web daemons running one of them is apache which is listening on ports 80 and 443

if you can t get it to work try get your daemons to provide more verbose logging about why it s not starting or resort to adding usr bin strace to the beginning of your line to get detailed logging of the systemd calls that the binary is making during startup


beanstalk	amazon-web-services---------------------------------------------------

better pm2 place
i have successfully deploy pm2 on amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk it has more than one way to achieve

maybe the amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk are a better place for your needs


others

notepad++	jedit---------------------------------------------------

others
i have found that jedit has better plugins for providing some of the more ide-oriented capabilities but like boltclock said notepad++ is really just a powerful text editor and does not try to be a one-stop-shop ide

i think jedit is equal to or better than notepad++


rbac	acl---------------------------------------------------

others
in your example i would suggest to use rbac rather than acl because rbac is more flexible for enhancements and maintenance which will be always in system like university management system


udp	mtu---------------------------------------------------

size packets smaller
if udp payload size is bigger than mtu size udp will silently segment the packet

udp packets greater than the mtu size of the network that carries them will be automatically split up into multiple packets and then reassembled by the recipient

when send a udp datagram larger than the mtu size only the last fragment of the udp datagram is putted out to the destination

if there is network congestion rate limiting or traffic profiling or if the udp message size is larger than the mtu

when udp data size is smaller 1452 than ppp mtu no error

note that udp packets bigger than the mtu s at every hope between your hosts will be split by ip

if you send a udp datagram larger than the mtu it will be fragmented

3 you are sending messages that are bigger than the udp max message size 4 each device in your network has a max message size mtu so you might be exceeding a limit there

in real life udp packets size usually is equal or less than mtu size

ideally your udp frames are smaller than the mtu for your architecture say 1500 bytes so the messages won t get chopped up in transit

my another question is if i put the data size smaller than mtu into sendto then i can gurantee call sendto once socket only sends one tcp udp packet

basically while sending udp packets larger than mtu ip fragmentation can occur if it s supported on your platform but not all platforms support it

my another question is if i put the data size smaller than mtu into sendto then i can guarantee call sendto once socket only sends one tcp udp packet

in addition to the suppositions in question 4 supposing that my message is no bigger than the mtu - udp header - ip header size is the udp datagram that results guaranteed to fit into 1 ip packet on my local network at least

my lwip can send udp packets to pc but my pc would fail to reassemble when the udp packets are larger than mtu

ever since i did sockets programming on a pdp 11 it s been the case that ip fragmentation will take care of the case where an ip datagram such as a udp datagram is larger than the mtu for the segment allows

udp packets smaller than the mtu will not be fragmented but the mtu depends on more factors such as ip options and vlan headers so it may not be greater than 1500

udp uses datagrams chunks of data which are received whole on the other side unless the size is bigger than the mtu but that s a different story


byte faster ethernet
for example i read an experiment in which a stream of 300 byte packets was being sent over ethernet 1500 byte mtu and tcp was 50 faster than udp

i read in a case where a stream of 300 byte packets was being sent over ethernet 1500 byte mtu and tcp was 50 faster than udp


others
to send large blocks of data via udp you need to chop them up into pieces smaller than the mtu for the network segment across which you re transmitting them

i am working on udp socket programming and i have to stop the transmission in application if requested data is more than mtu value

in practice each payloaded buffer will represent 1 udp packet unless your network mtu is smaller then what you have configured on the payload see mtu property

the mtu is closer to 1500 and this applies to tcp not udp

so for example if you send a 63k udp packet and it goes over ethernet it will get broken up into 47+ smaller fragment packets because ethernet s mtu is 1500 bytes but some of those are used for udp headers etc so the amount of user-data-space available in a udp packet is smaller than that


package larger datagram
they are easily generated for udp simply by making the datagram bigger than the mtu

what would happen if my udp package is larger than mtu


poltergeist	capybara-webkit---------------------------------------------------

others
capybara-webkit was more complicated to set up than poltergeist because it requires a screen and it has many dependencies


apache	lighttpd---------------------------------------------------

mode long traditional
if you aren t using any of the other features of apache consider using something lighter and faster like lighttpd or nginx

using a different server such as one apache and one nginx or one apache and one lighttpd will be much easier because their configuration files don t conflict with each other

letâ s encrypt provides great scripts for apache 2 and nginx but not lighttpd which is much more comfortable for small systems like raspberry pi or old boxes

it may even use a different server software say nginx or lighttpd that has less overhead than the traditional apache setup

as such i m assuming that about 96 of our users will being using apache and not lighttpd or nginx which are supposedly more suited for long polling

nginx or lighttpd in fastcgi mode use less ram than apache and they can handle more concurrent connections

for instance in some benchmarks lighttpd is even faster at serving static resources than apache

i know how to use apache but since i was hosting the webserver on a small raspbery pi i felt lighttpd would be just more lighter

- if you move towards more static content or go the fastcgi way lighttpd is faster than apache

just one tip if only job for the http server will be just proxying the play apps consider using some lighter option than apache for an example nginx or lighttpd you ll find sample configurations for all of them in play s documentation


lower front number
theoretically because of a smaller footprint lighttpd should allow more users to visit site at the same time using exactly the same resources as apache would

i have read in a site that another benefit of having lighttpd in front of apache is lower number of child processes

since you ve switched to lighttpd the webserver itself is going to use fewer resources than apache would but apache is rarely the bottleneck unless you ve run out of ram or seriously misconfigured it


others
this is my first experience setting up lighttpd as i thought it would be more suitable than apache in this case

i have recently started using lighttpd instead of apache and found it more usable and fast

unlike a proper server like lighttpd whose cpu usage is undetectable the crummy via c7 was serving 100 http hits s and lighttpd used less than 1 cpu apache will kill your box

the benefit of both apache is more powerful and extensible useless if you don t need that power but anyway... and lighttpd is faster at static content


mdx	dax---------------------------------------------------

others
the calculation language is dax which is an improvement on the horrible mdx - dax reads more like excel functions


put	get---------------------------------------------------

view smaller strings.xml
i need to form a layout in which i want to put an image in the upper 50 of the screen two edittext two button in the lower 50 of the screen and also it should be device independent so that the view doesn t get disturbed on smaller or bigger screens it works fine on minimum 3.2 hvga device but everything goes overlapped if run on a even smaller device

put the string in strings.xml set it to a text view inside a scroll view so that it doesn t get hidden on smaller screens set autolink to make the links clickable


others
i put dummy joptionpane pop-ups in various areas to confirm my code was getting there and it appears it is all executing but no balls ever get drawn much less drawn over and over to make them move and bounce around the screen

to get your code to run more than once put it in a while loop

if it is something that is used in more than one place or even something that might get used more than once then put it in app.xaml

also i can do a single ingredient but how would i put together a query to get recipes given more than one ingredient

from this point of view if a class has members which don t need to be protected for example a boolean which its corresponding get set functions can be freely changed by the user is better to put that attributes as public and remove the get set functions more or less these are the bjarne stroustrup words

for example if i put 40 as value there will i get charged more

network latency is ruled out because get requests take more or less same time as local machine whereas time taken to first byte is more for post and put requests

the idea is that the server generally has more information about the resource than the user and so get might return more information than is required for put

is there any easier way than put all in set and get set size

i m struggling to know how to put it back together with the multi-index and then how to get the 2016 values that were either higher or lower than the min max already recorded

so it s really odd because google penalizes the apps that do put all their code files in and update frequently because these get checked more often

addendum i didn t get to add earlier this little bit is what i would have put before seeing barry houdini s answer

if you put -c lower than 80 itâ s going to make it less likely that you get

i m try to host videos on s3 and to put data transfer limits so i don t get charged for more than say 20gb any way to do that

2 in my office there s a lot of lack of line spacing because you get to see more of the code on one page that way. they also put multiple statements on one line and over imho use

if you want to get more out of infowindow and put html content in them i would recommend trying infobox

i resorted to split the two in swagger list-without-search as get and list+search as post just to put the page in the swagger documentation also if the latter actually works also as get

i m concerned this is going to get worse as we put more tests into the specflow project

but its a good practice to always put the brackets to help making your code easier to read so you wouldn t get confused in more complex algorithms

i believe what s happening is that odata uses merge verb that is more efficient than put put requires sending all fields while merge sends only changed data but in your model field b is marked as required so you get a validation exception on the client side

if you can still get the object after i don t think i would use delete but put may be more appropriate

bowler is pretty much scalatra + scalate with some enforcing nudging of the developer towards good restful practices such as proper use of content-type and accept http headers for responding and emitting html and json and dealing with get post delete and put in appropriate ways and making bad uses of get and delete harder

you should also put the more detailed route first so it will not get swallowed by more generic one

however i m not sure how to get these working or more importantly where to put them

i have put a button for each row which i want to create on click event for it to get the id of that row and be able to send user to second page to edit that row info but i have problem with checking this multiple button if it were checkbox it was easier

buggy plugins -- even if the plugin exists across all operating systems like flash generally they work best on windows and then linux and mac fight it out for second place usually more effort put into the mac port but on linux there may be wiki guides to get it working better and the distro packagers may use these tricks when auto-installing the plugin for you

however if i attempt to put or paste with more links than currently exist i get the following error

one way is to just output the content of the article and put a read more tag in the text and you ll get the text outputted with the read more button after it

i get black image and if i put start more then 0 i got white gradient but no image

from an interface design standpoint you want user-agents to make post and put and delete more difficult than get or at least distinctly different so that users can rely on that difference to hint when their actions might cause a change in the resource state because they are responsible for those changes

we even setup replicas outside aws using stunnel and put ssd drives as the primary block device and we get ridiculous read speeds for our reporting systems - literally 100 times faster than we get from rds

pre-aggregation with counters requires 1 get + 1 put which is more expensive than just puts

if you put donald trump on it as sender you might get sued for more money than you can imagine

anything you put in a header is likely to appear twice when compiling a single file because headers often get included by other headers so they get included more than once

now don t get me wrong regenerating the session id on login or more accurately as oswap put it on privilege level change is indeed a very good defense against session fixation

here i just put the code within each case and the code doesnt get called more then once

it s no matter what limit i put it create more less pages i can navigate between them with next and prev links but all this stop working when i trying to get 31+ item

but the slider won t work well it doesn t get activated is a better way to put it if i insert the code from slider.js into the chrome console hit enter - booom works perfectly i ve been looking for what the problem might be tried adding the type text javascript in the script tags added the document .ready in my jquery still nothing.

get and post are relatively common put is less common so may not be covered in your server implementation

i have been thinking about something after the master makes de inquiry and paging process when up to 7 devices are set as active members active member address and the rest up to 256 are put on parked more 8 bit parked member address or hold or sniff this two last ones doesnt get a mac

you got at least put and delete although they are used much less frequent than get and post as in hardly ever

the data collection and storage parts of that stack are already done and i just need to get querying done made more difficult by the fact that the new system queries can take 10+ seconds to complete but can be queried on any dimension and a tool to process the historical data and put it into the new storage engine

the main method does little more than to get the program running here to create a jframe to put the main gui code s jpanel in and then display that jframe

i basically know zilch of java but i m hoping someone can help me put something into that .parse function that would get me post that have dateupdated newer than 5 days

and then i saw that they put functions under transform that did much more than just get data

this should be producing a topological sort but so far i consistently get one value less than i put in as far as number of vertices and none of the number match those i ve inputted

given the explain plan you posted i suspect you ll probably struggle to get it to run any faster unless you put run on better hardware with faster cpu

if you want to do more than just get the uniq output you could put your own java class or command line program rather than use usr bin uniq

what implementations allow me to put a limit on the throughput that is guarantee that a certain actor does not get executed more than n times per minute

any information i can get would be better than nothing so please feel free to put in partial answers


loop small q.empty
as long as the dataframe is small your assumption that the put process is faster than the get seems true we can fetch all 5 items within one loop of while not q.empty

when i put my loop counter variable pagessent in the watch window it gets optmized when i declare as volatile it still gets optimized but when the max value is set to 4 the loop exits properly but if max value is higher than 4 get stuck..


data post methods
how can i get rid of the post put data getting exponentially bigger

i was digging through the flask pluggable views documentation and while i find the methodview to be very helpful for making restful crud endpoints usually i end up wanting more than just get post put delete methods under a base route with common decorators and so forth

restful services does not implement an exact way to transfer the info you can use path query string form string or even multipart data so you can do it as you want but in your case instead of using get method with all the data in the query a post or put is more appropiate and you will not hit the query string limit

since most data-storage mechanisms in-ram in a database etc. get a lot slower as you put more data in them you should ensure you re only timing your http access and not looking at overall crawler throughput including storage

data should be in post or get.if you dont put your data in your form then you will have to use get which is less secure than post


better js map
is that better than just get the .js already compiled and put it on vendor folder

you need to put all of your code in your get do block or better in a helper file module

if you will only use put remove get it s better to choose map

right now i would have to say the put method is better since it works and i could not get the webservice to work


time entries hashmap
first thing that came to mind was that it was caused of too many entries in the hashmap which caused every put and every get to be slower every time

i m currently in school and usually spend my time here on stackoverflow looking for answers to homework this time i d thought that perhaps i ll put my code here and maybe i ll get help more precis and quicker


width height perspective
and i m just having trouble saying if the image original file s width is greater than the height then we need the height to expand to the height of the surrounding element and put the width at auto so it doesn t get squished but keeping in mind that the client can upload any image size they want with no restrictions of must be 350x350

to put this in perspective the current project i am working on involves comparing the width and height of an image to get a number to determine if the width is longer than the height or the same


post url better
both get post user can put any thing in it and you must filter any input that user make it in your form example the value in textfiled sent to server by post method and that don t make it safer than get method the difference between them that the textfiled value doesn t visible in url

so since it is only semantic you can do whatever you want in the controller once you get the request and i suppose your rest-api does not include complex updates of say a part of a list or specific fields in nested objects - i believe put would be the better choice

you could manage more than get or post like put delete...

q1.i know that post is better than put for name-value pair parameters as the get exposes it in url and post doesn t

you have mentioned that we can t use actions more than get post put delete which is not true

you can change the http verb near the url parameter to get post put delete or more


greater vc argument
but i get compiler warning c4309 truncation of constant value in vc++ 2010 whenever the argument to put is greater than 0x7f

the reason why you get the exception mentioned is because when you call byte.parse but the string that you put in is greater than 255


faster threads project
this could mean that put is now slower than get and we have to wait

at times the get rate is slower than the put rate and we see messages backing up

on the one hand we can say let s put 20 threads and get it done faster

you ll get it done much faster by just looking at the sample project i put together


requests second bucket
if you expect a rapid increase in the request rate for a bucket to more than 300 put list delete requests per second or more than 800 get requests per second we recommend that you open a support case to prepare for the workload and avoid any temporary limits on your request rate

i m not sure if this is the answer but states that if you expect a rapid increase in the request rate for a bucket to more than 300 put list delete requests per second or more than 800 get requests per second we recommend that you open a support case to prepare for the workload and avoid any temporary limits on your request rate

at very high speeds amazon s3 does have some recommended request rate and performance considerations but this is only when making more than 300 put list delete requests per second or more than 800 get requests per second for a particular bucket


number different series
if you are uncertain you can always put an if statement and check if the number you get back is highter then int.maxvalue

from the count you will get the number of sequence and those which have more than 2 put those in a different series and then add that series in the dataframe


file command complex
if you need to do anything more complex than put file or get file take a look at edtftpj free

as i am benchmarking my cluster i discover that for large file my get command is actually slower than put command


let	curry---------------------------------------------------

others
despite the fact that using the iife approach would let you do more than just one function call in the anonymous method are there any disadvantages to swapping it out for the curry approach


uiviewcontroller	uiwindow---------------------------------------------------

others
if more than one uiviewcontroller hangs off the applicationâ s uiwindow only one of these will get the messages for changes in orientation


xlib	xcb---------------------------------------------------

others
the xcb library is alternative to xlib which is much better all around and supports a non-blocking interface but it doesn t play well with opengl

xcb is simpler to use has a better response to a multithread environment but lacks documentation while xlib is a more dated complex tool better documented and fully implemented

xcb is lower level than xlib and allows you to minimise the number of round-trips to the x server leading to lower latency

xcb presents a more direct view of the protocol than xlib does so you often have to look at either the protocol specs or xlib source code to find out what the underlying protocol request is to find an equivalent


udp	tftp---------------------------------------------------

others
tftp is used because it uses udp which is simpler and had a smaller footprint than a full tcp-based ftp server


gruntjs	package.json---------------------------------------------------

others
dist fonts gruntjs gruntfile.js js less license package.json readme.md


stringr	stringi---------------------------------------------------

others
stringr provides more human-readable wrappers around the base r functions though as of dec 2014 the development version has a branch built on top of stringi mentioned below

stringr is newer based on stringi internally and is often even faster

you may also want to consider exploring the stringi package which has a similar approach to stringr but has more flexible functions


lasagne	tensorflow---------------------------------------------------

others
it is similar in spirit to keras which is built as a high-level api on top of theano tensorflow cntk although the main difference is that lasagne implements only one backend allowing it to integrate more deeply with theano features


cvs	svn---------------------------------------------------

others
based on what you quoted it appears that git and svn are actually more similar than either is to cvs for example

the other distributed tools are a lot faster svn is slow as hell even cvs can be faster sometimes have much more useful features than svn are developing rapidly while seeing any new feature in svn takes years

i ve used svn not cvs as stated earlier for a while and have some projects in git

in this case i converted the cvs to svn and found the file size on the hard drive it was on my own laptop at the time but it was much smaller in svn than in cvs but there could have been some compression applied i dont know but everything on the web said svn would actually be bigger than cvs

in fact svn does stores binaries a lot more efficient than cvs for more info see the svn-faq

in addition another coworker said cvs was a lot more popular than svn

the first one can be solved by using svn +ssh which is the more comparable format as cvs uses its own protocol as well

for all the reasons linked in the comment and elsewhere svn tends to be a much better enviroment than cvs or vss unless you have some weird requirements - so if you can successfully import your history and save the company money i wouldn t see why the bosses wouldn t go for it

wondering mainly if svn uses less disk space or more than the same in cvs


part point means
managing changes that need to be made across these branches is a lot easier with svn than it was with cvs but it s by no means pain-free

part of the point of svn was to make the use of branches and merging much easier than in cvs


better readers simplications
svn is much better then cvs and git or mercurial are even better again

svn is better than cvs

so what is with svn that your company dislikes so much and cvs does better

svn in much better than cvs and have lot of mature tools for every platform

many say that svn was build to be a better cvs and in almost all aspects svn is better and is widely used

svn was supposed to be better than cvs but in some areas that didn t work well

i can only guess at the reasons and i don t worry much about the occasional downvote but perhaps some readers think i m advocating cvs as a better system than svn or git

that being said i think svn is better in every other respect and you probably shouldn t start a new project with cvs

svn is better than cvs because it was designed to be - it s roughly the same thing with some simplications and new features

if you use svn then it still okay because svn handles binary files much better than cvs


do.call	lapply---------------------------------------------------

others
or break it up into two function calls lapply and then do.call to make it more understandable what s going on


trac	bugzilla---------------------------------------------------

others
trac s issue tracking is little better than bugzilla s...i know a lot of folks love trac but i find it very inflexible

i would suggest something more modern than bugzilla such as trac or lighthouse although bugzilla may fit your bill

if you really want something with php then i guess bugzilla but imho trac is better

i think you ll find that your team will like either trac or redmine more than bugzilla or mantis


loops	if-statement---------------------------------------------------

others
nevertheless i need a dynamic list for my loops with nested loops which is processed more than 500 times and multiple if-statement therefore the arraylist


processors	hyperthreading---------------------------------------------------

older modern law
first amdahl s law is older than hyperthreading so the law itself assumes you have physical processors

more modern processors handle hyperthreading better than older processors


others
you may find that hyperthreading helps more on code that is using large amounts of memory so that the processors is regularly blocked on fetching from memory

in computer 1 the eigen3 performance is worse because the number of total processors virtual + physical - â due to hyperthreading is greater than the number of physical processors

it might be that latency of various instructions is much better covered by the processors thanks to hyperthreading or cache behavior as sizes differ

processors with hyperthreading can have more than one logical core per physical core

vcpu reg are virtual cpu registers that exist on many processors that have things like multiple cores hyperthreading or other features that enable higher layers to believe that there is more than one cpu present when there isn t -- such as today s x86s

first step would be to investigate why a processors with hyperthreading simultaneous multithreading could lead to poorer performances than a processors without this technology


technology core technologies
the rule of thumb is that if a cpu is given more than double the count of actively running threads as it has execution units these are the physical cores on a cpu chip and logical processors like hyperthreading technology that splits one core into two then the os will spend more time scheduling threads and switching between them cache-thrashing than it will spend actually running the threads

however often laptop processors will have more logical cores than physical cores due to hyperthreading or other technologies


percentile	max---------------------------------------------------

others
if you notice the 99th percentile is less than 40mb but the max sized partition is still reported to be 3.44gb

i can get the max values like this but i need values greater than 95th percentile for every 5 minutes

the code included in the sapply call will test each day starting from day n. 7+1 8 against the 15-day sliding window as defined before and check if the max temperature is higher than the 90th percentile of that window test1


xuggle	vlcj---------------------------------------------------

others
apart from that you might want to give xuggle a try - it works on a much lower level than vlcj but this should give you much more control over what s happening and unlike jmf it s a good actively maintained project.


createelement	classname---------------------------------------------------

others
on the other hand passing an element and its attributes like maps to a call to document.createdocumentfragment which is slower than createelement followed by a write to the classname property


libstdc++	libc++---------------------------------------------------

ndk libc++abi llvm
in crystax ndk both gnu libstdc++ and llvm libc++ are much more stable and fully conforming to c++ standard at least at the same level as they conform to it on gnu linux

if you want to use c++11 you either need to use clang with libc++ or install a newer gcc to get a newer libstdc++

note that there s much more than llvm and clang these compilers also rely on c++ standard libraries both have libc++ libc++abi mostly unchanged pnacl used to support libstdc++ c standard libraries both have musl pnacl also has newlib bionic some form of glibc compiler runtime compiler-rt linker and general user libraries such as sdl part of emscripten and for pnacl in webports


others
the above links to libc++ which is the preferred c++ standard library for mac os x with clang and a lot more complete than libstdc++ even when considering the newest gcc

libc++ is not 100 complete on gnu linux and there s no real advantage to using it when libstdc++ is more complete

libstdc++ does this a lot more than libc++ and the former is the default library for llvm-g++ gcc llvm the latter for clang apple llvm which means a lot of errors will seem to go away when you switch to gcc llvm or just stick with apple llvm and switch your library but your code is still wrong


atom-editor	lighttable---------------------------------------------------

others
but although atom-editor looks so nice and powerful compared to simple editors with realy huuuge number of available packages plugins lighttable is more elegant


nlopt	quadprog---------------------------------------------------

others
for quadprog ipopt would be a much more powerful solver than nlopt


attoparsec	uu-parsinglib---------------------------------------------------

others
if you are decoding some formatted file rather than something like a programming language attoparsec or similar might be better than parsec or uu-parsinglib


mutators	getter---------------------------------------------------

others
these methods which give us access to private members are known as getter setter or better knows as accessor mutators


mockups	balsamiq---------------------------------------------------

others
if you are looking for something not as complex as axure justinmind but more powerful than moqups balsamiq you could also consider infragisticsâ indigo studio which can import static mockups from balsamiq and make them interactive and protoshare


photoshop	fireworks---------------------------------------------------

others
i find fireworks has an easier time dealing with vectors because they re first class objects while in photoshop they re actually a combination of a vector mask and a colour fill

i have fireworks 8 as well as photoshop cs3 on my windows pc but i m more familiar with fireworks


pylons	pyramid---------------------------------------------------

others
but pyramid would be a better choice to learn right now as pylons is not actively developed


uialertview	uiwindow---------------------------------------------------

others
the internal view hierarchy of uialertview is much more complicated than it appears and starting from ios 7 it is not even added to any uiwindow so it s no big surprise that it doesn t participate to the responder chain as you expect


filesystems	xfs---------------------------------------------------

others
although i myself have prior experience in implementing filesystems much simpler ones than ntfs xfs or ext2 i would not tackle this job

ext4 is a reasonably mature modern filesystems while xfs is older but still quite reliable

a filesystems such as xfs is more suitable for this

some filesystems such as xfs try harder to provide good aio behaviour in comparison other filesystems but even there a user still has to be very careful as to avoid operations that will trigger synchrony

actual mounting of filesystems is trickier business and really depends on what you are mounting - ntfs fat ext3 xfs nfs cifs webdav etc etc


haskell	ocaml---------------------------------------------------

others
the reason i wanted to investigate this was because both c and ocaml were significantly faster than haskell for this program

disclaimer i am more familiar with haskell than ocaml so i may not be doing things in the most idiomatic way

haskell has higher level bindings to llvm than ocaml the haskell ones provide some interesting type safety guarantees and haskell has by far more libraries to use 1700 packages on making it easier to glue together components

haskell has fewer industrial users than ocaml and although it does have multicore support it is still being developed in a very unproductive direction

secondly the haskell ffi is more powerful that is it does more with less code than ocaml s and more libraries are avaliable via hackage so i don t think foreign interfaces will be a deciding factor

the haskell zipwith is friendlier than the ocaml list.map2 which requires the lists to be the same length

haskell has more momentum these days but there are plenty of good parsing libraries for ocaml as well including the peg parser generator aurochs menhir and the glr parser generator dypgen

you will also likely find the performance characteristics of your ocaml code more intuitive than haskell because of haskell s lazy evaluation

i m more familiar with ocaml than haskell so type constructor may not be the right term

note that it currently does not support true parallelism you won t have two threads running ocaml code in parallel but it doesn t matter as ocaml is much faster than many other languages for example on a quadcore the language shootout shows that ocaml outperforms even haskell with multicore capabilities

as others have pointed out ocaml s learning curve will be lower than haskell s

if you want only very coarse parallelism at best and you intend to stick with mostly functional structures then pick based on something else like syntax i think haskell is much nicer here but that s subjective or available libraries haskell wins on quantity availability but ocaml might edge it out in the graphics department nonetheless

if i remember correctly they initially experimented with haskell but then decided ocaml was more practical

i would just use ocaml but haskell s syntax is so much better than ocaml s and haskell is pure and has cool features such as type classes


type system holes
i ve heard people complaining about haskell s type system having holes and that agda and ocaml coq are better

keith pointed out that haskell has a more powerful type system but it can also be said that ocaml has a more powerful module system than haskell


ml miranda alice
it loses points for being about standard ml when ocaml f# and haskell are seemingly more popular

haskell ml ocaml miranda alice oz erlang twelf coq prolog all demonstrate more rigorous applications of mathematics to programming


functional stuff little
overminddl1 if you want to learn functional typed programming something like haskell will teach you better than almost any other language however ocaml will be the best if you want to write to get stuff done

ocaml will be easier to learn if you coming from almost any other language this is because haskell is as function as functional languages get and working with mutable random access structures can be a little clunky in haskell

ocaml is closer to c++ because of it s imperative and oo features but i recommend you learn haskell as it is more functional more mindbending and has more resources


resharper	justcode---------------------------------------------------

others
together resharper was finding more than justcode


tablet	galaxy---------------------------------------------------

others
nexus one has 32mb galaxy nexus - 64mb tablet can have even more

minor differences between two identical target devices samsung galaxy tab 10.1 one tablet always performs fares better

i ve tested this on a few devices a nexus 10 tablet which gets the bigger version of the file from the xhdpi folder a generic tablet using mdpi a galaxy ace phone mdpi again and everything works ok

i can t use screens size because of devices like galaxy note with huge screens and some phones have higher resolution than some tablet same with dpi i think

i ve tested this on an emulator running with haxm 2gbram 256heap size and a galaxy tab of which i don t know the type anymore both having the same problem altough the tablet can handle more entities before the loop begins


note xiaomi samsung
so for example a galaxy note 1 calling a gs3 experiences more delay than a galaxy note 1 calling nexus 7 tablet asus and galaxy note 1 calling a xiaomi mi-2 phone

tablet have larger displays but the pixel density is not as high as on for example the iphone 4 samsung galaxy nexus etc


selenium	appium---------------------------------------------------

others
if you really want to use selenium inside an android app you might have better luck with appium

you can use appium more mobile oriented than selenium and you can use c# to write your tests


xmlhttprequest	jqxhr---------------------------------------------------

others
so i d rename xmlhttprequest to jqxhr which is more dogmatic jquery

jquery jqxhr - see jqxhr.setrequestheader x-requested-with xmlhttprequest


distance	altitude---------------------------------------------------

others
a negative verticalaccuracy signifies that altitude is invalid whereas normally a smaller but positive value of verticalaccuracy actually means that altitude is more precise since it s the vertical distance that it may be off by - i ll leave the discussion as to why this measure is called verticalaccuracy and not verticalinaccuracy for some other time


coldspring	model-glue---------------------------------------------------

others
fortunately model-glue has tight integration with coldspring a popular bean container for cfml and model-glue 3 makes it easier than ever to use coldspring beans in your controllers


gridview	detailsview---------------------------------------------------

others
at the bottom there s a partial code of a form i m trying to build it has only the upper gridview and details view for now but you can see my problem in the screenshot i took the erased row has personal data the gridview and the detailsview drops lower then the second centered subtitle


mouseup	mouseenter---------------------------------------------------

others
this may make for various race conditions and may necessitate using events which give you earlier notification than mouseup mousedown mouseenter mouseleave mouseover mouseout


admob	inmobi---------------------------------------------------

others
i set ecpm for inmobi and mobfox higher than for admob


jasmine	qunit---------------------------------------------------

others
performing this asynchronous testing is actually possible in qunit but is handled better in another javascript testing framework jasmine js

aviran made a great suggestion with qunit but i think jasmine is better suited for new developers because of its readability and bdd -ness

jasmine is clearly more bdd focused than qunit although i could see doing bdd with qunit by describing the tests in a behavior-oriented way


keydown	mouseup---------------------------------------------------

others
logic to handle enter + mouse click is placed on keydown and mousedown it could be moved to keyup and mouseup if makes more sense


uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller---------------------------------------------------

rotations settoolbaritems class
the uinavigationcontroller class seems to handle better rotations than uiviewcontroller

or there should also be a method settoolbaritems animated on the uiviewcontroller not the uinavigationcontroller which is perhaps better


others
3c why does my uiviewcontroller which is inside my uinavigationcontroller has a longer height than the uinavigationcontroller

basically if the user is on a view under the more tab the actual current uinavigationcontroller you want to use to push a uiviewcontroller onto is the uitabbarcontroller s morenavigationcontroller property

the uinavigationcontroller is more of a behind-the-scenes organizer for holding and displaying other uiviewcontroller s

the framespace for the uiviewcontroller becomes smaller because uinavigationcontroller manipulates the view by adding a uinavigationbar which is 44.0f in size

add one more uinavigationcontroller between uitabbarcontroller and uiviewcontroller

the app uses a uinavigationcontroller that never has more than 1 uiviewcontroller on it s stack


alarmmanager	timertask---------------------------------------------------

others
hence the alarmmanager which runs much better than a java timertask thingy

alarmmanager should also be more efficient than timertask

alarmmanager consumes lesser battery power than timertask or thread


nltk	stanford-nlp---------------------------------------------------

others
nltk is shy of stanford-nlp in terms of quality of output and for everything other than statistical collocation analysis as far as i can tell stanford-nlp has a broader range of practical algorithms


sqldatareader	sqlconnection---------------------------------------------------

others
once you have this you should be able to have more than one sqldatareader shared on the same sqlconnection in your code and use them independently of one another

the exception may be thrown from the code you are displaying but i would suspect that the cause is because of an sqldatareader associated with the same sqlconnection used earlier in the program execution that has not been disposed


pow	math.h---------------------------------------------------

others
note if we replace math.h by cmath the program does not compile with a warning of ambiguous call to pow seems a better condition


bluej	greenfoot---------------------------------------------------

others
i think greenfoot is better than bluej for 8-years old


wordpress	vbulletin---------------------------------------------------

others
i searched a lot about a tutorial or even a documentation describing how to add custom settings fields to general settings page in vbulletin admin panel but no way unlike the wordpress which is much easier to get tutorials to


chown	umask---------------------------------------------------

others
but changing the chmod maybe even working with umask is better than dealing with root-access and using chown


jar	war---------------------------------------------------

others
if your client jar is really thinner for example only the interfaces having the war s reference the client jar effectively disallows them to access to ejb implementations which is always a good idea

so in my practice using war app easier than jar to manage and re-configure

i set up a maven multi module project one with packaging war two more with packaging jar

you linked to a question about a war vs a jar while spring boot s jar is indeed a jar it contains more than what you usually put inside a jar

while impact in compilation is minimal the impact in deployment can be bad i ve just came across an unused import that required a separate library witch became a maven dependency a further transitive dependency problem was not found hopefully but the war was thicker for no reason add to that a superfluous jar in the webapp classloader

i recently got this error with tomcat 7.0.21 on windows 7 when a war contained jars which had duplicate class definitions a class was defined in more than 1 jar within the war s web-inf lib directory

keeping your business logic in ejb jar will pay off when you ll need more than one war in your ear different security realms etc.

i tried to do it in server s pom.xml file and i set the impl module to provided scope so the jar file is not longer contained in war but now the tests are failing as after unpacking the war file used for running the tests does not contain the impl jar file which is required for that

but including this jar in my war only broke more things


common better files
i have the jersey resource classes bundled within a larger war as jar file which is now residing underneath web-inf lib folder on websphere application server

5 a war file can be runnable executable though this is more common with jar files

is embedded jar better than embedded war file


resources jboss empty
when a jsf resource is found in war instead of jar then those in war will have higher loading precedence over those in jars

like remove the jar s from your war in case the version of your jar is same or lower than that of jboss s or replace the jar s of jboss and remove that jar s from your war in case the version of your jar is higher than that of jboss s

resources in war have higher loading precedence than those in jar

resources in war have higher classloading precedence than those in jar so the empty file would be loaded instead


opengl-es	glkbaseeffect---------------------------------------------------

others
among other things the apple template code will include creation of a glkbaseeffect which provides some shader functionality that seems to be required in order to be able to draw with opengl-es 2.0


rythm	freemarker---------------------------------------------------

others
probably you can take a look at rythm template engine which is much faster than freemarker and velocity also much easier to use


arp	dhcp---------------------------------------------------

others
i would like to simulate multiple dhcp client using dhtest.however the below script is not working as expected.can someone help to fix the problem or provide any script which can simulate dhcp clients and also bind to respond for arp requests


many-to-many	one-to-many---------------------------------------------------

others
using two one-to-many associations is always better than relying on many-to-many relations

iâ ve read a so questionâ s comment where inserting order# 68 as pictured wouldnâ t cause any trouble but if i wanted to query orders by certain tags a many-to-many is more appropriate convenient efficient since otherwise in a one-to-many every single order will have to be checked to know how its tags is this true


opensuse	centos---------------------------------------------------

others
note that centos software versions are older than debian s but versions of opensuse software are newer than debian s versions


wxpython	qt-designer---------------------------------------------------

others
as far as i can tell qt-designer is more powerful than any wxpython counterpart like boa constructor and pyglade


mouseout	mouseenter---------------------------------------------------

others
also instead of mouseover and mouseout use the better ones mouseenter and mouseleave or simply the .hover method


alternative use idea
imho mouseenter and mouseleave are much more reliable than mouseover and mouseout which tend to flicker

it should also be noted that mouseenter and mouseleave work somewhat differently and usually much better than mouseover and mouseout

in this case mouseenter mouseleave has better behaviour and prevents bubbling compared to mouseover mouseout

i have no idea about the classes but i think mouseenter and mouseleave are better alternative for mouseout and mouseover

because jquery doesn t use mouseover and mouseout it uses mouseenter and mouseleave which are more suited to this scenario

also you might want to use mouseenter and mouseleave which are sanitized by jquery and are a little more reliable than mouseover and mouseout

this may make for various race conditions and may necessitate using events which give you earlier notification than mouseup mousedown mouseenter mouseleave mouseover mouseout

some browsers implement the mouseenter mouseleave events that i ve noticed are more accurate than mouseout


argumentnullexception	argumentexception---------------------------------------------------

others
an argumentnullexception would be misleading so argumentexception is a better fit

usually you get something like argumentnullexception or argumentoutofrangeexception which derive from argumentexception and give more explicit detail about what s actually wrong with the argument


bower	jspm---------------------------------------------------

others
well jspm is much larger and ambitious project than bower


ctypes	f2py---------------------------------------------------

others
even without having to deal with linked lists it s quite a hassle but ctypes are vastly more powerful and robust that f2py


lxml	beautifulsoup---------------------------------------------------

robust powerful experienced
i found lxml to be more efficient consistent to use and even robust than beautifulsoup

lxml is significantly more powerful and robust than beautifulsoup in my experienced opinion


others
ian bicking once wrote that surprisingly lxml could be better at parsing soups than beautifulsoup just mentioning for reference haven t tried that personally

lxml also has more features and offers beautifulsoup too

i do understand that traditionally they are saying that lxml are stricter than beautifulsoup however what i do not get is the following

we used beautifulsoup in house for a project and found going to lxml gave us more control over the html parsing we were doing as well as less odd issues

for starters beautifulsoup is no longer actively maintained and the author even recommends alternatives such as lxml


faster better syntax
beautifulsoup is more suitable for html parsing than lxml

it provides similar css selector syntax as jquery does and it s much faster than beautifulsoup because it relies on lxml to do the parsing work

i ve been trying to do this with beautifulsoup though it looks like lxml might work better

one of the things that makes lxml better than beautifulsoup is support for proper css-like class selection or even supports full css selectors if you want to use them

lxml is supposed to be much faster and efficient and can do much more than beautifulsoup

i prefer the beautifulsoup syntax as i find it more natural but i find that lxml is better when i m trying to parse unknown quantities on the fly based on variables-- generating xpath strings that include variable values which i will then use to extract specific elements from varying pages

speed isn t important here but in other applications it is good to know that regexes are very fast 100 times faster than lxml and 1000 faster than beautifulsoup

i prefer to use beautifulsoup better than lxml

lxml is faster than beautifulsoup i think and has much better functionality while remaining relatively easy to use

lxml is much faster than beautifulsoup and probably the fastest parser available for python

note that using the beautifulsoup parser is a lot slower than lxml s default parser

it s generally accepted that lxml is faster than beautifulsoup ref

i ve found that even if lxml is faster than beautifulsoup for documents that size it s usually best to try to reduce the size to a few kb via regex or direct stripping and load that into bs as you are doing now

lxml is also much much faster than beautifulsoup

from reading this website it seems lxml is the most commonly used and fastest while beautifulsoup is slower but accounts for more errors and variation

according to the above posts and my own experience lxml is definitely faster than beautifulsoup

how can i find all div and span tags with order preserved.with beautifulsoup it is very simple but i switched recently to lxml since it is much faster than beautifulsoup

i prefere lxml it s a harder to understand but much faster than beautifulsoup

alternatively you can use lxml module which is lot faster than beautifulsoup

since you re using lxml why not use it in a more direct manner lxml is believed to be faster than beautifulsoup

it uses lxml underneath and is much faster than beautifulsoup

you ll probably find that lxml runs faster than beautifulsoup but in my uses beautifulsoup was very easy to learn and use and handled typical crappy html as found in the wild well enough that i don t have need for anything else

according to some benchmark tests lxml is nearly 100 times faster than beautifulsoup

pyquery is based on lxml so it s also much faster than beautifulsoup

edit don t use this for html work use the lxml library it s python based and much faster than beautifulsoup


easier xpath end
lxml enables you to search for elements using xpath which i think is easier than using beautifulsoup s api

i think beautifulsoup or even bare lxml would be easier

so if you are just starting out beautifulsoup may be easier to use instantly but in the end i believe lxml is more pleasant to work with

i found a solution to this problem using beautifulsoup at beautifulsoup-where-are-you-putting-my-html because i think it is easier than lxml

lxml will let you use xpath here which i think will be less painful than beautifulsoup s interface


broken task html
i would recommend lxml for html parsing it s simple and considerably faster than beautifulsoup can be as much as two orders of magnitude

beautifulsoup is a python package that parses broken html while lxml does so faster but with high quality html xml

it s much much faster than beautifulsoup and it even handles broken html better than beautifulsoup their claim to fame - lxml just isn t as vocal about it

note that lxml is probably a better option than beautifulsoup for this kind of task nowadays for the reasons given by beautifulsoup s author

the reason for using lxml for such a task is that it cleans html files better than beautifulsoup do


coff	omf---------------------------------------------------

others
windows dmd produces omf while coff is more popular now


atoi	strtod---------------------------------------------------

others
also strtod is a better alternative to atoi


respond.js	modernizr---------------------------------------------------

others
first off based on the forums i have been reading you should not include respond.js from modernizr they are more than likely going to drop it


uicollectionview	uitableview---------------------------------------------------

luck better
you might have better luck with a uicollectionview instead of a uitableview

first i thought to use uitableview but i have read that uicollectionview would be better

if you don t want to use it in either a uitableview or a uicollectionview you re probably better of without it


others
on second thoughts in your case uicollectionview is surely a better candidate than uitableview

i also read somewhere that uicollectionview has much better performance in displaying variable-sized content would it be worthwhile possible to try configuring a uicollectionview to display the messages and somehow make it look like a uitableview

a uicollectionview works very similar to a uitableview but gives you more control over how the cells should be displayed and aligned

in fact i m seriously considering replacing all uitableview in my future projects with uicollectionview which are far more adaptable

finally you might want to look into uicollectionview which provides a lot more visual flexibility than uitableview and can be seen as a sort of generalization of the latter

i think it is older than the uicollectionview and therfore explains it for uitableview

you can see uitableview in almost every ios application for example contacts or ipod while uicollectionview are more difficult to see the grid in photos but also the coverflow in ipod

uicollectionview is more generic than uitableview and you can custom almost thing on it

instead of using a uitableview in this instance perhaps you might consider using a uicollectionview - they are built for something like you describe more than a uitableview


junit	mockito---------------------------------------------------

others
i am going to need to use powermockito - mockito to create some more tests but before i start writing those tests i am just switching the junit runner to powermockrunner


highcharts	highstock---------------------------------------------------

others
since most of the functionality of highcharts is found in highstock you re probably better off to just use highstock for whatever application needs the range selector

i have a chart in highcharts to be more specific it s a highstock chart candlesticks type and now i want to add some svg shapes to it

in other cases i ve gotten an error that says highcharts was loaded more than once but i m not using highstock which is apparently the source of this error


decltype	auto---------------------------------------------------

others
decltype is significantly more versatile that auto and can always be used in place of it

in the cases where auto can be used it is more concise than decltype as you don t need to provide the expression from which the type will be inferred

you could of course just wrap the function in a decltype to figure out the return but an auto is much cleaner to write


relaxng	schematron---------------------------------------------------

others
other options to check are relaxng which is more flexible and powerful than xml schema or schematron which allows for exactly this sort of validation that needs to go deeper than structure and simple type-checks


camping	ruby-on-rails---------------------------------------------------

others
i would like to use a lighter framework than ruby-on-rails sinatra ramaze camping but am concerned that by doing so i will not be able to use a lot of shared libraries that have been tailored to ruby-on-rails in the form of plugins


libcurl	httr---------------------------------------------------

others
however httr would be a better choice since it and the libcurl package it uses deal with web server interaction and content in a more thorough way


d3.js	chart.js---------------------------------------------------

others
also i started this out in d3.js and was thinking chart.js might be faster

d3.js has a steeper learning curve than chart.js but once you get the hang of it you can do pretty much anything graph related with it.official site is here


splinter	selenium---------------------------------------------------

others
consider taking a look at splinter which is a simpler webdriver api than selenium

if you do move forward with selenium though it might be worth to take a look at splinter which is an abstraction layer on top of selenium making it easier to write tests


simpler easier
splinter makes it easier to use selenium plus

splinter simpler than selenium


toolbar	tabs---------------------------------------------------

others
i am trying to implements ads on the bottom of my screen someone told me i have to change the linearlayout to relativelayout but when i do that my toolbar somehow become smaller and the tabs begin to look strange.so i think there might be some things i need to change or add to the relativelayout that i do not know here is my linearlayout down here

however the tabs get a darker shade of orange while the toolbar doesn t

search to each tabs in more than one toolbar


chameleon	jinja2---------------------------------------------------

others
template engines are rarely the cause of performance problems even if chameleon is slightly faster than jinja2 i doubt the effort of learning a new template language etc


system.data.oracleclient	odp.net---------------------------------------------------

others
agreed that using odp.net is better than deprecated system.data.oracleclient


qiodevice	qdatastream---------------------------------------------------

others
instead of using the endian conversion functions you could use the qdatastream functionality with any qiodevice which is much easier and more intuitive in my opinion


uisegmentedcontrol	uitabbarcontroller---------------------------------------------------

others
if you want a different look than what is provided by the uisegmentedcontrol using the uitabbarcontroller is the better option


focuslistener	documentlistener---------------------------------------------------

others
create the text field and register the documentlistener to it...although i d be wary about using a documentlistener personally maybe a actionlistener and or focuslistener might be more suitable but hay


crossfilter	reductio---------------------------------------------------

others
i think reductio will make this easier but with raw crossfilter this would look something like


glut	glew---------------------------------------------------

others
if you are a noob then i don t think that starting with mesa running on any kind of vm is a good idea.mesa setup is pretty complex in general.also mesa opengl is outdated.it supports up to 3.2 version atm.if you want to get started with opengl the right and clean way you should better setup context with libs like glut or glfw and load gl extension with glew there are more


median	minimum---------------------------------------------------

others
i want to repeatedly rearrange an array or std vector so that the minimum is the first element the maximum is the last element and would be the median elements before the median is less than median elements after the median would be greater

if the number is higher than the median the median is the new minimum

there are at least n m+1 2 elements no larger than the maximum hi of these median and at least n m+1 2 no smaller than the minimum lo

but i can only see 5 possible values not 7 or is there more than minimum q1 q2 median q3 maximum to a boxplot


ocaml	prolog---------------------------------------------------

others
haskell ml ocaml miranda alice oz erlang twelf coq prolog all demonstrate more rigorous applications of mathematics to programming


ienumerable	ilist---------------------------------------------------

better good iqueryable
compared to ienumerable and icollection ilist performs much better for large or dynamic lists because it provides an indexer allowing us quick random access

generally ienumerable and iqueryable are even better than ilist as they re more generic unless you want to limit this with good reason of course


abstract possible collections
ienumerable is more abstract and is generally preferred to list or ilist if possible

another suggestion change you to because you can keep an extension method for more collections because the ienumerable is more abstract than ilist


others
the reason why this doesn t work specifically is because ilist is more specialized than ienumerable

ilist is stronger in that it makes more guarantees than ienumerable

an ienumerable is less specific than an ilist

basically the methods will range from a base of ienumerable all the way up to ilist which has a larger selection available

ienumerable is less specific than ilist ilist implements ienumerable so unless you want something specific from ilist such as .count as you suggest or perhaps add delete etc i d use ienumerable

thus ilist is more than ienumerable and you won t be able to get away with it

yes i understand that ienumerable is much more lighter rather than ilist but anyway there is a lot situations where we need to have ilist instead of ienumerable and in this approach we need to cast ienumerable to ilist isn t it


functionality nhibernate interface
you need to use tolist to convert it from ienumerable because the ilist interface supports more functionality than the ienumerable interface

another thing that bothers me is why in nhibernate always it is being used ilist and not ienumerable which has less functionality


specific functions
ienumerable is less specific than ilist

ienumerable is less specific than an ilist that is ilist has functions that ienumerable does not


ant	pom.xml---------------------------------------------------

others
it has some downsides- namely working with both ant and maven so the actual pom.xml is more difficult to comprehend but it does allow for more flexibility than is otherwise possible with maven

but even when your project s pom.xml files become more substantial they hold an entirely different kind of information from the build file of a similarly sized project using ant

it will depend on the complexity of your builds if you have basic java builds then maven might be more suited as the pom.xml files maven build filds are pretty simple but if you need to do a lot of custom specific stuff you may well end up having ant scripts to perform also if you already have one system in place there isnt necessarily a huge advantage of swapping


asterisk	ivr---------------------------------------------------

others
microsoft has the microsoft speech api sapi however if you want simple ivr it is better not to reinvent the wheel and customize an asterisk implementation which i guess falls under the great ivr library for c++ category it s c not c++ but if you know c++ you should be able to understand the c . using asterisknow you may not even need to write any custom code it may do what you want already


java.util.calendar	java.util.date---------------------------------------------------

others
construct java.util.calendar is comparative slower than java.util.date

additionally using java.util.date is not good practice at all since most of its method are deprecated so i suggest you to use java.util.calendar which is more flexible


super	abstract---------------------------------------------------

others
i could just throw away customsetup and put all the custom code after super but having that abstract method makes clearer what you re supposed to put there


concave	convex---------------------------------------------------

others
the exact algorithm you choose will depend on a combination of how fast you need it to run and what kinds of shapes you want to support convex are the easiest concave is harder shapes with holes are harder too

the check for convex polygons your triangle is simpler than for concave ones see first linked article

but determining a concave hull is far more difficult than a convex hull


cufft	fftw---------------------------------------------------

others
i am working on a code which needs to be time efficient and thus using cufft for this purpose but when i try to compute fft of a very large data in parallel it is slower than cpu fftw and the reason i find after finding the time for every line of code using high precision timing code is that cudamalloc taking around 0.983 sec while the time for rest of the lines of code is around 0.00xx sec which is expected ..


experiments discussion openmp
however for a variety of fft problem sizes i ve found that cufft is slower than fftw with openmp

in the experiments and discussion below i find that cufft is slower than fftw for batched 2d ffts


symfony	kohana---------------------------------------------------

others
i would go with kohana over symfony because kohana is much easier to understand out of the box and doesn t require any special setup to work with

i would use xpath with simplexml or domdocument depending on my needs although kohana might offer something better like zend does with zend_dom_query or symfony does with sfwebbrowser both of which let you use a querys similar to jquery s css selectors

the documentation sucks but it s very lightweight there s a good community even on so it s more simple than symfony and more powerful than codeigniter the first version of kohana was based on codeigniter

of the big ones codeigniter kohana zend cake symfony i think the newer zend has the best support for restful webservices but earlier versions of zend framework had woefully lacking rest controllers


bazaar	perforce---------------------------------------------------

others
you may also want to take a look at why git is better than x a site that attempts to convince you of the superiority of git over mercurial bazaar subversion and perforce


thunk	trampolines---------------------------------------------------

others
trampolines never runs more than one thunk at a time so if you break


fgetc	getline---------------------------------------------------

others

debug âµs version
the fact that using getline with iostreams is faster than fgetc at least in release mode runs counter to the reasoning that copying all that data must be slower than not copying it so i m not sure what all optimization is able to avoid and i didn t really look to find any explanation but it d be interesting to understand what s being optimized away

i confirmed that in debug mode the getline version is slower about 130 âµs vs 60 âµs for the fgetc version


fasttext	word2vec---------------------------------------------------

others
fasttext is not better than word2vec as for as semantic similarity is concerned

1 is possible then will word2vec be more efficient in text-based plagiarism detection than wordnet or any other word embeddings like glove fasttext etc


leaflet	openlayers---------------------------------------------------

others
webmap toolkit leaflet became popular and easy to use while openlayers is more powerful

while leaflet aims to be more lightweight than openlayers openlayers is by far the more mature proj


ienumerable	icollection---------------------------------------------------

others
even though this is not quite related to the question since google brings you here i thought it might be helpful to notice that a likely possibility is that your are using ienumerable for you collection you should be using icollection see more here

the second way i thought is testing for icollection instead of ienumerable since ienumerable is more of a potential collection than an actual one

icollection also seems like a valid candidate due to its name but i get the impression ienumerable are more user friendly


better simple else
a better way to do that instead is taking in an ienumerable which is more generic than icollection since icollection implements ienumerable and simply checking it for null and else returning any from linq s operators

secondly i did not use ienumerable because it is more generic than icollection and does not even have simple properties like count


erd	entity-relationship---------------------------------------------------

others
first entity-relationship modeling is more than just an erd


fgets	realloc---------------------------------------------------

others
if you re not on a sufficiently posix-ish platform then you ll need to use fgets with checking to find whether you actually read a whole line â using realloc to allocate more space if your initial line isn t long enough

whether you use realloc or a linked list of buffers it comes down to reading usually through fgets reading some more and so on until the buffer you ve just read contains a n


bundler	bcrypt-ruby---------------------------------------------------

others
if the bundler is newer then version 1.1.2 it will remove bcrypt-ruby 3.0.1-x86-mingw32 automaticaly


i2c	spi---------------------------------------------------

control last bus
i have done some research about them and it seems to be that spi is faster than i2c but the last one ensures more control and error detection over the first one

on top of that the i2c bus is slower than spi because there are control data exchanged


etc uart solution
i know i2c is more complex slow than spi uart etc. but it s a constrain

communication via i2c is more complex that with uart or spi solution


others
post explaining why spi is faster than i2c

first bit banging i2c is way more complicated than bit banging spi

i wanted to know that what makes spi faster than i2c

how is spi better than i2c at these temperatures

spi is not less limited than i2c in this case


kohana	yii---------------------------------------------------

others
depends i came from php4 and didn t really touch the level of oop needed for the php5 kohana framework i ve used classes and functions but the hmvc is a process on it s own to learn when it comes to kohana vs yii i d have to say kohana is easier to pickup


komodo	gedit---------------------------------------------------

others
when i m in a hurry i use gedit purely because it is quicker than komodo edit


packery	masonry---------------------------------------------------

others
for my project packery is better then masonry because packery is filling up all gaps masonry is just looking for the first possible gap and doesn t fill empty gaps


ogre	irrlicht---------------------------------------------------

others
irrlicht has a cleaner api lower system requirements and works better across platforms than ogre in my opinion

i then exported the recognized camera-parameters and transformed them to fit the matrix s used by the irrlich-engine i also tried ogre but irrlicht seemed nicer to me and then rendered my object with it onto the image

irrlicht is no way better than ogre 3d or am not trying to prove that


cmmotionmanager	uiaccelerometer---------------------------------------------------

others
basically it seems like cmmotionmanager is much larger and slower than uiaccelerometer is


email-ext	jenkins---------------------------------------------------

others
you could also use a jenkins plugin email-ext to perform more advanced tasks


fgets	strtol---------------------------------------------------

others
also your get_int would be better written with fgets or getline if available and strtol


org.json	gson---------------------------------------------------

others
well sometimes performance and usability can be at odds but i ve found gson to be easier to use than alternatives like jackson org.json and others

for encoding data in json yes gson is a good approach but i think that org.json would be more easy to use


slower better jackson
org.json jackson and gson with gson being 10x slower

quick takeaway of the benchmark jackson performs 5 to 6 times better than org.json and more than twice better than gson

or switch from org.json to something that performs better such as gson or jackson


javassist	cglib---------------------------------------------------

others
here in so i found a lot of questions asking something similar and the answers normally said you can use cglib or asm or javassist is better than cglib or bcel is old and is dying or asm is the best because it gives x and y

also javassist is recognized to be slower than cglib

this makes for example javassist or proxetta significantly slower than cglib which simply reads the methods via the reflection api and overrides them

the javadoc of javassist is way better than that of cglib

note that javassist is significantly slower then for example cglib because it reads in class files directly instead of using reflective access in order to avoid class loading


strncpy	malloc---------------------------------------------------

others
in addition to the previous answers the strncpy char pointer which seems unsafe for my opinion and the malloc which is safer but you need to remember to free it outside of the function and its inconsistent with the hierarchy of the program you can do the following


uipangesturerecognizer	catransition---------------------------------------------------

others
if you want to use a continuous gesture that tracks the user s finger you can use uipangesturerecognizer rather than uiswipegesturerecognizer and i think animatewithduration is better than catransition in that case


bison	jison---------------------------------------------------

others
indeed it would be relatively easy to preprocess a bison grammar file but it is easier with jison because you can compute the grammar programmatically and pass it to jison as a json object


imageview	fresco---------------------------------------------------

others
the fresco docs explain how to use drawees and you can see right from their xml definition that they are much more customizable than imageview


wmv	flv---------------------------------------------------

others
i found the production of wmv much better and easier than flv because all windows flv encoders i tried are not really good and stable whereas pretty much every tool can natively output wmv


cakephp	zend-framework---------------------------------------------------

others
since cakephp seems to be much lighter than zend-framework i would suggest that you take a look at cakephp


domcontentloaded	addeventlistener---------------------------------------------------

others
a more superior way is to call addeventlistener in javascript itself on the event domcontentloaded here are more informations


guard	autotest---------------------------------------------------

others
i recently moved from autotest to guard for a reason it works better than autotest and it has a lot of available guard

in other words guard is more a generic framework for every process which needs to do something triggered by a file change autotest is restricted to running tests


sproutcore	javascriptmvc---------------------------------------------------

others
i know sproutcore is backed by apple and looks like it is getting more popular by the day and it has a nice green website whereas javascriptmvc looks less professional with less of a following and less momentum behind it

it s probably overkill for what you need but sproutcore is an mvc framework and it doesn t look any more heavyweight than javascriptmvc or trimpath s junction


x-tag	polymer---------------------------------------------------

others
x-tag 2 is now using the polymer polyfills so it may not be much better than polymer but worth considering


ecj	javac---------------------------------------------------

others
eclipse compiler for java jdt ecj is much smarter tool than actual javac

however i think that ecj is even better than javac my opinion .

to recap i want to know why a javac compilation utilizes so much more cpu than ecj


orchestration	microservices---------------------------------------------------

others
if you want to have content synchronized between all the microservices in your case the header and footer i d suggest zookeeper it s designed for distributed orchestration and has more of a push model - you d update the header in zookeeper and all of your services would receive that update almost instantly


sortedlist	sorteddictionary---------------------------------------------------

memory
sortedlist tkey tvalue uses less memory than sorteddictionary tkey

â sortedlist uses less memory than sorteddictionary

sortedlist uses less memory than sorteddictionary


others
note if you are constantly adding removing items from existingholdings then you could use sorteddictionary which should be faster sortedlist is faster for accessing elements but takes longer adding removing

you should also keep in mind that sortedlist performs worse than sorteddictionary during construction if the items are not inserted in already-sorted order although in this particular case it is highly likely that dates are inserted in chronological sorted order which would be perfect

ignoring the cost of providing sorted input the oh of sortedlist is smaller than the oh of sorteddictionary

i had one further issue that related to the oncollectionchanged - the notifycollectionchangedeventargs required an index as opposed to the item of the sorteddictionary which is doesn t come out of the box it s easier with a sortedlist but anyhow

seems the sorteddictionary might be your best bet as searching goes but since you want to search by multiple attributes this drops so if you want a good balance between searching and inserting for that large amount of data maybe a sortedlist will yield better results at the cost of memory usage

sortedlist appears to use less memory and is technically a binary tree where sorteddictionary is faster with unsorted data


purpose offers class
for your purpose you would probably be better off with a sorteddictionary class or perhaps sortedlist

sorteddictionary offers same advantages than sortedlist but performs better if values to insert are not already sorted


removal insertion operations
sorteddictionary has faster insertion and removal operations for unsorted data o log n as opposed to o n for sortedlist

note after doing some benchmarks i found that sorteddictionary is faster for removal but sortedlist is faster for adding and indexing by key

as zmbq mentioned in his comment to marc s question the sortedlist is implemented as an array so if faster insertion removal times are needed then the sorteddictionary would be a better choice

sorteddictionary has faster insertion and removal operations for unsorted data o logn as opposed to o n for sortedlist


faster middle
if the sortedlist is populated all at once from sorted data it s faster than sorteddictionary

if the list is populated all at once from sorted data sortedlist is faster than sorteddictionary

sortedlist is faster when you want to enumerate the elements and you can access the elements by index and sorteddictionary is faster if there are a lot of elements and you want to insert a new element in the middle of the collection

sortedlist is faster than sorteddictionary


jdom	xerces---------------------------------------------------

others
other alternatives such as xerces xmlserializer or jdom xmloutputter are more direct methods less code but they are framework-specific


agda	idris---------------------------------------------------

others
i d recommend agda as the better vehicle for getting to grips with the ideas behind dependently typed programming but idris is the more practical option


mouseleave	mouseenter---------------------------------------------------

others
lastly the hover creates two events of which the mouseleave isn t needed for your code so you can use just mouseenter to make it more efficient

mouseleave div becomes thicker which will cause an almost automatic mouseenter


lzo	snappy---------------------------------------------------

others
in my tests snappy performs better than lzo by the way

these formats allow various data compression codecs note that snappy is now much more popular than lzo and can also provide other benefits such as fast serializable deserialization column pruning and bundled metadata


files big decompression
snappy is also significantly faster than lzo for decompression

snappy also consistently decompresses 20 + faster than lzo which is a pretty big win if you want it for files you re reading a lot over hadoop


filesystems	ntfs---------------------------------------------------

better fat simple
it s not too hard for the fat filesystems as it s quite simple and well documented but it s more difficult for ntfs as the filesystems is much more complicated and not-so-well documented

generally the performance of hard filesystems like ntfs is better than that of traditional unix filesystems


others
it won t work on linux but then linux filesystems are less likely to need defragging than ntfs

actual mounting of filesystems is trickier business and really depends on what you are mounting - ntfs fat ext3 xfs nfs cifs webdav etc etc

the problem is that windows ntfs is slower than typical linux filesystems for these lookups

when people say that unix filesystems are better they might mean to be saying oh ext3 stores bits in such as way that corruption happens way less than ntfs but they might also be talking about design choices made at the common layer above

if you need to load from a well-defined filesystems fat or ntfs this is more tricky you have only 450 bytes of space because 60 of the 512 bytes are used by the filesystems internally for code that interprets the data of the filesystems finds the file containing the code and loads it into memory

ntfs is much more complex and time consuming due to the more complex nature of this filesystems

although i myself have prior experience in implementing filesystems much simpler ones than ntfs xfs or ext2 i would not tackle this job

when ms switched to the fat32 filesystems that used longer names and later to the ntfs this created migration issues


nss	gnutls---------------------------------------------------

others
nss is more strict than either openssl or gnutls


multiplying	subtraction---------------------------------------------------

others

numeric addition digit
since multiplication has a higher precedence than subtraction you should subtract 0 to your digit character before multiplying it

either way your example with the numeric expression would multiplying by 3 first because multiplication has higher precedence than addition or subtraction


mpmath	sympy---------------------------------------------------

others
i know sympy has its own plotting module but the one in mpmath seems easier to use so far with the exception of this one issue of course


textview	imageview---------------------------------------------------

drive tel taller
however the imageview has a smaller width than the textview

i tried constraints spacing each imageview with xdp it is ok if all textview are not higher than the imageview but if a textview is higher than a imageview it will overlap

assuming the imageview is always bigger than the textview it ll drive the parent height

i also tried to do spacing from imageview to textview but then if the textview is smaller than the imageview the spacing will be wrong again

i have a button that is bottom constrained to the bottom of the imageview however should be top constrained to the bottom of the subtitle textview if subtitletextview is taller than imageview

i have a larger view with a textview and an imageview inside of it

for api 18 and earlier the margin is being applied after the alignment so if the margin in the imageview is greater than 0 you will get your textview moved

in the image the square represents a fixed size imageview the rectangle is a textview which can 1 line smaller height than imageview or multiline height is larger than imageview

i try to align my imageview and my textview but the imageview is higher than my textview

this should work as long as the imageview is larger than the textview in all dimensions

i have an imageview that is bigger than a textview and i want to center the textview on top of the imageview both vertically and horizontally

i have tried to put my imageview in a linearlayout and put a weight on it but if my imageview is smaller i have a blank between the imageview and the textview

i got the middle textview to fill up what s left and some extra - leaving the left imageview to be smaller than the 40dip i ve set it to be

make textview lower than imageview

the imageview should be closer to left margin and the textview with tel should be closer to image

if the textview might be bigger make sure to center the imageview as well

textview have higher z order than imageview


drawable compound drawables
a linearlayout which contains an imageview and a textview can be more

a linearlayout which contains an imageview and a textview can be more efficiently handled as a compound drawable

but the android guide says use compound drawables - a linearlayout which contains an imageview and a textview can be more efficiently handled as a compound drawable

use compound drawables - a linearlayout which contains an imageview and a textview can be more efficiently handled as a compound drawable


others
double edit so what was happening is that your layout_alignbottom in the linktitle textview was shorter than the height of two lines of text therefore it was cropping the title to limit the height of the textview to that of the favicon imageview

i want to have another textview underneath these two but i am having a problem when the textview length is less than the imageview

add layout_weight properties to sub views as well.assign 3 to imaveview and 1 for textview now imageview always will be bigger than textview 3times and textview can not invade imagevies s space

in this case if textview is higher then imageview imageview aspect ratio should be intact with max width possible and if imageview i higher then textview again width should be maximal and parent should have height as imageview

how could i make the imageview have more priority than textview

all 3 states are much more than an imageview + textview so i went for 3 different layouts for every state and only 1 of them is visible at a time

but i don t know how to align the imageview and the textview to be easier to hide show just the imageview when needed

in your sample xml add two more fields one filepathurl textview second add one more textview with text playvideo and setvisibility to gone and set the visibility of files imageview to gone

when the textview text is longer than cardview length it shows against the imageview and i don t want that


saucelabs	browserstack---------------------------------------------------

others

better cheaper manual
i ve been looking at services and the two most comparable for grid testing look to be saucelabs as mentioned above and also browserstack which offers a cheaper unlimited package i believe

edit i just came across saucelabs which seems to be even better than browserstack for manual testing and they also cover many web browsers tablet mobile devices


scrypt	salt---------------------------------------------------

others
the simplest form of this is to add a salt to the user s passphrase and then feed it into sha-2 to get a 256-bit hash but ideally you want to use something like scrypt to make it harder to brute-force the passphrase

as a side note from what i ve read key derivation functions pbkdf2 scrypt bcrypt are considered better more secure #1 #2 than plain salt sha-1 sha-2 hash by crypto people


seaborn	matplotlib---------------------------------------------------

others
for heatmap and correlation statistical analysis based plot i have had more luck with seaborn than with matplotlib

seaborn is a higher level library above matplotlib

you can import seaborn to get the pretty layout and plot using matplotlib to get easier better config tools


squash	branch---------------------------------------------------

others
i see ones i merge master to feature branch i can not squash he commits any more using interactive rebase

if you really need to be the only one to whom your work-in-progress history is visible you could create a local branch pointed at the head of your local work-in-progress to preserve a named reference to the commit and then perform a squash merge git merge --squash which will still create a merge commit but will collapse your work-in-progress commits down to a single commit the local branch you created earlier will still point to the true detailed history however

if you will have only yours commits on your branch issue is much simpler you can do squash those git squash


pivot-table	crosstab---------------------------------------------------

others
use crosstab for the pivot-table to make that faster yet


gif	ico---------------------------------------------------

others
gif favicons are sometimes used so that they can be animated but ico s have wider browser support

jpg jpeg bmp png webp gif svg js map ico css less scss


centos	solaris---------------------------------------------------

others
and i do as much work as possible on our linux centos 5 system simply because the tools on it are still newer than anything i can find readily packaged for aix solaris is somewhat better

i would give you more info except a ip aliasing on centos 7 is more involved than i like much easier on solaris and b i m not familiar at all with configuring nginx very easy on apache


strstr	strcmp---------------------------------------------------

others
also using strstr instead of strcmp might produce better results


ioexception	filewriter---------------------------------------------------

others
for example public static void copy reader r writer w throws ioexception is more useful reusable than public static void copy filereader r filewriter w throws ioexception


pdfminer	pdfrw---------------------------------------------------

others
if you really want to deeply examine text pdf files pdfminer might be more useful -- pdfrw has not yet really grown the tools to do that too well


iboutlet	ibaction---------------------------------------------------

others
something like enterbutton for the iboutlet and enterpressed for the ibaction would be more appropriate and prevent confusion or a naming conflict


sorting	filtering---------------------------------------------------

others
filtering is a lot less expensive than sorting

sorting in java is a little bit more work than in sql on the other hand filtering is more versatile when implemented in java

filtering indexing sorting all is simpler that way

these kinds of tricks can be applied to modify user-driven sorting and sectioning but for filtering you re better off using a predicate on nsfetchrequest which filtering on actual model data

but the least filtering i apply the more sorting is glitching up to the point of being complete broken

note this won t be sorting sorting by age it should be exactly a filtering having values less or equal to 18 and older than 18 -- a drop down list or radio buttons

on the other hand you may want stable sorting in other contexts as well and so if you have the stable_sort function defined this approach would still be more straightforward than filtering out the numbers with each sign and recombining them

or taking a leaf out of friedi s book taking advantage of sorting the array first but using reduce instead of filtering which is slightly simpler because it means we do not need a iife to close around a previous item

you can filtering by adding pagination conditions but sorting is more complicated seeing as photos can have multiple categories

if your author field is selective and sorting is cheaper than filtering

the reason of the choice local sorting paging and filtering will be typically more quickly as the round-trip to the server

datatables allows you to add sorting paging filtering limiting and more to any html table

considering sorting is more complicated than summation median filtering will cost longer time

but right now the sorting step is taking way longer than the filtering step so i would like to combine them in some way

but if the collection isnâ t sorted a simple linear search is more efficient than sorting just for a single use of binary search not to speak of the fact that binary search works with list s only while filtering findany works with any stream supporting every kind of source collection

i thought i can use _score for sorting and give more relevance to people who are under 1000 km but geo-distance is a filtering i don t seem to find any way to give relevance in filtering


slower thousands query
you d still have to filtering to get a range though it ought to be faster than sorting at least

in terms of your speed query i d propose that your pseudomedian filtering is faster because it doesn t involve sorting

if almost all elements fail the filtering then it s considerably slower than just sorting everything since you ll end up selecting thousands of times


data milliseconds smaller
the filtering on about 10 000 rows of data and sorting all happens in less than 50 milliseconds

sorting all the objects before filtering is sure to take longer than filtering and then sorting a smaller data set


codeigniter	pyrocms---------------------------------------------------

others
unless you re writing trivial apps or just like re-writing code i wouldn t start any new project in codeigniter because pyrocms is the more sensible starting point

the more i look into pyrocms the more i feel like it s codeigniter made easier


persistent	transient---------------------------------------------------

others
my intuition is that transient properties would incurr less overhead than persistent properties because they do not need to be persistent and read from the database so converting them to persistent properties will likely only make things slightly worse

first i have a transient property called sectionidentifier .this could be now next and past depend on the current time.i added a new persistent property next to this transient called sectionid

memcache data lives in memory and isn t persistent so is for more transient data


strdup	malloc---------------------------------------------------

simpler convenient identical
you can use either to create a new memory block which is separate from the original but naturally strdup is simpler since it doesn t require a separate malloc strlen call

because of the above replace strdup with strlen malloc memcpy memcpy is slightly faster than strcpy

additionally if you have strdup then it is much more convenient than strlen + malloc + strcpy with identical result including the same obligation to free the allocated storage when you no longer need it


others
i ve never used malloc to store more than values but i have to use strdup to order the lines of an input file and i dont get a way to make it work

he cried. will save the string on the static storage and you will not be able to do most of the function on them you better work with strdup in your function or malloc and calloc to be able to use all the function


memory free programmer
you should know that strdup allocates more memory and returns its pointer which you then overwrite the original pointer returned by malloc so it will be impossible to free that memory since you no longer have the pointers

in c memory most other things are managed by the programmer so strdup is no worse than forgetting to free malloc ed memory failing to null terminate a string using incorrect format string in scanf and invoking undefined behaviour accessing dangling pointer etc


willing cleaner posix
or indeed if your system has strdup or you re willing to write an implementation then strdup is much cleaner than malloc + strcpy

as i noted in comments however if you re willing to rely on posix s strdup then that s cleaner than strlen + malloc + and has the same semantics you take responsibility for freeing the memory allocated for the copy


memcmp	strcmp---------------------------------------------------

others
rest assured though that strcmp is better equipped in the general case for string comparisons than memcmp is

note also the functions strncmp and memcmp which are similar to strcmp but are safer


simpler faster parts
memcmp is simpler than strcmp and can be implemented even more efficiently in places where the strings are known to be properly aligned

strcmp also works but memcmp is cleaner if you are comparing parts of two arrays together as my ip value had an octet stored in different indexes so i could easily just use the size 4 to cover 0 to 3 indexes

if you always keep track of the lengths of your strings you can compare lengths and use memcmp which is faster than strcmp


mantis	bugzilla---------------------------------------------------

others
since mantis is a bit more complete than bugzilla when it comes to features you could define separate issues with custom field for your tasks

research showed me that mantis is simpler to use over bugzilla so i decided to use mantis but have no idea how to install it.can anyone please tell me what are the steps you need to take in order to install mantis bug tracking system in a small company to track website mobile portal bugs


square-root	palindrome---------------------------------------------------

others
the mathematical reason for this is that once the solution 906609 is found it will no longer be possible to find a larger palindrome where the larger factor is less than the square-root of 906609 which is 952.160.


erlang	elixir---------------------------------------------------

others
erlang has a steeper learning curve compared to elixir

i agree some mechanisms in elixir are slightly more verbose than erlang function definitions being my personal pet peeve and vice-versa

i mean i could just write microservices with elixir and use them as if they were written in any other language polyglotism is one of the benefits of microservices anyway but then i m not getting the full benefits of using the otp platform i guess that pure collaborative erlang applications are way more optimal that using intermediate queues to communicate between microservices written in different or not languages


free	strncpy---------------------------------------------------

others
in addition to the previous answers the strncpy char pointer which seems unsafe for my opinion and the malloc which is safer but you need to remember to free it outside of the function and its inconsistent with the hierarchy of the program you can do the following


onclick	onchange---------------------------------------------------

others
checkbox onchange should be more meaningful than onclick

maybe using the event onchange instead of onclick would be more elegant


note better respond
here s something that should get you started - this is all based on the assumption that there are only 3 checkboxes on your whole page and that you re interested in all of them - you ll want to make a method like this respond to your checkbox elements onclick events - i ve found that to be more reliable than onchange

note that onclick is better supported with checkbox and radio button than is onchange


lisp	scheme---------------------------------------------------

tool different closer
if you decide to use a language that s larger and messier than scheme try common lisp

i ve noticed that the common lisp approach is more conservative than the approach scheme has

scheme is intentionally more compact than common lisp and you ll find that you can learn the language very quickly

scheme is older than common lisp

that said it is a scheme which has fewer batteries included as compared to common lisp

i ve also found scheme ides much more user-friendly than lisp s plt scheme is a good one

because they use a different non-scheme language scheme macros are less powerful than common lisp macros in the almost-formal sense you can do arbitrary compile-time computation with them but it s hairy and convoluted

racket is closer to scheme than to common lisp but you could dip your toes into the lisp family without the speed bump of the emacs style of development

scheme has fewer libraries than common lisp

it s popular it s actively developed it has many libraries offering the features of a modern programming environment and scheme is somewhat simpler not to say better just simpler than common lisp

if you want to learn lisp paip is a better choice to start with because it will teach you a lot about common lisp and a smallish chunk of scheme

common lisp of course scheme might be an easier introduction though and easier to get a stable simple common environment

i noted that while in languages like c variable identifiers can only be alphanumberics and underscores common lisp allows many more characters to be used like and at least scheme does

common lisp has a separate namespace for functions which makes operation like this more verbose than with scheme

scheme is also a good language for that purpose and it is simpler smaller than lisp

common lisp is a weakly functional mixed-paradigm language and scheme is more strongly functional but still not pure

however gambit scheme has smoother access to c c++ code libraries which far outnumber common lisp s libraries

do racket macros have more advanced functionality than those found in scheme or common lisp

if you are even older and grew up with scheme or are younger and have read the common lisp hyperspec then you might want to write

i suggest that you start with scheme and then move on to common lisp as scheme is simpler

here is a solution in scheme because i know that better than common lisp and have an interpreter for checking my work

i personally believe that it is not worth the effort because basic is a nearly dead language and there are lots of languages better than basic ocaml haskell common lisp clojure scala scheme go d ...

this is of course subjective but i think learning common lisp or standard scheme is generally more useful just for the simple fact that you then will not be limited to one compiler

for sure it s a complication that makes it harder to explain the language to whoever is learning it and that s why scheme is considered a better simpler language for teaching but many expert lispers think that it s a good choice that makes the lisp language a better tool for real problems

i don t see why sbcl should be so fast - scheme is a far simpler language than common lisp

overall common lisp is much more uniform than scheme and more radical language experiments if done at all are usually embedded as a portable library rather than defining a whole new language dialect


others
but honestly all the useful macros i ve defined are stolen from paul graham s on lisp and are generally easier to write with defmacro define-macro in plt scheme

t s purpose is to test the thesis developed by steele and sussman in their series of papers about scheme that scheme may be used as the basis for a practical programming language of exceptional expressive power and that implementations of scheme could perform better than other lisp systems and competitively with implementations of programming languages such as c and bliss which are usually considered to be inherently more efficient than lisp on conventional machine architectures

the class uses scheme a dialect of lisp which is significantly cleaner and easier to use than common lisp yes this is an opinion deal with it

that s the best argument i ve seen for scheme macros over common lisp ones if you are building a complex language on top of scheme you are less likely to introduce subtle macro bugs if you stick with the standard macro system

most lisp dialects have this concepts in scheme it is rarer since hygienic macros are supposed to reduce its usefulness

for a counterexample i think scheme programs ran faster and used less memory than the lisp programs that preceded them mdash

my impression common lisp is more for getting stuff done scheme is more for education and fun

i imagine scheme and perhaps lisp could be made more user friendly by using a different syntax

well scheme has a single lexical environment but older lisp can have more than one lexical environment

i think architecture with sockets was chosen for better portability between different lisp btw slime also supports clojure and mit scheme and os-es slime works on windows too

both because of the image-based interactive development and because of the larger language lisp implementations are usually less portable across operating systems than scheme implementations are


systems pattern system
is it possible however to implement common lisp s macro system in scheme which is more powerful than syntax-rules using syntax-case

i suspect that the reason people write scheme style macro systems in common lisp is more for the pattern matching than for the hygiene


metaspace	permgen---------------------------------------------------

others
in java-8 permgen was replaced with metaspace which is more flexible in terms of memory usage so you rarely need to tune its size explicitly


range	max---------------------------------------------------

min int wrap
if you want to check that a number is between the min and max of the range you would likely want to check that it is both higher than the min and lower than the max

an automatically adjusted range will always be the next power of 10 greater than max value

your value 6131231234 is greater than int max value 6131231234 is not accommodated into int range which results into exception

the question i have is i would like the calendar to only display the min and max date range for the from date and to date any thing greater than the max and anything less than the min should be greyed out

produces the same error attributeerror max must be larger than min in range parameter

it may look odd but it is common for number-to-string functions in many programming languages to make an exception for the min value in this way because with two s complement representation of integers the max value is 1 less than the absolute of the min value range of -2 147 483 648 to +2 147 483 647 which means the min value is the only negative value you can t flip to positive and then process using the same shared loop code as for the positive values.

i would like to know if there is a way to access the range of said shader properties so that i can set a max and min value to my sliders

however i m getting a attributeerror max must be larger than min in range parameter. error when i m trying to plot the normalized data

but with this the last range is larger than the max value

retrieve the unique range whose max value is greater than an ip

and during sometime i have a range where min and max is less than 1 and greater than 0

if range is greater then or less then the min and max then it should throw error

ie the range includes min but excludes max and values greater than max or less than min wrap around in a circle

keep in mind that the cast int d will not throw an exception if the value of d is outside the range of an int - if which is greater than the max value of an int the resultant cast will be -2147483648

a larger range means a greater max value and a smaller min value than decimal

the max value of a range must be greater than or equal to the min

avoiding variables and functions cross join the table against some other table s to generate a range of rows where the range is greater than the max value of quantity

but continuing i always got attributeerror max must be larger than min in range parameter

in general you want to have a range slightly larger than x max - x min and then divide the range into the desired number of bins

it works like range so i need to pass it a number one greater than the max number in the current index

i am trying to create a figure in which the colorbar will extend beyond the data range go higher than the max value of data

to create equal bins you can simply first define a min and max value which is slightly smaller than both range

if min is bigger than max i just return a random character from the entire range


z2 walk value2
if max z1 z2 range is less than or equal to table2 max value2 where table1.type table2.type

i have this grid each coordinate in the grid can be either closed or open i m tying to using an open coordinate find all the open coordinates around the first that are valid and the walk range between then is equal or lower than the max walk range


others
the recursive cte is troublesome because it is limited to a max size of 32 767 much smaller than potential range sizes and has the very real possibility of being very slow

if you have larger numbers you ll need to declare an array for your lookup table with a size equal to one more than the max integer value in the range you re using which is why i only recommended this approach for a relatively small range

3 is it filtered to a narrower than max time range or not crank it up to last 90 days or maybe an even bigger custom range

while using md-slider from angular-material if the range of max and min is less then the slider is looking fine

i am trying to give user a popup msg if cell value is less than max value of certain range and then go back to previous value of same cell

take a look at your picture - all the range you want have ending time greater than min and starting time less than max

the whenever clause is required in this case to prevent min values being higher than the max values and to ensure that the range size does not exceed the capacity of an int

i m working on slider that updates 2 text boxes with values the slider is in a limited range so it doesn t give values lower higher than min max

and this number is larger than max so it doesn t fit into the range

figuring out the necessary exponent range is much more straightforward if you can describe the max and min possible absolute values of your input you can easily find suitable corresponding binary minimum and maximum exponent

a sample of visual inspections suggests that the max length is more likely in the 200 to 300 character range

third you initialised end to len lis2 this will give indexerror list index out of range if you are trying to search for an element which is not present in the list and is greater than the max element in the list say 23

basically if you know that your events are never larger than a given duration you can search for a bounded range that s larger than the max duration then add restrictions to get rid of the extra stuff that matched

i want to make sure that the user does not enter a zero for the max value and also that the min value is less than the max value not equal to but less than - i need the range of values max - min

take your large function and compare it to the max from your source range if it is less than max display none if otherwise have it display the max

for ease of debugging i pass the value of to reactive values and print the first date range s value to the console rendered to check whether the it is smaller or bigger than the min and max of the corresponding date column as i did in the lapply function

since your container is sorted you can use std max_element on a range ending with the first element greater than your max use std find_if with a lambda or std lower_bound to get this range

if you look how floating point numbers are implemented they can t represent all numbers between their max and min as the number of real numbers in a range is bigger than infinite

the new randomint takes min and max which defines the range the parameters are exclusive so the range is covered better

the python built-in range will make a series of values for you starting with adding k each time and stopping with the last multiple of k that is less than max x

issue here is i need to submit myform but because of min max attribute i get this tip value must be less than or equal to 20 or value must be greater than or equal to 10 for the inputs submitted lesser or greater than the range provided in min and max attributes respectively because of this my form does not get submitted

a signed 64-bit integer range from âˆ 2 63 to 2 63 âˆ 1 the absolute value of 0x8000000000000000 or âˆ 2 63 is 2 63 is bigger than the max 64-bit integer

doing sort_heap on a max_heap with the max at the front initially will repeatedly pop the front to the back and sort the range according to less which is the default comparison operator

a taylor series expansion is a good starting point for the coefficients but you usually want to minimize the max-absolute-error or relative error over that specific range and taylor series coefficients likely leave have a lower or higher outlier over that range rather than having the max positive error nearly matching the max negative error

main problem why i cant adopt those solution is that every of my random values has different range and i need the values to be uniformly distributed withing the range no frequency occurances at min max for example which happens if i cut off the values which are less greater than min max

age can be in the range of 0..100 but i want also to validate crossing values i mean that max is greather than or equal to min

if you disable elastic axis and make sure you specify a range that is higher than the max value you can select the point

that occasional max threshold is actually bigger than the range of small instance

here is a dynamic solution that works for any range of numbers where min is less than max

beware that an input string longer than the max number of digits once transformed will not be truncated and will be longer than for values in the correct range

the range function produces a list of integers from 0 less than the max len s by step 3

figure the max values yourself and use integer range min to max to ensure no bigger than necessary usage

the dis min max part sets a range of min and max values this distribution can come up with which means it will never generate a value bigger than max or smaller than min

to return a random integer equal or greater than min smaller or equal to max with chance probability of the result to equal x and 100-chance probability spread uniformly among all other results in the given range

so my question is - can we rewrite the below query without using max to be faster on large data sets in the 100+ million range

if you want to exlude a number 4 that means the range is smaller by 1 so use r.nextint 5 and if the result is the excluded number then return the max allowed which is 5 because it will never be generated because you used max - 1

if max and min are independent variables the extra subtraction for max-min will waste time but if that expression can be precomputed at compile time or if it can be computed once at run-time to test many numbers against the same range the above expression may be computed efficiently even in the case where the value is within range if a large fraction of values will be below the valid range it may be faster to use because it will exit early if value is less than min

so if you re getting a step exceeds the specified range error i d guess that the default step value 1 is larger than the max of the range the result of .

i know that in general for a set of range if the max of the mins is less than the min of the maxes than they intersect but the circular nature of degrees makes this a bit more complicated

if requestedsize bigger than max size of the range

a variation on pentadecagon you are free to set n arbitrary values on the diagonal in some range min..max containing x and fill the rest of the array with lower than min on one side and higher than max on the other

update having does not work with between because it already selects a result set with a range where the max is less than the result of count

it looks like the default calulation of the range slider is min + max - min 2 or min if max is less than min

i ll leave the rest up to you ov checking for error conditions such as more than 1 column passed in the range or range of unequal size or a max # of items returned being larger than the range size


floating-point	fractions---------------------------------------------------

others
all other fractions floats have more digits after the dot when expressed in decimal because the representation of floating-point numbers is binary not decimal

and using floating-point values is more realistic - you need fractions values because when you rotate something the new coordinates will nearly always be non integral

the floating-point numbers are rounded to have not more than eight fractions digits

so it seems that python s floating-point division is internally done with high enough precision to know that 1 0.05 that s the float literal 0.05 not the exact decimal fractions 0.05 is actually less than 20 but the float type in itself is incapable of representing the difference


int single integer
therefore ieee 754 single precision floating-point format has 23-bits fractions and int type has 32 bits so if the integer is larger than 2 24-1 the float type can t represent it exactly

a floating-point format with a n-bit fractions can t represent the integer which is larger than 2 n+1 -1 because it will lose the precision


stringbuilder	stringwriter---------------------------------------------------

others
building on the previous good answers stringwriter is actually much more versatile than stringbuilder providing lots of overloads


emacs	jedit---------------------------------------------------

others
jedit is still pretty good but emacs is quite better


dotnetzip	sharpziplib---------------------------------------------------

others
dotnetzip is much easier to use than sharpziplib example of zipping all files in folder

i used it because it is small 6 kb compiled with just the extraction making it far smaller than dotnetzip which is more than 150 kb and is more permissive than sharpziplib

dotnetzip offers native support and has a quite friendly api and is my opinion more flexible than sharpziplib

gave up and switched to sharpziplib as it doesn t blow up on simple extract but sure would be nice to know what was wrong with dotnetzip it has a nicer api


unix	solaris---------------------------------------------------

others
my case in particular is with solaris servers but generic unix bsd tools are more than welcome

it is compiled on windows and unix systems including somewhat more exotic platforms like aix zlinux solaris and hpux


hadoop	ambari---------------------------------------------------

others
can i configure more than one hadoop cluster via ui of ambari


python-daemon	daemons---------------------------------------------------

others
i have a basic python daemons created using older version of python-daemon and this code


memcpy	strdup---------------------------------------------------

others
because of the above replace strdup with strlen malloc memcpy memcpy is slightly faster than strcpy


equals	gethashcode---------------------------------------------------

others
in the equals method only if you re certain the ensuing equals implementation is much more expensive than gethashcode which is not vast majority of cases

override both methods but make gethashcode more tolerant than equals that means make unequal objects have the same hash code and not the opposite

1 is comparison via gethashcode check if the hashcode of both objects are the same faster than equals

and that is for performance reasons assuming that a gethashcode implementation should always be much faster than an equals implementation

not sure about the overhead of calling gethashcode a few million times but comparing two ints is probably going to be a lot quicker than the equals object method

equals on the other hand can test accross a larger number of fields - ie its test is more specific than gethashcode comparisons


slower union equivalent
so gethashcode should be much faster than actually running equals

even though gethashcode itself should be fast it s not mostly faster than equivalent equals

gethashcode should be a lot quicker than equals but doesn t need to be unique

if you do not implement gethashcode union will call equals which will work but is slower than gethashcode


phpstorm	aptana---------------------------------------------------

others
phpstorm takes a few minutes to synchronize the project and aptana takes even longer to rebulild the project


eloquent	ardent---------------------------------------------------

others
however i started using ardent to make validation easier and noticed that it has a useful feature for defining eloquent relationships


tinyint	boolean---------------------------------------------------

others
for all thing with boolean is better tinyint 1 or enum y n

does tinyint in mysql take up more space than boolean

2 from an indexing point of view you could argue that an index on a boolean well tinyint field is smaller than indexing a datetime field


strdup	calloc---------------------------------------------------

others
he cried. will save the string on the static storage and you will not be able to do most of the function on them you better work with strdup in your function or malloc and calloc to be able to use all the function


phpunit	behat---------------------------------------------------

others
i think you should extract logic of titles to separated classes and then test it by phpunit or use more appropriate testing solutions like behat or selenium

phpunit does also have bdd features but behat is much more targetted toward that style

for general testing phpunit is a more well-established product while behat is focussed on tests written using bdd methodology behaviour driven design


x509	openpgp---------------------------------------------------

others
openpgp is simpler than x509 but more limited especially if you wish to have a strong legal meaning behind the certificates


mathml	mathjax---------------------------------------------------

others
note that you can configure mathjax to allow for more than one input form so could use asciimath for everything else and mathml for this

if you are targeting android you can use firefox for android by developing a webapp that has native mathml support and because of it will be much faster than mathjax or other javascript solution

in addition the need for polyfills for mathml complicates matters further as they may handle the interaction differently as can be seen in the sample below when using the button to load mathjax


sin	sqrt---------------------------------------------------

others
it s like asking whether sin is faster than sqrt


better 1-sin function
if i want to calculate a sin and a cos is it cheaper to calculate a sin and a cos or calculate a sin then a sqrt 1-sin 2 to get the cos

the jni sincos is better than computing sin and cos but the sqrt approach is still faster

an two for a function like sqrt i could probably write my own constexpr but something like sin or cos would be trickier so is there away around it


apk	dex---------------------------------------------------

others
so the solution for you would be to have static contents contents of apk like its manifest file jar file dex file res folder etc ready in a folder create a copy as a temp folder modify resources contents and not names as per user needs then finally create zip of this temp folder and sign it to have the desired .apk file no need for java complier then


catransition	uiswipegesturerecognizer---------------------------------------------------

others
if you want to use a continuous gesture that tracks the user s finger you can use uipangesturerecognizer rather than uiswipegesturerecognizer and i think animatewithduration is better than catransition in that case


gridview	rowdatabound---------------------------------------------------

others
i have a gridview and on rowdatabound i use this code to change the background of every second row so the gridview can be read better


wxhaskell	gtk2hs---------------------------------------------------

others
wxhaskell is probably a little easier to build if you are not on linux gtk2hs is likely easier if you are linux hosted but both are pretty complex to build to be honest as there are a significant number of dependencies in both cases

in practice i ve never had resource management issues with wxhaskell although i agree that it s possible and is an area handled better by gtk2hs which uses reference counting in the underlying library


snap.svg	fabricjs---------------------------------------------------

others
my speed test claims that svg is significantly faster than canvas at least snap.svg seems to be significantly faster than fabricjs


qgraphicsview	qwidget---------------------------------------------------

performance work extra
plus the performance was much faster than on qwidget because of qgraphicsview optimizations

i ve read that painting to a qwidget is sometimes faster than qgraphicsview but it would by a lot of extra work for the mouse handling i think


others

qgraphicsview	qframe---------------------------------------------------

others
i have a qgraphicsview nested within a few widgets qframe and then in a qtab and i want to be able to drag-and-drop a qtablewidget which is within the qgraphicsscene onto a totally different widget - another qtablewidget which is much higher up in the window but not a parent


autogrow	scrollbar---------------------------------------------------

others
i am trying to stop a textarea with autogrow.js from growing after 300px height and then destroying autogrow textarea so that it has scrollbar although the code i have used to do this is working fine i can stop the textarea from growing after 300px but when that happens the textarea becomes smaller than 300px suddenly


system.in	system.out---------------------------------------------------

others
you could try to more accurately mock system.in by returning fewer bytes but not indicating the end of the stream until the next call to system.out is detected or change approach and use runtime.exec to spawn a new jvm and capture all output from that process


stringbuilder	bufferedwriter---------------------------------------------------

others
i wanted to ask if there is a better solution than using stringbuilder to cut some part of a string which is parsed from a method through bufferedwriter to a file


grooveshark	soundcloud---------------------------------------------------

others
i used soundcloud api and sdk and it is better than the grooveshark api which till now i don t know how to embed songs and use my own player anyways soundcloud is good just try it goodluck


vectorwise	infobright---------------------------------------------------

others
but as well as infobright if you re going commercial then checkout vectorwise it s quicker and similar priced


cruisecontrol	teamcity---------------------------------------------------

others
for a one man shop teamcity is far easier to setup and configure than cruisecontrol


multiplication	modulo---------------------------------------------------

others
this has some advantages over the original method when n is larger than the modulo divided by 2 since we can reduce the number of multiplication by solving for the modular inverse

implementing multiplication and division might be more costly than you would like but at least addition is easy modulo protecting against over underflow and you claim to not need any operations so even better

note that is equivalent to i 10 but much faster since modulo is around 10 times slower than multiplication

inverse modulo for 300 time take 1.422 seconde more than executing division sub and multiplication 10k time even the core of inverse modulo is build with same division and sub and multiplication functions and for this number it just do 150 time inside while help plz why


slower priority integer
it appears that you consider modulo to have lower precedence than multiplication and division when in fact it does not

multiplication division and modulo have the same precedence and they all have higher precedence than addition and subtraction

note parentheses are redundant as division and multiplication have the same priority and modulo has higher precedence over addition

integer multiplication division and modulo are much slower than integer addition and subtraction

it might seem unintuitive but it has a lower precedence than multiplication addition and modulo operations


parse.com	firebase---------------------------------------------------

others
i haven t used parse.com but i think firebase is easier for a beginner


silex	slim---------------------------------------------------

others
i think silex produces a bit uglier code than slim but i m afraid to choose slim because it s changing constantly and i will be stuck with the current version if it breaks backward compatibility

silex seems to have a bigger community than slim maybe it s just my point of view


abstract-class	superclass---------------------------------------------------

others
for example you want to use abstract-class in such a case that each of the subclassing is a more specific type of its abstract superclass fruit apple orange banana grape strawberries etc. and you want to use non-abstract superclass in a relationship such as dad and son

you can think of extends from a superclass if the derived class is of the same type.i mean that when a class extends an abstract-class they both should be of the same type the only difference being that the superclass has a more general behavior and the sub class has a more specific behavior


draggable	droppable---------------------------------------------------

div bigger width
i have a draggable parent element ice cream wrapper which is bigger than the droppable one teeth

i want when draggable div dragged into droppable div the droppable div color get another color then draggable div width height get bigger and exactly fit to droppable div

the draggable div is greater in height and width than droppable div

this means that your draggable is the full width of the container which is much wider than the droppable and thus can t possibly intersect by 50

when the draggable item is larger than the droppable div for some reason it will always place the appointment in the droppable div box that is directly below the one i am targetting

but i have a problem dragging to a droppable that is smaller than the draggable

it seems like the draggable element including the margin is bigger than the droppable element and therefore the dropped status is set although the element does not seems to touch the upper droppable yet

this overlap is somewhat forced when the draggable is bigger than the droppable

as the width of the draggable element is greater than the placeholder i can t get the placeholder to accept the draggable element to be droppable

how can i make the droppable to not accept more than one draggable div

it s just a hunch but maybe it s only a matter of the size of your draggable being too big and being over more than one droppable item

when i made dimension of draggable div smaller than droppable div then drop event triggered successfully

the draggable div is 3 times bigger than one droppable

alternatively you could set a width on your draggable which is less than twice the width of your droppable area or combine a set width with one of the above options for a better user experience

because you have not set a width on your draggable they are much wider than double your droppable width

perhaps you find it strange since the target droppable s size is much smaller than the draggable

how can i make the two droppable div s to not accept more than one draggable elements

it works nicely but from the rich ui perspective it s boring so i was wondering since the draggable image is bigger than the droppable how could i do assuming it s possible to have the droppable container suck the bigger image until if fills its dimensions

and the size of the draggable div s should be smaller than the droppable div so that they fit in the droppable container

apparently the draggable li element is bigger than the droppable div because the li is block size and the div has a 150px width

p.s this will only work if the draggable is smaller than droppable which is true in this case


z-index visible higher
for draggable set higher z-index than droppable so that draggable will always be visible over droppable

i can make this work if the z-index of the droppable is less than the container but then you can t see where the draggable is since it s hidden behind the container


others
i was able to remove the unwanted behavior described above by turning the droppable into the parent of the element and added a margin padding that is slightly larger than the draggable snaptolerance

in the real case the draggable can become taller than the screen height and the tree control with the droppable is almost the full page height

but it contains what i want draggable stuff with html injected that renders content on an iframe or a div or whatever and that new content is also droppable to insert more stuff inside that code

without draggable seems more like it but then i can t use the droppable

when the ajax call completes and the status code is a 200 you do some minor css tweaks and then disable the ability of the droppable from receiving any more draggable items

append draggable to droppable to make things easier

to know on which droppable the draggable was dropped the higher droppable added a class to the draggable when it was dragged over it

when the draggable is dragged over the droppable you change it s snapmode option from outer to inner and then when it s dragged out and the droppable is no longer active you change it back

i have a validation on the droppable for not adding more than one draggable per droppable


point element item
the problem you outlined is that the droppable is allowing more than 1 draggable item to be placed inside of it

the draggable is covering more than one droppable element and at this point there are multiple event.target.id s being covered


highcharts	fusioncharts---------------------------------------------------

others
customization and variety of animations highcharts has more customizable animations when compared to fusioncharts javascript charts


qabstractitemmodel	qstandarditemmodel---------------------------------------------------

others
do need implementation of qabstractitemmodel that can be more useful than qstandarditemmodel


listview	gridview---------------------------------------------------

easier better
i think using a gridview is better for your case than a listview

you may also consider using a listview which is easier to customize than the gridview


others
by using a gridview with an item width as wide as the screen size 320 you can get it to behave like a listview and if the gridview get s wider the content will automatically produce two columns for you

note that i do not want to bind a gridview directly to the view property from a resourcedictionary where the datatemplates x shared attribute is set to false as this leads to problems in the xaml designer view can t be shared by more than one listview

the error is because the gridview is being applied to more than one listview

but don t know if listview or a gridview could be more useful for what i need

i wasn t able to find out how to do it and since i didn t have more time i decided to go with a listview and a gridview which was actually easier to achieve

basically gridview are the most powerful way to present tabular information whereas listview controls are for more complicated displays of repeated data

i add a gridview as headerview of listview when i change gridview s content it s height does t changes i can only see a part of gridview s new content.i have tried invalidate but it does t work.in the gridview i click the more button and then change the adapter of gridview but i can see only a part of new content of gridview and when i call geidview.getheight it does t change

i tried replacing the gridview with a listview and the scrolling of the listview is much faster

i have a sneaky suspicion that listview its view property and the gridview are more closely related than it would appear at first glance and achieving my goal may not be possible in any practical sense but this is just a hunch


control display finer
i believe gridview allows much finer grained control of display than does listview

templating rows like this is possible in a gridview but the listview control is much better suited to this type of data

here s another article that describes the listview control and why it s probably a better fit than the gridview

it will produce the desired layout with a gridview but indeed the asp listview is a better choice

if you have scenarios where you need more control over how the table is rendered the listview would be better choice but based on what you said simple tables i would recommend the gridview

i m trying to convert a gridview to a listview to allow me more control over the table display

listview much better than the gridview dataview in that they let you write out clean html

i think the listview is better than gridview in this situation


ferret	sphinx---------------------------------------------------

others
i ve used ferret in the past with few problems although i ve heard sphinx is better


mvp	presenter---------------------------------------------------

others
imho activity is your controller or perhaps presenter a la mvp is the better architectural analogy layout xml and their constituent views are the view layer and your database is your model

since the flow of logic is still basically a loop but the api boundaries of the presenter is a cleaner boundary than view in mvp which helps decouple v and m in mvp than is possible in mvc

my main and pretty noob question is it ok from an mvp perspective to have a presenter that communicates with more than one interactor or should just be one interactor per presenter

i think you would lose a lot of those benefits with mvp as the view and presenter are more tightly coupled

also this way mvp pattern becomes more testable as you can mock the view with fake object and test your presenter in unit tests

to summarise the differences controllers in the mvc have more control over the ui and handle events while a presenter in the mvp is more passive and just presents information through the ui

however since i m using mvp it have been more complicated than expected because i ll have to have a presenter for form foo with fields a and b then a presenter for bar with with field c and a reference to the presenter of foo so that it can inject the fields a and b into it

the use of a presenter is closer to mvp and gets away from the dependency injection model advocated by apple mvc

mvp offers greater seperation as your presenter have no knowledge of web centric concepts


view views pages
i have been searching on the net and i made a couple of examples of both of them but i m even more confused because in some sample web pages mvp uses more than 2 interfaces to communicate the presenter with the view layer some ones even have completely blank interfaces only declarated but in other ones it only takes two interfaces to transport data from presenter to view

mvc framework is suitable only for web applications while mvp can be more universal and can work for web forms and windows forms - views implement interfaces for presenter to use and views themselves handle implementation details pertaining to navigation


qgraphicsscene	qframe---------------------------------------------------

others
i have a qgraphicsview nested within a few widgets qframe and then in a qtab and i want to be able to drag-and-drop a qtablewidget which is within the qgraphicsscene onto a totally different widget - another qtablewidget which is much higher up in the window but not a parent


marionette	underscore.js---------------------------------------------------

others
some newer with backbone only and older with marionette since marionette uses backbone both uses underscore.js


moq	typemock---------------------------------------------------

others
or would a tool like typemock be better suited than moq in this case

moles is more often compared contrasted to typemock in that it offers a set of facilities outside of moq and or rhinomocks sweet spot


extjs	ext.net---------------------------------------------------

others
i d rather not use use extjs directly - i m looking to expedite delivery and ext.net seems much easier


stdout	stdio---------------------------------------------------

others
you re more likely to be using the low level open close read and write which are a level below the stdio printf fopen stdout you re more likely to be used to as a newer programmer


ggplot2	aesthetics---------------------------------------------------

reasoning plot
or use ggplot2 to achieve a more aesthetics plot as you wish

my reasoning for this is that i may want to add aesthetics to the plot and ggplot2 allows this more than plot


others

onchange	onblur---------------------------------------------------

others
edit you probably only want to validate when the value changes and field loses focus that s why imo the onchange event would be more appropriate than onblur not onblure

also onchange won t work you ll need to use onkeyup although onblur is probably more sane


everyone focusout validation
also i am not sure why everyone is suggesting onblur isn t onchange is better for validation purpose

onchange is a better choice than onblur or focusout because blur and focusout also fire when the contents of the text field hasn t changed


ng-include	ng-controller---------------------------------------------------

others
the priority level of ng-controller is lower than that of ng-include


rcurl	rvest---------------------------------------------------

others
or you could do it in a way more readable fashion with rvest which ultimately uses rcurl and css selectors


gridview	datalist---------------------------------------------------

others
i am trying to bind it with a gridview or a datalist whatever is more appropriate without success

gridview has much more bells and whistles than datalist


uitapgesturerecognizer	uigesturerecognizer---------------------------------------------------

others
i added the check for uitapgesturerecognizer in case your class handles more than 1 uigesturerecognizer s and you only want to remove that

the one thing that argues against this in your case is that if you are not actually using anything that uitapgesturerecognizer offers over uigesturerecognizer then specifying the more specific type would be over-specifying the argument type relative to what the code actually expects


opencv	boofcv---------------------------------------------------

others
i have made an app similar to yours for android we use boofcv whose surf is much faster than opencv


postgresql	mysql---------------------------------------------------

security fewer surprises
i d have said that postgresql is more security aware than mysql supporting roles more authentication methods ... but that the database itself has generally a very limited impact on the security of an application

i would recommend postgresql for a beginner as it has far fewer surprises than mysql

traditionally postgresql has had fewer security issues than mysql but they are both doing very well on that


better data support
generally speaking i find postgresql lends itself to 24 7 operations better than mysql

there are workloads where postgresql is better and there are workloads where mysql is better

local installs of postgresql or even mysql might be a better choice than sqlite for what you re doing

honestly though postgresql scales much better than mysql

now i m not sure if i d say postgresql is generally better than mysql -- there are certainly things that mysql does much better and so it certainly has its uses -- but these are a few things i absolutely love about it

p.s postgresql have better features to store json data compared to mysql or mariadb

while mysql is more famous for serious enterprise-quality database where preserving your data is critical i recommend postgresql

postgresql supports recursive queries in the form of recursive common table expressions which make querying heirarchical data easier than in mysql and also give better performance

also if you open to moving away from mysql i ve found that postgresql has much better resolution of deadlocks

if you are looking for location based queries in relational databases postgresql is more matured compared to mysql

you re right postgresql has much better support for sql and other advanced features so there s a very good case for why postgresql is superior to mysql

i m currently considering which is a better choice for my php application - mysql which i m more familiar with or postgresql which has less php support no object-oriented wrapper but seems tried and tested

postgresql seem to better than mysql in terms of speed

the only reason i was considering postgresql was that some research suggested postgresql has much better support for changing schemas along the way than mysql

in your case postgresql may be a better option than mysql because your query is going to likely be against secondary indexes

postgresql is way better than mysql in nearly every respect

for a database i generally use mysql though postgresql might be more suitable if you do lots of really complex queries

mysql is easier than postgresql but it doesn t really matter either way

postgresql is faster than mysql s innodb

however i don t know whether databases in my case mysql maybe postgresql would be better at handling compressing option a in contrast to option b

mysql and other relational dbs such as postgresql are better data stores than mongodb for relational data

in other words is mysql better or worse than postgresql to handle unicode etc

also you might take the time to compare postgresql and see if there is something about it that meets your needs as well or better than mysql

i really like postgresql s indexes which are far better than mysql s

fyi postgresql scales better than mysql on multi-processor overlapping requests from a review i was reading a few months back sorry no link

does this affect postgresql harder than mysql

postgresql gets much better performance and this is coming from a former mysql partisan

postgresql is much better suited for data warehousing compared to mysql

and any python orm will make it easier to switch out your database if you find something better than mysql like postgresql

what i am hearing from our group leader is that postgresql is better than mysql when working with coordinates

i just recently switched databases to postgresql which has given me a slew of problems although i must admit i like it a lot better than mysql

is postgresql a better option than mysql for partitioning tables by date

i d also recommend postgresql over mysql if you are going to have nested comments as postgresql does hierarchical querying better than mysql

i start off with something like mysql and then later on i might decide that postgresql makes a better fit - and if i have done everything the propel way switching to the new engine is trivial - rebuild and go

the other question is that what i am hearing from our group leader is that postgresql is better than mysql when working with coordinates

anyways mysql is bad and on longterm especially if you are enough good for java i suggest you to use some better db with postgresql you were really satisfied i think

i would need a scalable database so probably postgresql would be better than mysql

however i find postgresql to support more sql features than mysql and be more efficient when handling more data

if you need spatial data capabilities postgis with postgresql is better than mysql

postgresql is also a lot better imo than mysql and is the recommended database to use with django according to a lot of the people close to django

i found that postgresql 9.3 has better capabilities for json than the mysql versions i am using

in my cases postgresql was better than mysql mysql do not completely support unicode

postgresql is better than mysql in many ways

worse with mysql if you drop multiple indexes on the same table it will re-copy the table once for each index you re removing instead of being smart and re-copying the data once without all the indexes you re dropping. is something like this happening with postgresql

given postgresql s reputation for doing things better than mysql or at least as good as i daresay that postgresql would demonstrate similar performance if properly used

an efficiently configured mysql is better than a badly configured postgresql and vice-versa

but if you do a lot of heavy updates to a table as often as other threads have to read then the default locking in mysql is not the best and postgresql can be a better choice performance-wise

some say mysql is much better for bigger projects while others think just go with postgresql

i have used both and even migrated projects from mysql to postgresql and in my experience postgresql was the better choice

does anyone know issues with mysql s i18n support and if postgresql would be better placed for building an application with indic language support kannada telugu tamil etc using utf-8 encoding

then postgresql is much better than mysql

with correct locking for safety reasons and heavy concurrent use postgresql performed better than mysql

is postgresql better than mysql for such purpose

i was told that postgresql is a better choice than mysql for displaying hierarchical data so i installed postgresql and i m ready to go

mysql can do a good job with a small number of clients at higher client counts the locking mechanism in postgresql might do a better job

postgresql has better support but the support by mysql depends on the used storage engine

i don t like mysql licence firebird and postgresql are better

some people were saying that postgresql is better for security purposes whereas mysql is becoming more feature rich.

either postgresql more proven than mysql for such huge data

no cross-database queries if you need something like that mapping mysql databases to postgresql schemas is probably easier

you may find postgresql to be a better free choice than mysql but you ll have to evaluate this yourself 1

and a wiki for why postgresql is better than mysql


others
mysql is more than capable of serving your needs as well as alex s suggestion of postgresql

problems with corruption seem to be more frequent with mysql than with postgresql

as i said postgresql is far superior and i hate mucking with mysql s bizarre bugs and i think that overall postgresql performance is probably better than mysql for any even slightly complicated query

may be postgresql takes less time than mysql

with django it is easy to use postgresql instead of mysql so i tried it with the same query and same data in db postgresql is much faster that mysql x10 more faster while using inner join analyse shows it uses indexes unlike mysql

note i m not saying mysql s license won t work for you but postgresql is definitely simpler

i suppose postgresql could have higher metadata overhead than mysql or has to extend its data files in larger chunks but i can t find anything obvious that postgresql wastes space for which migrating to mysql is the cure

i am using postgresql btw which can do more than mysql incase that changes things

i also personally believe that postgresql has better handling of complex queries that include sub-selects and the like which most mysql users used to avoid

why postgresql is more capable than others mysql etc. on django

mysql is probably part of the problem but updating to postgresql would be a larger task than i want to commit to right now

explain in postgresql is way more useful than in mysql

as for reliability i think that postgresql is more reliable especially when compared to mysql using myisam - innodb is a lot better here

it seems mysql is more forgiving with this than postgresql but in every case you use a reserved word you should escape it

postgresql supports some more security features than mysql for example integration with gssapi or kerberos for logins last i checked mysql didn t have these

following the first answer it appears that postgresql is more compliant to sql standard than mysql so it needs a group by clause for each selected column you want to display with your aggregated function

in fact this presentation which still refers to an older incomplete version of mysql s opengis support suggests that with proper indexing some mysql geospatial actions may actually perform better than postgresql postgis though i m sure that s up for debate

i know postgresql could be considered more mature than mysql with regards to locking thanks to mvcc - can i use row-locking or some other feature in postgresql instead of the token field

that s why it s usually said that mysql is best for webapps while postgresql is more enterprisey

for example pyqt is already available for python 3 as well as 2 and you can use postgresql a splendid open-source sql database engine much more standard than mysql via py-postgresql

drupal 7 mysql 5.0.15 or higher with pdo postgresql 8.3 or higher

all that said postgresql is much more acid compliant than mysql it handles fks just as you re needing and i would generally recommend it based on what you ve expressed in your post

does that mean perhaps rails team favor postgresql slightly more than mysql

i ve used both db systems before and while postgresql is great for it s licensing terms and standards compliance mysql is definitely easier to get up and running quickly

or maybe i want to use mysql for forum posts but postgresql for geo-clustering more realistic for me heh

this works fine on my local and current hosted environment using mysql but postgresql is clearly more strict

postgresql with the optional hstore module might be better than mysql at this.

postgresql is much more similar to oracle than mysql is

b use indexes - postgresql has bigger repertoar of indexes then mysql so use it - there are gist gin indexes

secondly would migrating from mysql to postgresql be more involved dan doing a dumpdata on the mysql dbase change the settings to point to postgresql and the loaddata on the new backend

postgresql license bsd is undoubtedly more simple than mysql s

for large and complicated systems yes there are enough bugs quirks that can rear their ugly heads - i am convinced that the reason that people tend to always go with mysql over postgresql is that the name mysql is much more attractive

ps you can also migrate to postgresql it s smarter than mysql when choosing right indexes

poor performance from mysql has more to do with it not being smart and automatically creating an optimized plan like sql server postgresql or oracle would

since postgresql is a lot more sane than mysql there are not that many tricks to report on

mysql is more preferred db choise for symfony projects symfony mysql symfony postgresql so choosing postgresql is a rare decision and maybe there are some pitfalls those we have to consider

postgresql is older than mysql so it might have influenced them

mysql is not less complicated that postgresql -- they re the same thing

postgresql has more established support for this but mysql has played catch up in the last year or so and has a working method of this in the latest versions

triggers in postgresql have a syntax a bit more complex than mysql because they execute procedures as the action

if i were able to upgrade the server s versioning of mysql to 5.5 would innodb be a safer bet than postgresql

this is a weak point that iirc postgresql can handle better but with mysql you have to work around that by reverting the changes yourself in case of rollbacks

while mysql has a larger user base postgresql is gaining more an more popularity ever since implementing several crucial features that were missing in earlier versions

my question is that will postgresql suffice for having such a large number of entries while performing both read and writes or should i switch to mysql because i heard mysql is more advantageous to read heavy tasks

if you are more comfortable with mysql because you should install postgresql locally if you are going to use postgresql for production then you should consider using one of the mysql add-ons heroku offers

i had mentioned that in our rails application all select queries dropped below 100ms after switching to postgresql whereas some of the complex joins generated by activerecord would occasionally take as much as 15s or more with mysql 5.1 because of nested loops with inner table scans even when indices were available

mysql indexes were occupying more size than the table data itself and postgresql was using considerably lesser sizes

postgresql is worth learning and much more advanced than mysql

the big question as far as i m concerned is still outstanding -- will postgresql require more fiddling and configuration to run well than mysql

i wonder why postgresql s single insert statement is completely faster than mysql s when autocommit is turned on


large faster big
i ve built a rails application using mysql and now would like to move some models to a postgresql database for performance reasons the tables are quite big and postgresql is faster

and postgresql has fewer experienced administrators than the big databases and mysql which i believe contributes to the reputation

some recent tests we did showed that postgresql does perform faster than mysql and we believe the table partitioning feature in postgresql will be very important with a table in our database we foresee to grow into 100 million rows and more in production

i did some benchmarking 3 years ago may be stale... which showed that on large datasets basically postgresql fulltext is 10-100x faster than mysql and xapian 10-100x faster than postgresql but not integrated

if you want to use sql i strongly reccommend postgresql it seems to deal with large databases and frequent writes a lot better than mysql


popular shame web
while postgresql is less popular than mysql most of the serious web hosting supports it

though mysql is more popular than postgresql but instagram is using postgresql maybe due to these reasons

it s a shame postgresql isn t more popular than mysql since it supports exactly this feature out-of-the-box you d only have to share one sequence object between tables.


stricter error type
mysql does a lot of implicit type conversions postgresql is rather more strict and requires you to say exactly what you mean

i totally understand the error and assume that the mysql implementation is less sql conform than the postgresql implementation

postgresql is stricter to the sql standard than mysql is

in general mysql is optimized for pkey lookups and postgresql is more generally optimized for complex use cases

mysql is more permissive and allows the non-standard use of distinct but postgresql throws an error

but in mysql it is ok and in postgresql it is wrong and ask for the other fields besides site_id either in a group by clause or in a aggregation function i know that postgresql is stricter on sql than mysql so i must select the site_id in the query object of msg_published but in pure sqlalchemy i can do like this

i am aware that postgresql interpretation of the sql standard is stricter than mysql and that consequently this type of query won t work...and have read a number of posts on stackoverflow and elsewhere on the subject - but none of them seem to be the definitive answer on this subject

the question is is mysql somehow more resistant than postgresql to sql injection attack under the perl dbi and why might this be the case

postgresql is a little more strict than mysql about type conversion and does not let you implicitly cast convert between numbers and strings

postgresql is stricter about conversions than mysql is and generally will throw an error rather than try to convert a string to an integer if it doesn t look like one


familiar compliant table
my problem is i m more familiar with mysql and could probably figure this out but this is postgresql and i am still getting tripped up on syntax

while i am more familiar with mysql than with postgresql i believe it is true for both databases that sub-queries have a negative impact on performance relative to joins

postgresql is more sql compliant than mysql

looks like postgresql is a little more compliant than mysql so try this instead

not only does postgresql have a far more flexible indexing than mysql but the table approaches are very different also meaning the appropriate indexing strategies are as different as the tactics are

this is ancedotal but the postgresql servers i ve managed have always been much less troublesome than mysql which likes to randomly crash once in a while occasionally corrupting a table on the way down

while other databases like mysql can use only one index per table in most situations postgresql can use more than one

i am less familiar with postgresql than mysql but

i am more familiar with postgresql than mysql

postgresql is more compliant but if you re comfortable with mysql and you re using an orm you should probably use that

i only mention this because a lot of people are more familiar with mysql than postgresql so linking lastval to something familiar might clarify things


easier features options
i suggest postgresql it s more capable has more features and better support for complex queries and datatypes than mysql and has a lot of tuning options

mysql has some advantages like easy replication but postgresql is generally nicer to work with

mysql is more widely supported and a little easier to use but postgresql has some very cool features and functionality that s worth taking a gander at

however people often argue that postgresql is cleaner and easier to use that mysql

postgresql specifically has gotten easier to manage while mysql has lost some of the simplicity that gave it an advantage without picking up enough features that really matter

however postgresql s sql features are far more advanced than mysql s and mysql has a tendency to silently ignore things you tell it to do - especially in a default installation and if you rely on a foreign key to be created that might be a very unpleasant surprise

you might look at postgresql as i find it a bit easier to manage and maintain as i feel some aspects are more logical than mysql

i am using postgresql before which i tried mysql mysql is even worse


slower faster optimizer
in my personal openion mysql is slower than postgresql and mongo db

in my experiance with the two postgresql has shown to be faster on most write operations while mysql is slightly faster on the reads

in most regards postgresql is slower than mysql especially when it comes to fine tuning in the end

the query optimizer in postgresql is more advanced than in mysql and copes with complicated statements much better especially when it comes to sub-selects

mysql run 4x faster than postgresql

i did a simple performance test and i noticed postgresql is slower than mysql

i just checked the timings using mysql 5 and they are slightly worse than postgresql

mysql mariadb is slightly worse than postgresql

according to my own experience postgresql run much faster than mysql especially handling big tables 1.4 gb lineitem table in my case

postgresql is picky pickier than mysql -- all fields in the select list when using distinct must be present in the order_by and group_by clauses

do you find rails with postgresql is slower than mysql knowing that it produce more query on the background

mysql i am told can be optimized to do faster reads than postgresql but both are pretty ridiculously fast in terms of # transactions sec they support and it doesn t sound like that s your problem

postgresql requires more tuning than mysql to achieve optimal performance

mysql s version is apparently marginally faster than postgresql but lacks some of the more advanced spatial features therefore it s pretty much limited to finding records that match a certain range of coordinates

in general postgresql knows more tricks for how to optimize complicated queries than the mysql optimizer does but it also relies heavily on your having given the optimizer enough data to work with

postgresql is already slower than mysql up to a certain point it is actually faster when you have a ridiculously large database

postgresql is much more complete and solid and will much better support complex queries and their optimization while mysql may shine in terms of retrieval speed for extremely simple queries

for these ultra simple queries postgresql can be slower than mysql - postgresql has richer planner that works better on more complex queries but on trivial queries is slower

i ve tried switching from mysql to postgresql and whilst postgresql was fractionally faster it was a matter of 2-3

is file based caching faster than the mysql mariadb postgresql

unfortunately in postgresql select count is often slower than mysql to which it often get s compared to

i ve found that postgresql is in my expirience is slower as mysql


open source smarter
if you want open source postgresql is much smarter than mysql as well

personally i think mysql would be a better solution then postgresql if you are looking for an open source solution but keep in mind open source sql solutions with not be the easiest when it comes to scalability or a high availability environment if that is your ultimate goal


powerful robust mature
i cannot propose any db not knowing your specific needs but if you want to use a free software which excludes oracle and you re not already experienced with mysql you should try postgresql which is more powerful than mysql

there is also postgresql its a bit more robust than mysql and is free just the same

postgresql is far more powerful and scalable and doesn t have mysql s silly limitations and gotchas

i feel postgresql is much more mature and robust than mysql

i hear postgresql is more robust and doesn t crash like mysql does in these situations

postgresql has a more comprehensive gis extension . mysql s is as dumb as a flapjack in flatland

mysql is probably more often offered by shared hosting providers postgresql is probably a little more powerful

postgresql is a bit more restrictive than mysql

the mysql one was more stable than the postgresql one

postgresql will always be a little bit more mature than mysql


database hosts instance
from how i understand it postgresql is a more correct database implementation while mysql is less correct less compliant but faster

postgresql is good too but mysql is undoubtedly more popular and you re going to find more hosts that provide you a mysql database for instance if that matters


wma	speex---------------------------------------------------

others
speex is designed for speech and should perform better than wma mp3 or other audio codecs that are designed to handle music if you are just encoding speech which i assume since you are grabbing from the mic


cas	shibboleth---------------------------------------------------

others
conceptually it seems like a type of central authentication system cas but is more similar to shibboleth also a federated identity management system


pandas	prettytable---------------------------------------------------

others
a more lightweight approach than pandas is to use the prettytable module


sqldatasource	formview---------------------------------------------------

others
particularly with the dev stack i am using its seems the less controls formview gridview sqldatasource i use he less problems i run into


mouseout	mouseleave---------------------------------------------------

others
there can be times when mouseout is a better choice than mouseleave

some browsers implement the mouseenter mouseleave events that i ve noticed are more accurate than mouseout


alternative use idea
it should also be noted that mouseenter and mouseleave work somewhat differently and usually much better than mouseover and mouseout

also see i ve replaced mouseout with mouseleave which should work better than mouseout text will not jump up and down

imho mouseenter and mouseleave are much more reliable than mouseover and mouseout which tend to flicker

in this case mouseenter mouseleave has better behaviour and prevents bubbling compared to mouseover mouseout

i have no idea about the classes but i think mouseenter and mouseleave are better alternative for mouseout and mouseover

because jquery doesn t use mouseover and mouseout it uses mouseenter and mouseleave which are more suited to this scenario

also you might want to use mouseenter and mouseleave which are sanitized by jquery and are a little more reliable than mouseover and mouseout

this may make for various race conditions and may necessitate using events which give you earlier notification than mouseup mousedown mouseenter mouseleave mouseover mouseout

also instead of mouseover and mouseout use the better ones mouseenter and mouseleave or simply the .hover method


jpopupmenu	jmenuitem---------------------------------------------------

others
the jpopupmenu has this behavior but i need more than just jmenuitem


struts	wicket---------------------------------------------------

others
you could argue that the struts style is simpler and you can do it in wicket too it just isn t optimal but keeping the state only in the server has many advantages

while this is much less convenient than stateful wicket i still find much better than say stateless jsf or struts


natural struts2 stripes
for some people action based frameworks struts spring mvc are easier to grasp while for others component based ones jsf wicket come more natural

and beware that in this area there are many much more alternatives or fragmentation than in .net some more oriented to the mvc pattern struts struts2 stripes spring mvc some more component-based jsf tapestry wicket and some others gwt


spaces	linefeed---------------------------------------------------

others
then the rogue linefeed or maybe in future spaces will be more obvious

this regex does replace by a single spaces all contiguous spaces 2 or more followed by a linefeed or individual tabs

it makes minimal change to the text in particular it never splits a word doesn t change wc -w and for text with no more than single spaces in a row and no cr it doesn t change wc -c because it replaces spaces with linefeed rather than inserting linefeed

it seems like the linux method just using linefeed makes a lot more sense saves spaces and is easier to parse

s will match more than just spaces because it also matches vertical whitespaces like linefeed carriage returns.


mediarecorder	audiorecord---------------------------------------------------

others
this class leverages audiorecord which is a lower level approach to using mediarecorder


intersect	contains---------------------------------------------------

others
i d say the intersect method see answer by dasblinkenlight + any must work better than contains + any

edit just checked the performance of intersect it is slower than using .all with contains

given two ranges a a b and c c d do they intersect is one greater than the other or does one contains the other


skip-lists	queue---------------------------------------------------

others
your use cases are actually much easier than the skip-lists algorithmically because you avoid most needs for varlength paths by keeping the tail to queue cards to the end directly

the most simple would be an array but a double-ended queue or an indexed skip-lists b tree could be better depending on the data size we are talking about


factors	mean---------------------------------------------------

others
the problem is that when the zoom factors is increased to more than 1 the scrollbars are lost on richtextbox but the content is getting edited but not visible i mean the content is below the visible screen once the zoom is set back to normal i can see the content and scroll bars again could you please suggest what i am required to do to get the things right

try a different rate factors -crf 30 higher numbers mean uglier picture quality but also smaller file size

you can normalize data that is already normally distributed for example take data for average length of human beings 180 centimeter and scale every number by a factors so that the mean becomes less than 1 multiply every length by 1 180

note that this does not mean that the largest prime factors is less than sqrt n but that if there is a prime factors greater than sqrt n there is only one such prime factors

additionally the lowest possible big-o doesn t necessarily mean there aren t faster algorithms with better constant factors


growth allocations smaller
if your growth factors is larger than the golden mean that can t happen

if the factors is larger than the golden mean they never will

if the factors is smaller than the golden mean 1.6 and the previous allocations are contiguous with each other they ll eventually add up to a chunk that can satisfy a later requirement


joptionpane	jdialog---------------------------------------------------

others
using jdialog instead of joptionpane is better to put number of data

as part of the processing joptionpane invokes getwindowforcomponent on the argument before passing it through to the underlying jdialog which is slightly more general

i m trying to make a jdialog with the size of the joptionpane that contains but function getsize is returning something a little bit smaller than the joptionpane and the button of accept is not seen

usually when people want more flexibility than joptionpane offers it s basically a bunch of static factories for a few dialogs they write their own dialogs using jdialog


keras	tensorboard---------------------------------------------------

others
you should check out losswise it has a plugin for keras that s easier to use than tensorboard and has some nice extra features


jdom	xom---------------------------------------------------

others
there are libraries that build on the xml apis jdom dom4j or xom which are easier to use than the raw apis


bash	shellcheck---------------------------------------------------

others
shellcheck tends to be more explicit than bash

remember it will be helpful for you to use a site like shellcheck to learn more about potential pitfalls or the uniquenesses of bash syntax


igraph	networkx---------------------------------------------------

others
networkx is much easier to deal with and usually performance is good enough but for large brute force algorithms like this igraph will probably be at least an order of magnitude faster


min	median---------------------------------------------------

components first k
to find the median and left right you probably want to call it to find the median and then just do the max of the components of the array to the left and the min of the components to the right because you know once the median selection phase is done that all elements to the left of the median will be less than it and to the right will be greater or equal

so after calculating median of first k elements delete the first element directly from heap min or max according to whether it is greater or less than median using pointers and then use heapify at that position


others
from min to the median is less equal or greater than the one from


postgresql	greenplum---------------------------------------------------

others
greenplum and other similar solutions should work a bit better than postgresql depending on your data sets and use cases

according to the postgresql which i gather greenplum is based on documentation for sequence manipulation functions it should return the value most recently returned by nextval in the current session.


fasta	blast---------------------------------------------------

others
i think fasta might be better at finding alignments between dissimilar sequences than blast but blast is better at aligning similar sequences


cygwin	cmder---------------------------------------------------

others
imho cmder is better in windows than cygwin to work with unix commands


vbo	vao---------------------------------------------------

others
then sort entities by shader mapping and render using offsets in the main vbo thus minimizing shader and vao switches

is it possible to use the same vbo with more than one vao like this

i have issue with drawing big vbo with vao because the vbo has more than 65536 vertices and my vao is just uint that has maximum 65536


textwrangler	textedit---------------------------------------------------

others
textedit is not the best tool to search and replace styled text for example the free textwrangler has more powerful skills to do that


text-align	height---------------------------------------------------

others
in a two column table where both columns are set to valign top and the text is set to text-align baseline if an image exists in the first row of the second column and the image height is taller than the text itself the text in both columns is not aligned


lemmatization	stemming---------------------------------------------------

others
p the second thing is porter stemming algorithm but then i realized lemmatization is much better for my cause.

if you require that the words are still valid after this operation lemmatization will be a better solution otherwise stemming might be better because it is way faster to execute

lemmatization should lead to better results than stemming source

lemmatization is relatively more complicated as compare to stemming that is why it s harder to find some ready and free solution


2 user consider
you can also user a stemming which is a simpler version of lemmatization

2- consider stemming instead of lemmatization stemmers are much simpler smaller and usually faster than lemmatizers and for many applications their results are good enough


zlib	libpng---------------------------------------------------

others
several things i found in the cocos2d forums lead me to believe it s an issue with the zlib implementation on ios but i ve tried using both stb_image and lodepng to avoid zlib and those libraries actually performed even worse than libpng


scalaz	combinators---------------------------------------------------

others
is there a more straightforward solution with scalaz maybe with an existing combinators


membase	couchbase---------------------------------------------------

others
i d like to add that couchbase is a faster and more scalable option than couchdb the 2.0 version introduces views at a high level it s a distributed memcached membase server merged with couchdb but of course more sophisticated than just mashing them together


perf	callgrind---------------------------------------------------

others
nevertheless various profiling callgrind tool in valgrind cpu profiling google-perfutils and perf doesn t find those debugging symbols resulting in more or less useless output


set	bag---------------------------------------------------

others
i d also add that i suspect set semantics instead of bag would be more appropriate for the employee.team and team.employee properties

returning the actual set is explained with more details in the thread how to find which elements are in the bag using knapsack algorithm and not only the bag s value

take into account that lazy mappings will be disabled so it may be useful to evaluate what will be need to be set to fetchtype.eager with fetchmode.subselect if more than 1 bag is needed to be initialized with it

the inverse is adding an item to a bag can be faster than using a set because uniqueness does not have to be enforced


marathon	aurora---------------------------------------------------

others

overhead complexity capabilities
if you want to schedule basic workloads based on containers you might be better off with marathon or in the future maybe aurora

even though aurora has better capabilities i prefer marathon due to auroras complexity overhead and lack of ui for control api


skype	hangout---------------------------------------------------

others
whilst somewhat similar to skype facetime and facebook video chat google hangout focuses more on face-to-face-to-face group interaction as opposed to one-on-one video chats and utilizes sophisticated technology to seamlessly switch the focus to the person currently chatting


passenger	puma---------------------------------------------------

others
phusion passenger 4 enterprise bring many advantages over has more features than puma and rainbows for example it has out of band garbage collection can dynamically adjust the number of processes based on traffic completely automates rolling restarts so you don t need scripting etc

sergio suggested nginx + unicorn or nginx + puma but nginx + passenger which replaces unicorn puma is much easier to setup performs great uses less memory works better and has more features

same passenger + mri 2.3.0 is 3 times faster than puma + jruby on same rack app


getdate	datepart---------------------------------------------------

others
i prefer using these short forms because to me year getdate is shorter to type and better to read than datepart yyyy getdate


pseudo-class	visited---------------------------------------------------

others
active pseudo-class should go after hover otherwise the hover overwrites the order for the link-relates pseudo-clasess is link | visited | hover | active .


des	rsa---------------------------------------------------

others
des code is 8 times larger than rsa

by comparison des see section 3.2 and other block ciphers are much faster than the rsa algorithm


sip	sdp---------------------------------------------------

others
internet telephony is a lot more than sip - rtp rtcp sdp on-device audio handling etc.


directwrite	direct2d---------------------------------------------------

others
i suspect that they re bypassing gdi and using something more direct like the new directwrite and or direct2d apis


lasagne	pylearn---------------------------------------------------

others
and using keras or lasagne is way simpler to develop nns then pure theano which was just side research project in montreal to support development of pylearn


deque	multimap---------------------------------------------------

others
the map set multimap and multiset are normally implemented as binary trees with red-black balancing rules for example and deque is possibly more impression than knowledge a circular queue in an array exploiting an array-doubling or similar growth pattern


theano	lasagne---------------------------------------------------

others
it is similar in spirit to keras which is built as a high-level api on top of theano tensorflow cntk although the main difference is that lasagne implements only one backend allowing it to integrate more deeply with theano features

and using keras or lasagne is way simpler to develop nns then pure theano which was just side research project in montreal to support development of pylearn


jquery	scriptaculous---------------------------------------------------

others
scriptaculous can do what jquery provides plus more

i ended up using prototype scriptaculous which are better integrated with cakephp than jquery to manually do ajax using prototype s ajax functionality with cakephp s requesthandler to determine when to return ajax

i have used both prototype scriptaculous as well as jquery in many projects and based on what i am seeing it appears jquery has the more plug-in available so am leaning towards using jquery

i ended up using scriptaculous for most of my animations simply because it provides smoother animations and more configurable than what jquery ui provides

i also kind of get the impression that scriptaculous drag and drop is better than jquery ui drag and drop based on the online demos

it was working with scriptaculous before but we didn t decide to use that due to jquery working better for us and this is what worked before


jasmine	sinon---------------------------------------------------

others
the thing that makes sinon a better choice than jasmine spies is that it is capable of programming spies expectations withargs ... .called.

it should be mentioned that sinon provides many more features for smart stubs spies than jasmine so both can be used together


gridview	radgrid---------------------------------------------------

others
each tab contains multiple radgrids as radgrid is heavier than asp.net gridview


free	calloc---------------------------------------------------

others
in this context free store is different and incompatible with heap because the new delete free store library is simpler and quicker than the malloc free realloc calloc heap library and thus provides huge memory usage gains to the c++ embedded programmer in a context where you have only 512 bytes of ram

if you want better guarantees about zeroing or to get free zeroing on smaller allocations though it s more wasteful the closer to one page you get you can just explicitly do what malloc calloc do implicitly and use the os provided zero-ed memory replace

it takes extra time because new or calloc are much more complex than the allocation on the stack in typical machines allocating space on the stack takes 1-2 instructions above and beyond the same function with no variables at all where a call to new or can be half a dozen just for the call and the same again for delete or free and several dozen to a few thousand instructions inside those library functions - how long the code is depends largely on how it is implemented and whether the runtime has some memory available or a call into the os is required to get some more memory as well


thereâ memory earlier
secondly i notice that when i run my program i m seeing the free function call more often than the malloc calloc calls 98 to 16

how does free know how much memory to be free d which was earlier allocated by malloc or calloc

malloc free is harder because thereâ s also calloc and realloc


range	median---------------------------------------------------

others
you should also adjust your conditionals to check for a low high range as it should quickly get smaller as your median value approaches the real value

on the other hand if the number of range is smaller than log n it may be better to move elements of a given range to the beginning of the array and use a linear time selection algorithm to find the median


invokelater	invokeandwait---------------------------------------------------

others

components bet thread
you can use eventqueue.invokelater to switch to the swing thread and back greenfoot isn t designed to support this but it should work anyway -- invokelater is a better bet than invokeandwait

you can simply create a new thread runnable or futuretask to run on an executor and call invokeandwait only when necessary to update components but if you can get away with it invokelater is better


traceroute	packets---------------------------------------------------

others
traceroute proceeds unless all three sent packets are lost more than twice then the connection is lost and the route cannot be evaluated

that will give you the average rtt for each hop small sample obviously you would want to adjust traceroute to send more packets to each hop for more complete average


lapack	magma---------------------------------------------------

others
b magma runs always slower than lapack sequential around 10 times slower


jtextpane	jeditorpane---------------------------------------------------

others
jtextpane is more high level as jeditorpane strange naming


clearinterval	settimeout---------------------------------------------------

others
my solution was to increase the settimeout to create a bigger delay before the next part of the script commenced but also to add an additional clearinterval as the top line of the script running within the setinterval

as for me settimeout is simpler than setinterval in this case as you won t need to clearinterval in the end of the array


bufferedreader	bufferedwriter---------------------------------------------------

others
i have coded a routine to compute the cartesian product of different tables as in a database with the only exception that the tables are stored as files in my case and for computing the cartesian product i am using file i o for reading files i am using filereader coupled with bufferedreader and for writing files i am using filewriter coupled with bufferedwriter now as i am performing every computation externally in files i.e i compute the product as follows i take a row from file-1 which is table-1 in my case and concatenate it with every other row in file-2 which is table-2 in my case and write it to an external file which holds the result


inline-functions	inlining---------------------------------------------------

others
i m well aware that inline is more of compiler decision than of user going so far as even to inlining non-specified inline-functions so the user control is almost negligible

compilers are getting better with inlining the use of function pointers where the function is actually known but contemporary compilers certainly don t always inline-functions calls through function pointers even if all the context would be there

using options such as -os for the compiler to tell it to make the code small in other words don t inline-functions unless the code is shorter by inlining than by calling the function and don t unroll loops etc etc - but do inline-functions called only once as that does make the code shorter


multiplication	exponent---------------------------------------------------

slower int powers
as int exponent gets larger taking powers might be faster than multiplication

if the exponent is 0.5 you should use sqrt and if the exponent is a small integer 2 3 4 expressing the formula with multiplication is faster but less readable

however with really very small parameter 2 in your case exponent is faster than multiplication

however naive multiplication will get slower and slower as the exponent increases

the misunderstanding is that incrementing the exponent is not faster than doing a multiplication

this is analogous to the way you can compute exponent using successive squaring much faster than by repeated multiplication


others
note that the exponent operator has a higher precedence than multiplication and division just like in mathematics

multiplication is even easier as you dont have to line up the decimal points you just do the math on the significant digits and simply add the exponent

so ideally i want to have approximate relative times of elementary operations execution like multiplication typically takes 5 times more time than addition exponent is about 100 multiplication

in addition since all my coefficients are positive and i only want the x qth one is there a way to get mathematica to discard all exponent that are larger than that and not do all the multiplication with those

it will be much slower i don t have benchmarks but i would guess at least an order of magnitude maybe more decimal will not benefit from any hardware acceleration and arithmetic on it will require relatively expensive multiplication division by powers of 10 which is far more expensive than multiplication and dividion by powers of 2 to match the exponent before addition subtraction and to bring the exponent back into range after multiplication division


ember.js	sproutcore---------------------------------------------------

others
i have seen a lot of post where they are claiming that ember.js is much better than sproutcore but looking at the differences i have seen that the widget support is not there in ember.js


archetypes	dexterity---------------------------------------------------

others
variety of supporting widgets is probably the single area in which archetypes is still stronger than dexterity

admittedly mrbob doesn t yet have the number of plugins that zopeskel does but since archetypes has been overtaken by dexterity there is less heavy boilerplate code to generate

dexterity arguably has more better documentation than archetypes see plone.org products dexterity as well as my book professional plone 4 development

the good news is that dexterity content types are more lightweight than archetypes content types and doing raw listing by iterating over folder.contentitems in your template should not be that expensive


scylla	cassandra---------------------------------------------------

others
scylla a cassandra clone which is generally more efficient than cassandra also has similar issues with huge partitions as in cassandra moderately large partitions are fine but these issues are actively being worked on including re-designing the file format so eventually scylla should support arbitrary-sized partitions

i wrote a detailed description of the sstable format on scylla s site scylla is a more efficient c++ re-implementation of cassandra to which i contribute


octal	binary---------------------------------------------------

practice human ways
hex and octal are just shorter ways to write binary

with a little practice hex or octal are easier for a human than binary

the conversion between binary and either octal or hex is even easier than decimal


others
because hexadecimal and rarely octal literals are more compact and people using them usually can convert between hexadecimal and binary faster than deciphering a binary number

that number cannot be larger than binary 111 which is equal to 7 in both decimal and octal

you ll need to convert binary to another base here i use decimal when writing this code because c doesn t have binary constants which would be ten times more useful than octal constants

when converting from binary to octal it s more easy each 3 bits give you 1 digit in octal


paperclip	fog---------------------------------------------------

others
i have found though that since i started using the asset_sync gem which uses fog instead of aws-s3 gem i don t have any more trouble with paperclip and s3


profiling	instrumentation---------------------------------------------------

others
in addition to instrumentation which i also use heavily to profiling my apps is the xamarin profiling to gain more insights of what is still alive and keeps some references

tracing profiling are slower but more accurate they also require that the program be changed the instrumentation process which could potentially introduce bugs not that i have heard of it happening.

you need to profiling your app in instrumentation to get more detail - there s a button right there in your screenshot

in my experience normal execution on iphone is much faster than profiling with instrumentation

i guess profiling might need more permissions so it can reflect instrumentation

personally i find shark more useful than instrumentation for profiling my code and finding out what s taking up time when it matters

paulw11 s comment helped--the time profiling template is better suited for this task than the system trace instrumentation

if you re writing a mac app the opengl profiling tool profiling opengl code better than instrumentation

so my question is beyond instrumentation and the profiling using memory leaks which tells you the location of creation of the leaky object but not the root cause are there any other tools i could run that could give me any more info than instrumentation re tracking down the root cause point

this is due to the fact that profiling need to instrumentation the code to keep track of invocations - this can interfere with the jit s ability to inline those methods and the instrumentation overhead becomes significantly larger than the time spent actually executing the methods body


bluetooth	usb---------------------------------------------------

others
normally bluetooth buffers are smaller than tcp or usb buffers so you don t want to overload them

it depends on your requirements but setting up a usb connection is sometimes easier than managing a bluetooth connection

i had previously sent those commands via bluetooth but the connection fails too often to be useful and is slower than usb

interfacing with usb is more difficult than it sounds it would be harder to build something which would interface with that and measure millivolts than with bluetooth because the pic processor you use for analog to digital sampling and usb client would in fact have to either act as usb host or usb otg on a phone which is far more complicated than being a usb peripheral

if your watch doesn t have usb support moto 360 and other induction only charging you need to enable bluetooth debugging slower than through usb though

i am specifically trying to connect it via usb serial as the device needs to be mounted unattended and bluetooth connection seems less reliable plus extra cost for bluetooth capabilities on the device so potentially more cost effective over usb serial


megabytes reliable connectivity
wifi and bluetooth aren t fast enough for a smooth framerate but the data transfer speed across the usb connector is more than enough up to 480 megabytes second

on the other hand a usb connection is far more reliable better supported and of course has the inherent advantage of speed and since it is well supported does not suffer from all the pitfalls bluetooth connectivity does


atoi	atof---------------------------------------------------

others
as pointed out by n.m in the comments atof takes a float as input - the fibonacci sequence is generated using an int so atoi is more appropriate


d3.js	protovis---------------------------------------------------

others
the result is that using d3.js can feel a little lower-level - you have more control but you have to be pretty familiar with svg syntax to do some of the things protovis does much more easily

finally i haven t done much with animation but i think you re entirely correct - d3.js provides more animation support than protovis especially in terms of animated transitions

i m new to protovis although it is no longer under development and d3.js is the newer software

the team behind protovis has since created d3.js so this is likely a better option than protovis

for semantic zooming you ll notice that d3.js is significantly faster than protovis


fish	bash---------------------------------------------------

others
gnu bash zsh fish have more features so are more complex


mp3	ogg---------------------------------------------------

legal files bitrate
mp3 files were of higher bitrate and when converted to ogg ended up in the loss of quality which resulted in the noise

ogg vorbis is better quality per meg than mp3 plus no licensing legal issues


others
i have done it by using ogg files instead of using mp3 files in my application ogg files consumes less amount of memory

i think there are some devices that could have issues with mp3 files has they haven t the mp3 chip decoder so the best option it s ogg files also ogg usually compress better

of those three ogg would usually be smaller than mp3

i originally had the all sounds in mp3 format but after reading that ogg may be more reliable i converted them all to ogg but the errors appeared just the same

however after attempting multiple times i m actually getting worse results with ogg files than i am with mp3 s - but the problem is the opposite ie when the loop is supposed to go back to the start of the ogg file it actually seems to start again but from about 2 or 3 seconds into it ie no gap it just doesn t loop correctly

stream mp3 mp2 mp1 ogg wav aiff custom generated and more via


html5 icecast performance
moreover ogg vorbis is better then mp3 at all bitrates

firefox doesn t support mp3 on html5 they support ogg which is better anyway

if you want to cover the largest audience possible set up a streaming server like icecast and broadcast over mp3 and or ogg both is better

first of all i recommend you to use ogg instead of mp3 has better performance

in general ogg achieves better compression than mp3 which is a plus for things like download size bandwidth resource usage etc


visualvm	yourkit---------------------------------------------------

others
one option is to use visualvm however a commercial profiler like yourkit may handle larger memory sizes better

i prefer yourkit as i find it easier than visualvm


boost	allocator---------------------------------------------------

idinfo boost_1_49_0 map
tmp ccnqebjm.o in function boost program_options detail common_config_file_iterator common_config_file_iterator std set std allocator std less std allocator std allocator std allocator const bool

boost serialization extended_type_info_typeid std __1 allocator std __1 basic_string std __1 allocator std __1 less std __1 allocator std __1 allocator std __1 allocator const std __1 basic_string std __1 allocator extended_type_info_typeid in teee-a553d7.o

others
boost intrusive_ptr performs better than shared_ptr because it doesn t need a second allocator to hold the reference count

the latter doesn t do any dynamic memory allocator and is more than 10 times faster than std to_string on boost karma benchmarks

using specialized boost interprocess allocator to make better use of the shared memory area

the boost pool library provides stl allocator that are more efficient when allocator objects of the same type as opposed to std allocator which simply uses new and delete

to be able to use std allocate_shared with boost fast_pool_allocator as the allocator method using g++ 4.8 or higher with boost 1.56.0

i think that the boost manual could have explained how the allocator is used more explicitly

just to goof off a version using boost string_ref is much faster still due the reduced allocator


3des	aes---------------------------------------------------

older aes-ni cpu
aes can be even much faster than des or 3des when the cpu supports aes-ni

if aes is negotiated it s faster than des and 3des used by default by older applications


others
according to this analysis aes rijndael-128 is more than twice as fast as des 3des with a bigger key size more secure

furthermore 3des is much slower than aes

3des is more expensive than aes for example

edit 3des is better than des in the sense that it s significantly more secure but still less secure than aes but its performance is of necessity significantly worse than aes des or twofish because you re essentially applying des three times


secure observations obsolete
you re using des in your example which is a flawed and obsolete algorithm alternatively use 3des so i suggest moving to aes which provides better encryption

des is the least secure 3des is better but i d go for the aes

how ever if you insist to use some api in java i have to say that des is really old way to encrypted text 3des desede or aes will be better and safer both of them have already been supported since java6

if you used aes then you might see a better speedup over the des 3des observations


junit	easymock---------------------------------------------------

others
so using easymock with junit should give you better coverage and better tests than junit alone


fgets	getchar---------------------------------------------------

others
use fgets instead of getchar to retrieve more than one character


ppm	tga---------------------------------------------------

others
you could use the tga format which is more common than ppm and allows true grayscale images


websocket	pusher---------------------------------------------------

others
the underlying websocket technology is bidirectional more info here but pusher s pub sub model is unidirectional


unicode	ucs---------------------------------------------------

others
according to wikipedia the bmp of the ucs has 65536 characters the latest version of unicode contains more than 107000 characters and the ucs has more than one million code points


nsexception	nserror---------------------------------------------------

others
nserror is generally used to pass information between different code interfaces that are expecting a possible error where as nsexception is more so for errors that are unexpected or caused by the developer and thus should be handled during development

aside from obejctive-c convention and best practices nserror is much more robust and flexibly than nsexception and allows the caller to effectively ignore the problem if they want to


hash	whirlpool---------------------------------------------------

others
at best it is a computationally expensive hash function like whirlpool that for example is five times slower than md5 and thus allows only a fifth of the number of hash operations in opposite to md5

if you want longer hash lets call more secure you should use something like sha512 whirlpool etc


mouseover	mouseenter---------------------------------------------------

others
the mouseenter event is usually a better choice than mouseover

i have a problem with my code i already make a code with mouseover but it was very slow to display per row my picture edit so i read that mouseenter is faster i hope because i have normaly 2000 row


multiple alternative use
it should also be noted that mouseenter and mouseleave work somewhat differently and usually much better than mouseover and mouseout

imho mouseenter and mouseleave are much more reliable than mouseover and mouseout which tend to flicker

in this case mouseenter mouseleave has better behaviour and prevents bubbling compared to mouseover mouseout

i have no idea about the classes but i think mouseenter and mouseleave are better alternative for mouseout and mouseover

because jquery doesn t use mouseover and mouseout it uses mouseenter and mouseleave which are more suited to this scenario

also you might want to use mouseenter and mouseleave which are sanitized by jquery and are a little more reliable than mouseover and mouseout

mouseover events can occur multiple times so mouseenter is a better option for this

this may make for various race conditions and may necessitate using events which give you earlier notification than mouseup mousedown mouseenter mouseleave mouseover mouseout

also instead of mouseover and mouseout use the better ones mouseenter and mouseleave or simply the .hover method


datalist	repeater---------------------------------------------------

others
this can be done in a repeater but a datalist control is more straightforward and is just as easy to use

repeater is more light than datalist as datalist creates the view by creating a table whereas repeater doesn t

you might have better luck with a repeater a datalist or a datagrid


roboguice	robolectric---------------------------------------------------

others
you cannot use mocks in conjunction with roboguice it s better to let robolectric provide the context you need here


uiview	caanimation---------------------------------------------------

others
uiview animation is generally easier and more intuitive to use than caanimation


qcheckbox	qtreeview---------------------------------------------------

others
i need show files from qfilesystemmodel in qtreeview and customize that tree to show one more column with qcheckbox so user can pick 0..n files from that qtreeview


django-userena	pinax---------------------------------------------------

others
i was thinking of using the accounts app but django-userena seems better so i created a project zero with pinax and tried to integrate django-userena with it


strncmp	strcmp---------------------------------------------------

others
i could see only one advantage that strncmp will take slightly less time to execute than strcmp as we will always compare prefix of string to comapre rather than entire string

strncmp is more secure than strcmp

note also the functions strncmp and memcmp which are similar to strcmp but are safer

is strcmp slower than strncmp as one can give pre-calculated string length to it but strcmp does not receive such information

the only case where strncmp would be safer than strcmp is when you re comparing two character arrays as strings you re certain that both arrays are at least n bytes long the 3rd argument passed to strncmp and you re not certain that both arrays contain strings contain a 0 null character terminator


bit note strings
but even in that approach i always prefer to use the safer strncmp than strcmp

strncmp is a little bit safer than strcmp because you specify how many comparisons will be made at most

note strncmp is safer than strcmp

in few words strncmp is safer then strcmp but it is slower too

you should use strncmp to compare your strings it s safer than strcmp

also have a look at strncmp which is safer version of strcmp


prop	each---------------------------------------------------

others
needless to say each product has more than one prop which is kept in the producthas table


qgridlayout	qwidget---------------------------------------------------

others
however the qwidget gauge1 is always bigger than the other one.i want to use a qgridlayout because the application has to work on different sizes of a screen

in this case parent is the parent qwidget upon which the qgridlayout mentioned earlier is installed


implements	extends---------------------------------------------------

note methods baseadapter
note extends mouseadapter is easier since you only need to implements the methods you want to handle

second in order to add or update the value of listview in general extends arrayadapter is much easier than implements baseadapter because of arrayadapter support add remove insert method by itself


others
but that seems a lot uglier than implements a facade pattern and just extends the map code but that is a lot of intermediate code to create a facade for

and i write extends midlet implements command listener amm it doesn t work am dont get any bug and if i copy all my code and i paste it in a new project midlet and i delete all it has and i paste my code it does work mmm always and when the name was for default hellomidlet i just watch two things.

more or less the same thing as the accepted answer can be implements more succinctly by extends the gridviewpager like this

the current example is a bit choppy in rendering which may be okay for you but if not you will need to extends the already obscene number of media queries that are driving it it would likely be much easier to implements using less or sass

the extends keyword is more general in this sense since it s used to mean that the generic type could either extends another class or implements an interface

extends makes more sense to me here than implements maybe it s a typo in the book

a possible reason is that extends represents a a stronger relationship than implements although both represent is a or is a type of relationships

mvc is the most extensible and if you are familiar with how things work under the covers you ll probably be better off than implements a hard to extends ms thing like odata and wcf

implements gives larger errors because i tried with extends

where application authentication authenticationservice is nothing more than an extends of the zend authentication service and implements the identityproviderinterface

this is kind-of the functionality you for instance see but you instantly already see that there it s called at an instance and the fact it requires to extends rather then implements pdostatement has more to do with the c-level implementation functionality of that class

before we move on i just wanted to mention that spring oauth2 already provides an implementation for the above interface meaning that we could make our life a lot easier by actually extends the only implementation of the above interface clientdetails which is org.springframework.security.oauth2.provider.client.baseclientdetails rather than implements it from the beginning leverage all that can be done from baseclientdetails and add our own custom fields hence the myclientdetails looks as follow then

you can make your life easier by extends each of the components you use to a custom component that either implements its own event but then always the same event like contentchanged or takes a java 8 consumer function that is called whenever the content changes

plain chars having unspecified signed-ness allows compilers to select whichever representation is more efficient for the target architecture on some architectures zero extends a one-byte value to the size of int requires less operations thus making plain chars unsigned while on others the instruction set makes sign-extending more natural and plain chars gets implements as signed

are there some solutions available to extends asp.net identity better than implements a custom solution as suggested in the links

here is how gcc does it it sign extends if the integer type is larger than the pointer type this ll happen regardless of the integer being signed or unsigned just because that s how gcc decided to implements it

is implements the rawcomparator that much faster than extends writablecomparator

but if you d like to extends this api to be used by the external services then you ll be in a much better position with implements oauth 2.0 using doorkeeper because you can easily configure for example a authorization code grant for them

although extends by nothing is valid typescript it would seem to me that in this case implements would be more appropriate


better mealhistoryactivity sense
i have not found a lot of times when implements an interface would be a better system than extends a superclass

i have read that implements runnable is better than extends thread but i have no idea of how

public class mealhistoryactivity extends activity implements connectioncallbacks onconnectionfailedlistener locationlistener ..

why is implements runnable a better option than extends from thread class

i also know implements runable is better than extends thread

but whether or not your use an anonymous class is orthogonal to the question of whether implements runnable or extends thread is the better mechanism to define your thread task

they say that implements runnable is more preferrable than extends thread

i switched a thread from extends thread to implements runnable implements runnable is better practice right

we can either extends thread which will implicitly implements runnable but then we can t extends any other class so implements runnable is better approch

if your goal is education and not ease of implementation you would probably be better served by extends the uicomponent class and using the treeitemrenderer code as a reference to create a class that implements the same interfaces

when you extends you incorporate the code of the superclass into yours sometimes there is no code to incorporate so implements is better suited

implements runnable is better because you can extends other classes

however rather than extends actionlistener as in your second example you ll probably find that putting the listener implementation into a different class even an inner class which implements actionlistener provides better logical logical separation of your code

which i think makes sense because extends from a class should take higher priority than implements from an interface


srt	subtitle---------------------------------------------------

ass options features
srt is simpler than ass but lacks features so you may need to use the force_style option in the subtitle filter

ass supports more formatting options but srt is a simpler format and can be modified with the force_style option in the subtitle filter


others

jruby	rubinius---------------------------------------------------

others
again we see the pattern of it getting faster during the first two runs after which it settles somewhere in between slightly faster than yarv and the other jruby and slightly slower than rubinius

nb that jruby macruby and rubinius have more advanced gc s

in practice this means that deploying a rails app to jruby is a good idea as is running your integration tests but for developer unit tests and scripts mri yarv or rubinius are better choices


queue	fifo---------------------------------------------------

others
true fifo message ordering longer delays and so on but sadly smaller message sizes. push queue allow you to set up push subscribers which then receive an http post any time a new message is put onto the queue

i don t know how fast do you want to process the messages but if you need to have a real fifo don t allow azure s queue to get more than one message at a time

yes because the queue is implemented as a fifo one which is sent earlier is on the front part of the queue thus leaving sooner

as emphasized these new fifo sqs queue provide more options to cover the use case at hand but are not yet available in all sqs regions initially only in us east ohio and us west oregon

as of jquery 1.5 the fail and done and as of jquery 1.6 always callback hooks are fifo managed queue allowing for more than one callback for each hook

a queue is defined much more abstractly it has to support a couple of specific operations adding and retrieving items and an order relationship between the two fifo


imagemagick	minimagick---------------------------------------------------

others
based on my own experience i would look into a gem like minimagick which provides a nice interface to imagemagick which is a more common library for the tasks you re trying to do


gridview	checkboxlist---------------------------------------------------

others
since you re presenting multiple columns a gridview control is a better alternative to checkboxlist


clgeocoder	mkreversegeocoder---------------------------------------------------

others
in ios 5.0 and later you can use clgeocoder of core location framework as for ios lower than 5.0 mkreversegeocoder of map kit framework


onchange	onkeydown---------------------------------------------------

others
onkeydown although it wouldn t work for pasted data where onchange is probably better


cos	sqrt---------------------------------------------------

others
in term of speed square rooting is easy a few arithmetical operations for some newton-like method but it is not clear what asin does probably quite costly cos is likely to be one order of magnitude slower than sqrt and thus one square root is likely to be quickier than those two transcendental function calls


better approach 1-sin
if i want to calculate a sin and a cos is it cheaper to calculate a sin and a cos or calculate a sin then a sqrt 1-sin 2 to get the cos

the jni sincos is better than computing sin and cos but the sqrt approach is still faster

an two for a function like sqrt i could probably write my own constexpr but something like sin or cos would be trickier so is there away around it


rsa	aes---------------------------------------------------

secure
how is aes less secure than rsa in this scenario

asymmetric key encryption ex rsa is no more secure than symmetric key encryption ex aes

asymmetric encryption ex rsa is no more secure than symmetric encryption ex aes


slower faster algorithm
rsa is not ment for bulk encryption as it s quit slow compared to symmetric algorithms like aes it s more than a factor of 1000 slower

rsa is much slower than aes

execution of aes is more faster than rsa for same key sizes

like you heard asymmetric cryptography like rsa is much slower than symmetric cryptography aes but it does have it s advantages simpler key management a single private key to protect

it shows that rsa encrypt is faster then aes encrypt

the aes key is encrypting much more data but is much faster than rsa encryption

rsa will be slower than a symmetric cypher like rijndael or aes

one of the reasons to do so is that rsa is much slower than for example aes

you could use rsa but a symmetric algorithm like aes is faster if you can find a way to exchange keys in a secure way

if you want the entire communication to be secure not only sending username password you can use a symmetric cipher algorithm aes because asymmetric cipher algorithms rsa are much slower and consume more resources

so the 115 seconds will be reduced to 3-4 secs plus the encryption decryption time used for aes which is much faster than rsa


others
note however that doing so means that each encrypted chunk has its own padding and that rsa is much more computationally expensive than aes

that is actually not the case with rsa which is --- more so than aes --- just a math equation

in your particular case an rsa key of 2048 bits has a lot less strenght than an aes key of 256 bits

i want to encrypt decrypt a long file with rsa i know aes is better but this is just for a comparison in openssl libcrypto

you could for example generate a random aes key encrypt it using rsa and store it in the output file and then encrypt the file itself with aes which is much faster and doesn t have any problem with large inputs

while 256-bit aes might sound less secure than 4096-bit rsa they might actually be quite similar from the offered protection

block crypto algorithms like aes do suffer from this problem too but without a pki aes is no less safe than rsa

the whole purpose of using aes to secure the communication or any symmetric key encryption is that it s a lot faster than rsa or any public key encryption

this is one of the caveats of rsa which is why things like aes are better suited for longer streams like files

algorithms like rsa are much less user-friendly than aes

if the message you re encrypting is large enough not only will it take more time to process but the rsa encrypted message might be larger than an rsa encrypted aes key plus an aes encrypted message

considering most rsa moduli are at least 1024 bit this will be much larger than an aes key

as far as efficiency rsa is going to be orders of magnitudes slower than aes so the trade-off you make is that you give up simplicity you give up the simplicity of using aes in favor of some rsa chunking in return for poor performance you get the slower performance of rsa.


performance resource technical
there are two reasons for that performance aes is faster then rsa and resources aes is less resource hungry than rsa

and regarding your first question it is definitely possible to encrypt decrypt messages directly using rsa there are only technical and performance reasons aes is much faster than rsa why rsa is used only to encrypt a session key and aes is used to encrypt decrypt the messages themselves


public bit small
but if you use public key encryption to encrypt messages you are a limited to small messages -- a 1024 bit rsa key encrypts less than 128 bytes and b going to pay in performance because public key encryption is much more costly than symmetric key encryption such as aes encryption

generally public key algorithms rsa need much larger keys than symmetric key algorithms aes because they rely on different mathematical properties


mspec	nspec---------------------------------------------------

others
you ll find that the simplest mspec tests are simpler in nspec


installation	upgrade---------------------------------------------------

versioning different msi
upgrade code must be the same product code must be different and installation versioning must be larger in either first second or third number

when you install a msi with abovementioned settings msi will check if any other product installed with same upgrade code if it finds a product then it will check if the new installation has a higher versioning


others
on ubuntu 12 04 the kernel must be upgrade and docker installation is more difficult

does an eclipse installation perform slower after the upgrade

you probably have authored upgrade of your install incorrectly in some way so every time you tested your installation you were adding more references to the guids tied to these registry keys

downsides are that you have to digitally sign the application assemblies and clickonce manifest so clickonce can verify the upgrade and replace the older versioning instead of creating a brand new installation clickonce only installs into a user-specific app directory not into the all users program files directory and you cannot have any user-customizable install settings like installing various components or sidechaining additional package installs besides prerequisites

you should be able to share the system directory across all of your ci installation providing a central place for upgrade and using less disk space

as for production side of things upgrading your database in transaction msi-style installation is much better than attempting to upgrade at each app startup since you can potentially end up with desynchronized database-application versioning

as the versioning of the ase in the dumped database will likely be older than the versioning of ase you are installing to do the restore you will technically be doing a database upgrade so you will want to review the installation documentation regarding upgrading databases

this can enable the user to download an upgrade patch that is much smaller than the installation package for the entire product


equals	compareto---------------------------------------------------

others
i am using the min value because i read that the compareto method returns negative 0 or positive whether the first string is less than equals to or greater than the second

compareto defines whether your base student is greater than less than or equals to your studenttocompare and you can define these with any criteria you please

when one of the strings is a prefix of another the performance of compareto is worse as it still needs to determine the lexicographical ordering while equals won t worry any more and return false immediately

and my guess as to why an element is being dropped is your compareto method never returns a 1 in any case so elements are always considered to be less than or equals to other elements which is probably screwing with the treeset

implementing icomparable is a more fine-grain way of comparison as it provides the compareto method which is a greater-than less-than comparison as opposed to equals which is simply a is-equal-or-not comparison

compareto returns a number that is less than equals to or greater than zero corresponding to the first string being before the same as or after the second string respectively

put your greater than equals to and less than logic in compareto

if this works it seems that u are still comparing the strings in your ordered list and u should now check if the return value of compareto is less grater equals to 0

all i changed was the first compareto comparison to be less than instead of less than or equals to

equals can be more efficient then compareto

most likely hashcode will be faster unless for whatever reason calling hashcode + equals once is much slower than calling compareto log n times

implementing the equals and the compareto methods sounds easier than it sometimes really is

note that equals takes into account decimal positions so compareto is safer


values comparison bigger
according to javadoc compareto needs to return a negative integer zero or a positive integer as this object is less than equals to or greater than the specified object

compareto method returns a negative integer zero or a positive integer as this object is less than equals to or greater than the specified object

icomparable declares the compareto method which returns an integer that specifies a less than equals to or greater than relationship between two objects of the same type

is a generic type at compile time java will require that an instance provide an implementation of int compareto t o which from the javadoc returns a negative integer zero or a positive integer as this object is less than equals to or greater than the specified object

or is it compareto returns negative numbers 0 and positive numbers respectively indicating whether the calling object is less than equals to or greater than the specified object

the interface defines one method compareto that must return a negative integer zero or a positive integer if this object is less than equals to or greater than the other object respectively

if compareto returns a negative int it means less than 0 means equals 1 means greater than

it s not clear to me what you want but i ll mention that the date class also has a compareto method which can be used to determine with one call if two date objects are equals or if they aren t equals which occurs sooner

you should be using compareto method for less than or equals or greater than

the only significance of a compareto return value is if it is greater less than or equals to zero

note that in both cases you can take advantage of the fact that int also implements so you can use its compareto method to determine whether corresponding values in each instance of your class are less than equals to or greater than each other

the compareto method returns 1 0 or -1 depending on whether value a is respectively greater than equals to or lesser than value b

in the compareto method you can decide which fields are used for the comparison greater less than or equals

i am using the compareto method in java to try and check if a certain date is greater than or equals than 24 hours after another date

in the compareto method you can then write the code which will call the getters for the year month and so on until it figures out whether the current object is less than equals to or greater than the object o being passed into the compareto method

compareto returns a negative integer zero or a positive integer as this object is less than equals to or greater than the specified object

per the page i linked to compareto returns a negative integer zero or a positive integer as this object is less than equals to or greater than the specified object.

implement compareto in temporary temporary.compareto left such that it returns a negative integer zero or a positive integer as temporary is less than equals to or greater than the left

this interface defines the method compareto t which will return a negative number zero or a positive number if the first object is less than equals to or greater than the other one respectively

we can call its compareto method to decide whether it is bigger than equals to or less than any int

with this rather than needing to implement a comparator all you need to implement is the int compareto class o method in the class which returns a negative integer zero or a positive integer as this object is less than equals to or greater than the specified object.

compareto return a negative integer zero or a positive integer as this object is less than equals to or greater than the specified object

you need to call the compareto method which will indicate the result of the comparison by returning an integer less than greater than or equals to 0

i know that in java there is a compareto method that you can write in a class that will compare two variables and return a value -1 1 or 0 signifing greater than less than and equals to operations

compareto compares values and returns an int which tells if the values compare less than equals or greater than

the compareto method returns one of -1 0 1 depending on whether or not the argument is less than equals to or greater than respectively


implements	modifiers---------------------------------------------------

others
why the access modifiers for the getter setter is more restrictive has in my opinion something to do with easier implements interfaces which always have implicitly public properties


sorting	grouping---------------------------------------------------

others
but if you are sorting and only want the top row then a max or min and a grouping be more straight forward

your desired output does not reflect what you have as input if you want to grouping common sublists you can use itertools.groupby considering you want sorted output using a dict and then sorting makes less sense than just creating the grouping from the sorted list using groupby

but then sorting by age grouping ak is more difficult i think

make the excludes annotation more legibile by sorting the different parameters into different grouping

grouping is certainly possible with itertools.groupby but that would require sorting making that less performant compared to a defaultdict plus loop solution

on myisam tables in some cases the subselects tend to be faster than grouping by queries due to the fact that grouping by in myisam is quite expensive due to sorting materialization overhead

when using sorted comparator on the stream before the collect operation the stream has to buffer the entire stream contents to be able to sort it and the sorting may involve much more data movement within that buffer compared to sorting the smaller lists of the grouping afterwards

both have the effect of the order by not being executed at all -- and so not executed after the grouping by in the first case the effect is to remove sorting from the grouping by and in the second the effect is to do nothing more than the grouping by already does

sorting rdd by a key sort within a grouping will have not more than 100 records in that grouping

grouping has looser constraints than sorting so in theory it could be marginally faster than sorting but unless you re dealing with a lot of data you re unlikely to see a speed difference

if the database is sophisticated enough adding an explicit order by clause will hint that sorting is more optimal for the grouping operation as well as the sorting can then be re-used in the query execution pipeline

sorting criteria function simply checks if the count field of the first grouping is greater than the other

in some cases where table data was uniquely identifying i used intermediate tables and frequency distribution sorting to eliminate things like uncommon names eliminated instances where a count with grouping by was less than or equal to 2


values faster
when not sorting before grouping it is much faster but then i get values from random parts of hour

in my experience hashing is always faster than sorting for joining and for grouping


efficient linq order
of course ordering could be forced obj.gettype .tostring and using lexical order but since a strict order is not necessary only grouping i was wondering if there s a more efficient way than sorting

does linq use any sorting or other mechanisms to make a grouping join more efficient so it doesn t have to loop through an entire collection for every unmatched item

alter how i am joining the tables together so that the sorting of the results for the grouping by is more efficient and then hopefully remove the tmp table as well

first sort the dataframe by time this should be more efficient than sorting each grouping by time


columns better int
instead knowing that we want to grouping by these columns we can make the application code to do so simpler by sorting by these fields

this way only a single int column needs to be sorted grouping which performs much better than sorting two text columns


faster rest index
apparently groupby with count and sorting the grouping was noticeably faster with sparksql

the reason being that sorting less elements which the grouping generally produces is going to be faster than sorting all input documents

so i started thinking that sorting would be faster if i created an index on the column that i plan to always sort on even if the rest of my query is missing where grouping by having etc


free	strcpy---------------------------------------------------

others
additionally if you have strdup then it is much more convenient than strlen + malloc + strcpy with identical result including the same obligation to free the allocated storage when you no longer need it


maven-antrun-plugin	pom.xml---------------------------------------------------

others
i found a workaround and then manually unpack with maven-antrun-plugin but my pom.xml looked better without those additional 15 lines.


backgrounding	multitasking---------------------------------------------------

others
btw multitasking is really more fast switching than backgrounding in ios.


ordinals	difference---------------------------------------------------

others
the difference between the maximum and minimum value of the set of ordinals dates is one more than the length of the set


width	font-size---------------------------------------------------

others
this means that font-size is more comparable to height than it is to width

in this way you force font-size for all elements containing a paragraph p inside a generic col-xs class col-xs-6 col-xs-3 specifically an only when screen width is lower than typical screen width used by xs suffix of bootstrap classes

keep on lowering the font-size until the span s width is less than the fixed width

the first media query says that if the screen width is less than 992px the h2 in the item class should have a font-size of 3rem should be red and should have an underline

in order to keep the date nicely fit across the width of the screen i decided to dynamically let the font-size change whenever the string changes in width may is wider than jul


total exact time
you can then check if the width of the text is greater than 800px and reduce the font-size until the width is less than or equal to

when you are using fittext at that time if the font-size is greater than 100px than you have to set the exact width as per your font-size

that is repeatedly reduce the font-size by 5 until the total width is less than or equal to 800px

if the width is greater than the fixed width bump the font-size down and then check the width again


fonts obs string
the only font-size is on the body tag but what happens is that the div is square but the button has a smaller height than its width

if width of text element is bigger than width of container decrease font-size by some value for example by 0.1px and go to step 3

i initialize the loop with this value and increment the font-size with 1 until the string is wider than the width of the containing element

that being said using viewport units for font-size in the above way is problematic because when the viewport width is much smaller - say 320px - then the rendered font size will become 0.03 x 320 9.6px which is very too small

obs the font-size must be dynamic having text height limited by container height when container width is larger than text width and limited by container width when container width is smaller then text width

from there on the width slowly increases again as the part of the string still on line 1 linearly gets wider as the font-size increases

you can remove the transform s and the margin-left and add a width set as 0 here smaller than the font-size 16px here to the get the effect

as it fit for device but as font-size increase in both width and height so fonts and elements were messing up because font-size was bigger with respect to width

determine if the span s width is greater than the useable width of the input element and update the font-size accordingly

once the clone s width is less than or equal to the input element s width we delete the clone element and set the input s font-size

if you dont want to crop the image at all or use javascript i think your only choice is to force the text element to have the same proportions as the image with width approximately being 50 larger than height and then adjust the font-size text elements to fit the container

as you can see the font-size of the text is bit larger than the width of the noisy lines

i ve also experimented with the line-height also when decreasing both height and line-height to 1 px the added height gets worse and font-size i ve put the height and width as attributes instead of inline css a div inside the td etc


folderbrowserdialog	openfiledialog---------------------------------------------------

others
assuming your solution is winforms and your user is selecting a directory i m not sure how to interpret your use of path -- the file s path or a path to a directory a folderbrowserdialog might be more appropriate than a openfiledialog as it allows you to choose the folder directly


jtextfield	jlabel---------------------------------------------------

others
because copying text result from jtextfield is always easier than retyping it from jlabel note that jlabel is not focusable

jtextfield is more than 1 line height and jlabel is not in left side


imagemagick	libjpeg---------------------------------------------------

others
basically imagemagick was only slightly slower than libjpeg


integer	unsigned---------------------------------------------------

implementation promotions size
furthermore signed integer types just tend to be more useful than unsigned types

as far as the compiler is concerned the conversion from integer 0 to unsigned int is no better than the conversion from integer 0 to pointer

if the native integer size was smaller than 64-bit you could use the same theory but you d have to loop over the array sizeof cachedarr sizeof unsigned int times

integer types both signed and unsigned which are strictly narrower than an int are converted to a signed int

it might even be bigger than any integer type but if there is some integer type which is the right size and you that integer type will be typedef d to intptr_t and its unsigned version probably more useful will be uintptr_t

both of following types are semantically equivalent minimum 64bit integer without sign and with equal or bigger size than unsigned long int

as we move to 64-bit platforms the unsigned range of a signed integer should be more than enough for most purposes

an implementation that has no such unsigned type say because pointers are bigger than any integer type won t provide it

an unsigned 64-bit integer type requires compiler support which your compiler lacks so you cannot create it sorry

instead default argument promotions take place which means that any integer type smaller than int unsigned int gets converted to one of those -- that s not the only promotion but the only one relevant here -- and which also means that there is no automatic conversion to whatever type you specify with va_arg

the integer to unsigned conversion routine to_unsigned can produce a warning if the input integer value is greater than can be expressed in the number of bits specified 6 so the result is clamped to 6 bits with the mod operator

it would be ok to use int in your case that is a signed 32-bit integer type but it looks like ushort unsigned 16-bit is more precise here

pedantic note when printing integer types that might wider than int unsigned insure the final computed result matches the specifier

on your system unsigned int is apparently larger than uint16_t int is a greater ranked integer type than short in the standard 6.3.1.1 even if they are of the same size

1 as chux has noted in a comment if unsigned is larger than uint32_t arithmetic on uint32_t goes through the usual integer promotions and if not it stays as uint32_t

an object with an integer type other than int and signed int whose integer rank is less than or equal to the rank of int and unsigned int a bit field of type _bool int signed int or unsigned int

according the books the variations of type integer occupy more or less bytes of memory depending on the architecture however the type unsigned short values â â can get up to 65 535 since the type unsigned long 4 294 967 295

integer promotions turn anything smaller than an int into either an int or an unsigned int and leave everything else as is.

this means in effect that types cannot be demoted to a type with lesser precision by the integer promotions it is possible for uint64_t to be promoted to int or unsigned int but only if the range of the type is at least that of uint64_t

in general floating point types are stronger than integer ones and unsigned are stronger than signed.

here is how gcc does it it sign extends if the integer type is larger than the pointer type this ll happen regardless of the integer being signed or unsigned just because that s how gcc decided to implements it

it can only disappoint you if your compiler has an integer type wider than unsigned long long and you use it


others
but if the inputs had a pair integers where the absolute value of the positive integer was smaller than the absolute value of the negative integer then the output was what you would expect from unsigned 2 s complement

note you will need 2 bytes the represent any port number so pn 16 integer or pn 16 unsigned will be better

in most higher-level languages higher than assembly integer variables have a quality of being signed or unsigned

after analysing your code there is a final unsigned 32 bit integer overflow in the last multiplication by 10 you multiplying by 10 not by 2 so you can get up to four new bits in each multiplication making it easier for an overflow even if you do unsigned arithmetic which is recommended so you don t need to play with the signs


earlier bit operators
when converted to unsigned -1 becomes 2 32 - 1 assuming that strlen returns a 32 bit integer which is greater than the length of the string you are comparing with

the idea here is threefold readability using operator functions with compatible left and right arguments as well as return value and the use of integer multiplying operators being faster than unsigned operators

string.fromcharcode won t work correctly with values greater than 0xffff more than an unsigned 16-bit integer

it s interesting and probably relevant that the value is larger than an unsigned 64 bit integer but since the value is a string this is theoretically legal

in fact your going to get a value bigger than an integer can hold 4 billion unsigned 2 billion signed before the stack is going to over flow fibbonaci 46

the problem is that the input integer is larger than what would fit in an unsigned long long

and by the way are you sure you need a signed integer texture as unsigned would be much more natural for your use case

earlier i was getting unsigned byte integer is greater than maximum but not every single time and not this time

glasspane only added more troubles to me because i could not scroll jscrollpane which is under glasspane and redispatching mouse event suggested in glasspane swing tutorial did not help at all because mouselistener on glasspane did not receive mousedragged


ubuntu	freebsd---------------------------------------------------

others
some aspect of ubuntu are better and some aspects of freebsd are better in terms of performance numbers


expander	itemscontrol---------------------------------------------------

others
basically what is happening is that when i expand one of the expander items and that itemscontrol contains a larger amount of items 25 the rendering of the list appears to be truncated


elf	coff---------------------------------------------------

others
it runs on a number of platforms and supports more than just elf files i believe it also supports coff and a few others


qstring	qbytearray---------------------------------------------------

others
i have to convert the qstring of the file s contents to qbytearray in order to compare them or vice versa and comparing bytes seems like the cleanest method however when converted from qstring to qbytearray the size of the new qbytearray is smaller than what it should be


django	web.py---------------------------------------------------

others
web.py is more low-level comparing with django

i m new to sever-side programming.some people told me that web.py is more suitable for beginners like me than django

web.py has a templating language of it s own it looks easier than django s


flask	eve---------------------------------------------------

others
eve s server_name seems to be based on the configuration variable by the same name from flask see more on server name below the table in the flask configuration docs


super	self---------------------------------------------------

others
as i commented in the code queue.dequeue self can be written more pythonically using the super builtin

unless you have super -calls involved or more generally subclasses that override x and call directly to a.x self as part of their override s implementation looking for the first item in type self .mro that has an x attribute would work --

also as stated by martijn pieters using super super .__str__ is better than doing it the way i did deck.__str__ self

you should call init on super and update self more details here

the second correct class doesn t even seem to inherent since it has no super .__init__ even worse it is setting up a method that is never even called paintevent self event which takes an argument that seemingly comes from nowhere


better useful parent.foo
normally you can just call parent class methods directly by doing parent.foo self ... but in case of multiple inheritance super is much more useful

i think a.__init__ self x is better then super .__init__ x because it supports multiple inheritance and i didn t find a way to do it with super


filewriter	filechannel---------------------------------------------------

others
i saw some java.nio.channels.filechannel s examples but i found filechannel was more complex to read or write string to file compare to filewriter


smartgit	gitkraken---------------------------------------------------

others
i think you should use gitkraken it will be better than smartgit on ubuntu


pyquery	beautifulsoup---------------------------------------------------

others
pyquery uses the css selector syntax familiar from jquery which i find more intuitive than beautifulsoup s

although pyquery is the jquery equivalent judging by your use case i think maybe something like beautifulsoup could be better suited for what you re looking to do


processing results lxml
also pyquery is significantly faster than beautifulsoup in many cases for processing results

pyquery is based on lxml so it s also much faster than beautifulsoup


qabstractitemmodel	qabstracttablemodel---------------------------------------------------

others
well obviously you created an implementation qabstracttablemodel which has a little bit more specialized interface than qabstractitemmodel


cakephp	phalcon---------------------------------------------------

others
phalcon is more powerful verstile but to get started with it i feel you have to be a better php developer than you do to get started with something like cakephp


wordpress	elgg---------------------------------------------------

others
it is working only for simple .php files but wordpress is more complex and after long period of loading it show elgg nothing found site loaded


flask	django---------------------------------------------------

bottle comfortable batteries
either will do the trick but bottle or in my preference flask will be faster as it is much more lightweight than django

i m building an application in both bottle and flask to see which i am more comfortable with as django is too much batteries included

in this approach you won t get much from django you are better of with bottle flask

if you re looking for something less heavy than django perhaps try flask or bottle


others
but a friend told me to begin with flask as it s simpler and will help me when i start learning django as django is more complicated than flask

also as soon as you re comfortable with flask you can easily move to django and have more fun while playing with it thereafter

both frameworks are fairly easy to implement flask is much easier than django imo although django has a built in authentication layer that you can use albeit more difficult to implement in a client server scenario like you need

django is an all-in-one package while pyramid and flask give you more flexibility

i can think of two relatively straightforward things you can do without ditching php though i have to mention that php doesn t have much to recommend it and you would likely be better off with python django python flask or ruby rails

i am trying re-write an application in django which was earlier in written in flask

django is very batteries included meaning that it comes with much more out-of-the-box than say flask and to me a large part of that the user auth system

current task looks like flask is ok for it since it is smaller and simplier than django

our team use django as our frame before but now we use flask as our frame because it is more light than django but we still use django template.

flask is more focused on simplicity instead of functionality while django has more functionality

i read that flask for beginner is better than django because educational reasons at the same time django have django oscar


framework smaller community
if you are looking for a web framework simpler than django look at flask flask uses jinja2 as the default template engine

i would suggest furthering your knowledge of python it s an amazing language so it s gonna be fun and then go back to django or maybe start with a smaller framework like flask which does less magic

flask has a really great albeit smaller than django community and there are a lot of extensions available for common web-app extensions in the extensions directory

if you are looking for the latter then flask is a micro framework that is considerably smaller than django


integration mongodb first
now you can get all those same features with flask if you re prepared to do some integration work but the argument can just as easily be made that django is better for beginners precisely because it does come with all those things built-in

but if the use of mongodb is a must then i suggest that you reconsider using django in the first place because mongodb has a better integration with flask through mongoengine


memcpy	memset---------------------------------------------------

others
memset behaves like strcpy but the difference is that memcpy copied the data as it is byte but strcpy copies the formatted string as well so takes more time than memcpy to execute

i suggest you starting with memset instead though since memcpy is much more complicated than you might think

at the very least i would have expected that before memset b 0 len that memcpy would be slower because the of lazy allocation first touch on the first of the 100 iterations

the problem is that memcpy is only slighly slower than memset when i expect it to be about two times slower since it operations on twice the memory

it is understandable that memset is faster than memcpy

as you have already seen when you eliminate memset datasrc 0 n the first memcpy is even slower because the pages for the source must be allocated as well


tiff	png---------------------------------------------------

bit smaller depth
the resulting png compression may produce a file size larger than your tiff compression

tiff â any bit depth any compression lossy or lossless everything including the kitchen sink â and no better than png

the resulting file from this png approach is smaller in size than a tiff file and i guess may rescale better


others
jpg or png should get you smaller than tiff

today png is much more popular than tiff so if you re writing files outside of your own data store png would be a more common choice and you d need to work through nsimagerep to get there


apache	nginx---------------------------------------------------

need ffmpeg specific
there is no need to use apache or ffmpeg nginx would be alot easier

nginx is quicker though honestly you ll struggle to see the difference except for very high volume sites and has quickly become the web server of choice for a lot of people if you don t have any specific need for apache for your code


others
it seems your apache is more busy than your nginx

apache is like a 4 by 4 contains everything you need nginx is more like a ferrari not much there but it does what you need it to

the syntax for nginx configuration is different but more clean than apache

nginx uses an event based non blocking single thread and the memory usage is relatively much lower than apache

the switchover to nginx really had little to do with the rewrite rule and more to do with getting away from apache 2.2 default upstream version for centos however with nginx rewrite rules are more straight forward than apache s imo

common examples of this software include apache most famous popular - runs like 40 of all websites you browse including facebook.com and nginx becoming more popular

it is slower than nginx because apache with the event mpm is very roughly equivalent to an event-driven http proxy nginx varnish haproxy in front of apache with the worker mpm

i m about to try apache but most write ups suggest that this is worse than nginx at this job

then make nginx reverse proxy to apache cache all static files which offloads that from apache because nginx serves them instead meaning apache can do more php requests and also get nginx to perform output compression

any one of the reverse proxy systems can likely do this nginx is popular too and generally has easier configuration than apache but i ve never used it with https

i m significantly more comfortable with apache but learning to use nginx has been pretty exciting or as exciting as learning to configure a new webserver can be

also nginx uses a lot less memory than apache

i am more familiar with apache php combo rather than say nginx and fastcgi with php setup so focusing on this area

i also know there is nginx and haproxy although i have never used either of them and have a lot more experience with apache

i m new to nginx and want to try it out since it apparently is much faster and less resource-hungry than apache but i can t see why this would be such a hard thing to achieve

apache is more flexable then nginx but it comes with a high price in performance

i would give you more info except a ip aliasing on centos 7 is more involved than i like much easier on solaris and b i m not familiar at all with configuring nginx very easy on apache

apache s design is thread per client while nginx uses the reactor pattern meaning - nginx can handle much more traffic than apache as a web server about 50 times the number of requests

the famous line is nginx is not apache in other words nginx has better ways to handle urls than rewriting

apache is more friendly configuration wise htaccess htpasswd rewrite rules etc nginx is fast in regard to static assets

i ve been attempting to upgrade to php 7.1 using phpbrew and elected to install it with nginx as i read everywhere that it was simpler than apache not that simple in my humble opinion

nginx is very fast much lighter than apache

servers like lighthttp and nginx can handle large amounts of traffic in much less memory than apache if you can sacrifice apache s power and flexibility or if you just don t need those things which often you don t

in fact nginx can use select instead of epoll if you compile it with the --with-select_module option and i bet it will still be more efficient than apache


web faster concurrency
is nginx + php-fpm is suppose to do server operations much faster than apache + mod-php due to efficient usage of memory and other resources

apache mod_wsgi will actually benefit from this as well if everything is setup properly as nginx will isolate apache from slow http clients allowing apache to perform better with fewer resources

although this thread is more than a year old it still merits from the fact that no one mentioned about the not so recent innovations of nginx lighty and other web servers which scale much better than apache at higher concurrency and consume lesser resources

note that in any case for increased security and fast static file css js delivery you might want to add a reverse proxy layer nginx usually provides better performance but apache works as well before the nodejs python server

it may even use a different server software say nginx or lighttpd that has less overhead than the traditional apache setup

i have configured tomcat with apache web server in past and never slowness problem before and practically speaking nginx is said to much lighter and faster than apache web server

nginx is faster and lighter but many people find it easier to work with apache because of .htaccess support nginx does not have an analog due to performance concern

i m currently using apache as web server but i have heard that nginx can handle more requests with more concurrency than that of apache because of the non-blocking nature of the system

hi everyone i need help with this i ve already set up nginx + php and it works great faster than apache my problem is how to setup a multiple projects in one ip

if you have long-running requests i think the performance will be pretty bad because apache use one thread per connection nginx performs much better

i have no idea what i m doing so i dove nose-first into nginx -- which i had never used before -- because someone told me it s better than apache at dealing with lots of small tasks and requests -- not that i would know how to turn apache into a proxy mind you

tornadoweb and nginx are popular web servers for the moment and many benchmarkings show that they have a better performance than apache under certain circumstances

if this is what you re really trying to do rather than a simplified example you may be able to accomplish the same thing with apache mod_rewrite or the equivalent in nginx and have better performance since you re not executing any php code at that point

as for apache vs nginx in regards to your django app it seems that mod_python is indeed faster than nginx lighty + fastcgi but that s no surprise because cgi regardless of any speed ups is still slow

i ve heard it suggested that i use nginx as a reverse proxy in front of apache and node.js is that a better solution than just nginx

apache mod_php is much more stable and cleaner while nginx will often deliver http bad gateway error coded in 502


better long polling
but doing that kind of things with apache is rather painfull and is easier with nginx

16 cores apache would scale better than nginx while nginx would process more client requests

i am not going into how to do rewrites on nginx because it is much more complicated than apache

nginx is more performant than apache in most cases with high-levels of requests

would be for running many php scripts all the same in the background - nginx be the better solution or apache

the remote server is set up to allow very few maximum concurrent clients generally nginx handles many concurrent clients better than apache since it doesn t need to fork a new process for every request so if it becomes an issue you might want to look into switching web servers

nginx + gunicorn is likely to work better than apache + modwsgi at this point in time

you don t want to use apache because nginx is better suited since nginx is built for async i o

next you ll find that the threading model of nginx is much more efficient than apache s for what you re doing

having nginx in front of apache is a better set up in my opinion

as other already suggested nginx + gunicorn or better nginx + uwsgi are better options than apache + mod_python to serve your django app

nginx is better at handling requests since it does not spawn a new process for every request unlike apache

also you can run php behind nginx using php-fpm but that s quite a challenge to get working and for that reason apache may be a better choice

nginx or other server is not much more efficient than apache

i think you would like lemp e stands for the nginx and for a lot small projects it would be better than apache

just one tip if only job for the http server will be just proxying the play apps consider using some lighter option than apache for an example nginx or lighttpd you ll find sample configurations for all of them in play s documentation

further than that i wouldn t use apache at all if i needed to optimize things nginx is much better as a server it s even faster than node.js for serving static files for example

also nginx s configuration is much more flexible than apache and by having it on the front end it gives you a lot of flexibility

if you want to use something in front of it though i suggest you use something like nginx better than apache since nginx is also asynchronous like node and it s performs really well at serving static files

why nginx might be better than apache when one is long polling and why long polling is better than periodically polling a server

nginx with its own mod_wsgi seems to perform even better than apache but hey you didn t ask about that

also when your setting up the server i would say start with nginx it s uses less resources than apache

uwsgi is better if you are using nginx i find nginx far better than apache personally

as such i m assuming that about 96 of our users will being using apache and not lighttpd or nginx which are supposedly more suited for long polling

i will say that nginx tends to handle heavier loads better than apache though so take a look at that

i aways heart that nginx performs better than apache server

nginx can be configured to only respond to requests matching a predefined pattern far easier than with apache

now back to the question my guess based on reading tests published here would be that the proper multi-thread apache architecture should scale better than nginx on multi-core cpus

i dont recomend apache to do these nginx fits better with nodejs

nginx is better suited than apache as it is light and single threaded vs apache thread per request in most normal setups

nginx also happens to be better than apache at writing logfiles interestingly

apache made a claim that apache 2.4 will offer performance as good or better than nginx

i don t know from your question if it s a requirement to keep using apache but if possible i think nginx would work much better for you here

i recommend you to use nginx as an reverse proxy since the configuration is easier and the performance is much better than apache

using nginx rather than apache to server the images nginx generally works better to server static content such as this

using a different server such as one apache and one nginx or one apache and one lighttpd will be much easier because their configuration files don t conflict with each other

letâ s encrypt provides great scripts for apache 2 and nginx but not lighttpd which is much more comfortable for small systems like raspberry pi or old boxes

also you should consider using nginx as server that s more flexible than apache

i have used this pattern with apache before and nginx seems more capable in most respects so i m sure this must be possible

4 i d like to understand why nginx might be better than apache when one is long polling and why long polling is better than periodically polling a server

id love to know how to solve this since using nginx sometimes is a better option than apache and having this issue with fuelphp framework and not being able to use this two great tools together is awful


connections memory mode
however i m on a memory limited vps and i d rather not run one set of php-cgi processes for nginx with their own apc cache and another for apache using more memory for their apc cache

nginx or lighttpd in fastcgi mode use less ram than apache and they can handle more concurrent connections

also have a look at nginx for example it is fast and uses less memory than apache to handle client connections


faster static file
you can serve it from for example nginx varnish which are usually faster than apache

also what makes nginx better than apache in this case

for static file serving i found nginx performance lot faster than apache

nginx is faster than apache handles slow clients better and is generally easier to use

for me apache is easier to use but i prefer nginx as it is much faster

there seems to be a consensus that nginx serves static content faster than apache

nginx is more picky about case of file names than apache

i will add that i ve often heard that nginx is faster than apache for serving static files to the point that it s sometimes worth using nginx for static files and reverse proxying to apache for dynamic content

how can nginx performs better than apache

nginx is actually quite a lot easier than apache in my opinion

nginx is faster than apache and the configuration is easier

serving static files with nginx is much more efficient than with apache

nginx is still faster and i might choose it but apache isn t asleep

paradoxally it does not mean that apache is faster than nginx it just means that on 1 2 3 .

nginx works great by itself and will likely be much faster than apache

not only is nginx supposedly faster than apache at delivering static content but this also offloads your rails application for every image stylesheet javascript or whatever other static content

for example nginx is considered faster than apache and a nodejs application is considered faster than a php application

nginx makes apache better

i switched from apache to nginx to save memory especially to serve static file i seem to be using about 75 less memory with nginx

i want to move to nginx since it s better than apache

very fast static assets nginx is faster than apache at serving static assets css js images ... and uses very little memory to do so

apache is more popular and has more features nginx is smaller and faster and has less features

nginx uses less memory than apache given the size of your setup i would definitely recommend that

i read that nginx is faster than apache and i want to try it with some of the projects and leave the others with apache

when i was googling info on nginx it appears to be faster than apache and works well in serving static pages

for example nginx is much faster than apache

i know nginx has lower memory footprint and little faster than apache in serving static files

nginx is typically faster than apache but with a low request server it hardly matters

nginx â without any optimizations done â is much faster than apache

however since i m used to apache it was faster for me to configure the site to run on apache and switch to nginx when performance problems occured

i am not an expert in deployment but in my experience nginx is much faster and more friendly to django compared to apache

nginx will definitely work faster than apache

nginx s static file performance is better than apache

if you aren t using any of the other features of apache consider using something lighter and faster like lighttpd or nginx

i ve read that nginx is faster for static pages but there are questions about its performance with php compared to apache s performance with php

however my experience is that configuring it in apache is significantly more complex than configuring it in nginx and even with worker it still is not quite as efficient with nginx

it seems to be common wisdom that if you are deploying django on an apache server then you should still put an nginx server in front of the application to serve static files at which nginx is more performant

and finally from my experience nginx is faster than apache

we have a few clients who have very high traffic sites running apache slower than nginx with varnish in front of it and they get way more traffic than you are saying with little to no performance problems

it s just a little slower than using apache bench directly against nginx

i have recently read that nginx is faster than apache

one of the main advantages people discuss when choosing nginx over apache is higher performance in serving large numbers of static file so when using laravel are those static files loaded as dynamic php files


istream	atof---------------------------------------------------

others
atof is indeed better in reading floating point values than istream


strtol	strtok---------------------------------------------------

others
for instance strtol is better than atoi and you should be checking each time whether strtok returns null


turbogears	pyramid---------------------------------------------------

others
the difference between pylons and pyramid are the merge of repoze.bfg and turbogears which brings more api resources


sctp	tcp---------------------------------------------------

others
as i understand websockets are on top of tcp and have higher latency than sctp that underlies webrtc when for example sending binary data between server and browser that also could be 2 peers in webrtc


different better
how sctp is better then tcp

sctp is not better than tcp in any way but it does something different


wildfly	jboss---------------------------------------------------

others
jboss eap which is based on wildfly deliberately has a slower release schedule

jboss 6.4 had no problems with that but yes wildfly is more strict looks like

2 integration would be easier with jboss eap support from eap 5 or wildfly however if you don t need any java ee technologies i would go with more lightweight server like tomcat or jetty

is it because request response handling on wildfly is kind of more lightweight than the jboss 4.2.3


biicode	conan---------------------------------------------------

others
conan uses a more direct and easier approach to library dependencies management than biicode supporting both binary packages as building from source


d3.js	plotly---------------------------------------------------

others
i can use d3.js but using plotly would be better


bluestacks	android-emulator---------------------------------------------------

others
in xda-forums i read about memu - most powerful android-emulator for pc better than bluestacks

2 if your host machine laptop doesn t have more ram then you might want to find alternative android-emulator like genymotion bluestacks which takes less memory than android-emulator

yes some functionality possible only on device but you can try also bluestacks app player which has more possibilities than android-emulator

this android-emulator works better than bluestacks

use genymotion or bluestacks for emulator.these third party android-emulator is better performance as compare to builtin android studio android-emulator


theano	cudnn---------------------------------------------------

others
finally i don t expect to learn many meaningful lessons from this benchmark both cntk and theano are calling the same cudnn implementation the advantages of cntk are more around higher level things such as a comes with a high-level library b the user doesn t have to worry about the batch and sequence axes except for a few specialized operations c efficient recurrent networks d efficient i o e easy distributed training

usr local lib python2.7 dist-packages theano sandbox cuda init .py 600 userwarning your cudnn version is more recent than the one theano officially supports

userwarning your cudnn version is more recent than the one theano


direct3d	directx---------------------------------------------------

others
directx has a wider scope than opengl in that directx is composed of directsound directplay and direct3d etc


virus	botnet---------------------------------------------------

others
obviously very similar to the virus answer above the difference being that while viruses usually replicate spread do a preprogrammed inconvenient thing a botnet is more of a take control of your machine for a future usually nefarious but dynamic purpose. i think the hosts your agent can more easily change with a botnet too


jtextfield	jtable---------------------------------------------------

others
that is pointless if you are expecting more than one output from your resultset you need something more than a jtextfield maybe a jtable


uibezierpath	uiimage---------------------------------------------------

others
the uibezierpath class seems easier to use so how could i get that drawing in a uiimage


boost	eigen---------------------------------------------------

others
inspecting the assembly shows that in the sequential access case eigen is faster because the sum becomes vectorized while it does not when using raw boost multi_array


qlabel	qtextbrowser---------------------------------------------------

others
i m trying to force the qlabel qpushbutton and qtableview marked by trailing underscores in their names be two times higher than qtextbrowser having below


nsurlconnection	nsoperation---------------------------------------------------

others
right now all the photos are downloaded with a custom nsoperation class run on an nsoperationqueue .however i have heard about nsurlconnection async being more efficient and was wondering which is better of this situation


gridbaglayout	springlayout---------------------------------------------------

others
not many layout problems can t be conquered using it and its easy to understand as opposed to springlayout groupedlayout etc and far less code and more robust than gridbaglayout


strcpy	memmove---------------------------------------------------

others
marcus yes memmove is faster than strcpy and faster than python but why


didreceivememorywarning	dealloc---------------------------------------------------

others
remove dealloc reference in didreceivememorywarning will be better


hazelcast	ignite---------------------------------------------------

others
probably the most important point is that apache ignite indexing is a lot more sophisticated than hazelcast

ignite is much more ram-hungry than hazelcast


alarmmanager	wakelock---------------------------------------------------

others
this is better than alarmmanager pending intent - no wakelock draining of battery etc.

it also uses a wakelock while in my case i think an alarmmanager could be a better idea


packets	multicast---------------------------------------------------

others
as for streaming it s better to use udp first because it lowers the load on servers but mostly because you can send packets with multicast it s simpler than sending it to each connected client

multicast are more efficient than datagram socket however it also uses udp and hence does not provide any guarantee that the data packets will be received by all receivers

a third possibility would be to send out some form of discovery packets either by broadcast or better by multicast udp


snap.svg	raphael---------------------------------------------------

others
this should be possible maybe be aware snap.svg isn t so compatible with older browsers in which case you could look at raphael which is snaps older brother d3.js is very well established as well


fossil	git---------------------------------------------------

others
4 fewer merge options than in git though the fossil workflow makes merging less likely to occur in the first place.

from the article it sounds like fossil isn t a database any more than git is a database

as the comments already mention if you are starting out with version control you would be well advised to choose a newer system than rcs git mercurial fossil subversion ...

fossil is another one that s easy to use i would say easier than git to learn but it uses an sqlite file to store your code and i m not sure if it scales to really big projects


glfw	sdl---------------------------------------------------

others
however due to it lack of android portability i have to replace all of my glfw code with sdl since sdl is more portable


uilabel	uitextview---------------------------------------------------

others
using a category on nsattributedstring in priority before uilabel could be more interesting in case you wanted to use the custom nsattributedstring for others kind of object like a uitextview

you would have to use a uitextfield or a uitextview - uitextview being more like a uilabel than a uitextfield

my problem is uitextview is more complicated than uilabel

or even easier rather than adding uilabel objects to a uiscrollview you could just use a uitextview

i think the problem happened because the padding left right of uitextview is bigger than uilabel

i m aware that uitextview is much more suitable for this as it implements uitextinput protocol which has all the methods i need but due to a bug in ios i m limited to uilabel

also consider using uilabel instead of uitextview if you don t need to edit information inside since uitextview take longer to allocate and init and are generally slower than uilabel


cause requirement results
try to use uitextview rather than uilabel could be better cause uitextview use a contentview that maybe won t be resized immediatly

instead of using uilabel using uitextview gets better results

i too had a similar requirement initially i used uilabel and then i realized that uitextview is better


directx	gdi---------------------------------------------------

others
if you are talking about someone else s there is no promise that they will render larger than the screen since would be wise to clip their painting to what is visible and they may be further constrained by other factors such as the size of a directx surface which is smaller than the gdi limit

using getfrontbufferdata in directx method is slower than gdi itself


frontbuffer acceleration simplification
directx is in general much faster than gdi due to the fact that it has full acceleration on most video cards

speed is usually faster than gdi and slower than directx and depends greatly on how you do things seen something to work 60 times faster after rewriting in a sensible way

directx is way faster than gdi

i need to capture screen as fast as it is possible i used to use gdi but it s too slow then i read that using directx will be faster but the time of capturing screen and converting surface to bitmap is approximately same

directx should be faster than gdi except when you are reading from the frontbuffer which is very slow

to say directx is faster than gdi is also something of a simplification - wpf and gdi-based rendering technologies just have different performance characteristics


migrate	upgrade---------------------------------------------------

others
however if you are looking to migrate to vsts things are much more complicated and you will need to upgrade to tfs 2017 rtm at a minimum

if you overwrite the env versioning the rake db migrate will go downgrade rather than upgrade if versioning is smaller than last known versioning in db schema so please check and avoid similar environment variable

i did it an upgrade test on a dummy machine and when i get to the real thing i had to uninstall and remove all leftover db s tfs_configuration you can see migrate data from tfs 2008 to an already working tfs 2012


robospice	android-async-http---------------------------------------------------

others
while i like the api of android-async-http better it seems like robospice was more recently developed and supports better libraries


gridview	repeater---------------------------------------------------

understanding big difference
the repeater is still faster than the gridview but the difference shouldn t be big if you code it right

in my understanding repeater is most suitable since it faster than gridview


others
maybe a repeater is better but you will be fine with a gridview if you are familiar with it

instead of using a gridview i d use a repeater which has less overhead and lets you write more compact html for a smaller payload to the client bind the master idatareader to that repeater

each button raises the correct event but the events never reach the gridview because they are handled at a lower level by the repeater

in simple words we can say performance of repeater is far better than gridview

i think the performance depends a lot on the data provider paging and sorting and filtering the data are easily the most expensive tasks when dealing with databases - so picking a renderer gridview listview repeater is more dependent on your comfort with that particular control

a repeater might be a better decision than a gridview as they are friendlier for using custom layouts

repeater has fewer templates then gridview

the bind method really isn t for the repeater it s more for the formview or gridview where you are editing just one item in the list not every item in the list

edit using a gridview might be easier then a table since you only need to bind in the itemdatabound the dataset to the gridview in the repeater


control better output
not necessarily better than the repeater suggestion but another option is to use a gridview control and a datatable data structure

using repeater contorl over gridview will give you more control over formating your output

the repeater will allow more control over what is rendered instead of rendering a tabular output as in the case of gridview

alternatively use a gridview though i find that repeater gives you more control over the emitted markup


allegro	sdl---------------------------------------------------

others
i d strongly recommend to go with allegro 5.1.x it s a little bit more difficult than sfml but very functional and easier than sdl it s got nice support and it s compatible with plenty of os


tcplistener	tcpclient---------------------------------------------------

others
on the server side you re using tcplistener which is nothing more than a socket or tcpclient factory

what i suggest that you use sockets for you needs you can use the framework socket class but tcplistener class and tcpclient class are much more easy to use


pylons	web2py---------------------------------------------------

others
anyway the most important issue is that web2py is easier than django pylons php and rails


ffmpeg	libav---------------------------------------------------

others
not to be confused ffmpeg is more recent and libav was used in some distributions of linux

ubuntu 12.04 ships with the ffmpeg fork libav in version 0.8 which is more compatible with ffmpeg 1.0+ or even later ffmpeg versions iirc


stringbuilder	stringtokenizer---------------------------------------------------

others
stringtokenizer is faster than stringbuilder


theano	keras---------------------------------------------------

others
it is similar in spirit to keras which is built as a high-level api on top of theano tensorflow cntk although the main difference is that lasagne implements only one backend allowing it to integrate more deeply with theano features

and using keras or lasagne is way simpler to develop nns then pure theano which was just side research project in montreal to support development of pylearn


nyromodal	blockui---------------------------------------------------

others
after some research and lot of quick prototyping i feel like my old companion nyromodal is the only option left for me which gives me flexibility of controlling it using its extensive api i went through other options given by the users and topup and blockui came closer rest of them are also good but doesn t meet my needs


macports	homebrew---------------------------------------------------

others
i m using homebrew as it s newer than macports and i don t know enough to choose between them

homebrew is generally a bit nicer than macports as it doesn t require lots of sudo action

currently macports has many more packages 18.6 k than there are homebrew formulae 3.1k owing to its maturity

con you can encounter issues related to library versions and dependencies macports has more software than homebrew

it may be that macports doesn t help i have been luckier with homebrew than macports when installing cgal

overriding choice for me is macports as it has many more packages than homebrew and it puts its stuff in opt local to stay out of the way of other programs

homebrew has less of a stranglehold on your machine doesn t require as much reading as macports


easymock	powermockito---------------------------------------------------

others
powermockito is an extension of other mocking frameworks like mockito or easymock that comes with more powerful capabilities


mod-alias	mod-rewrite---------------------------------------------------

others
evidently though mod-alias can be somewhat faster than mod-rewrite all other things being equal of course


nhibernate	massive---------------------------------------------------

others
i have noticed that ef is slower than linq2sql massive petapoco ado.net and possibly nhibernate


junit	cactus---------------------------------------------------

others
junit is older and have more extensions dbunit cactus etc


opencv	emgucv---------------------------------------------------

others
the results end up very close but the emgucv image comes out a little bit blurrier than the opencv image

unless you re doing very heavy processing working with a single frame is probably faster than transferring it to the server as far as i know emgucv in c# isn t considerably slower than opencv in c c++


min	rank---------------------------------------------------

others
a simple way to get the indices of a rank 1 array arr for elements greater than value min is

thus if the rank of an nxm matrix is less than min n m then the matrix is singular

i tried this but sometimes user by min score got higher rank


httpclient	okhttp---------------------------------------------------

others

slower httpurlconnection method
httpclient is depreciated while okhttp is comparatively faster than httpurlconnection which is generally used by retrofit2

but the post method okhttp is more slower than httpclient s post always more slower than okhttp s get method


bots	chatterbot---------------------------------------------------

others
i initially was using chatterbot s default storage adapter and after training with all data the bots took more than a minute to respond to simple message like hello


readonly	temporary---------------------------------------------------

others
is it good idea to make serializer private static readonly to avoid spawning hundreds of temporary objects is it more faster than i did


redmine	mantis---------------------------------------------------

others
i have been trying out redmine to see if i like it better than mantis

i ve read that mantis contains less project management tools than redmine

i think you ll find that your team will like either trac or redmine more than bugzilla or mantis


uitabbaritem	uitabbarcontroller---------------------------------------------------

others
i have a uitabbarcontroller with more than 5 uitabbaritem so the morenavigationcontroller is available

after googling i found that we can t add images on more tab in uitabbarcontroller because more tab is automatically displayed by uitabbarcontroller when uitabbaritem is more then 5


rtos	qnx---------------------------------------------------

others
an rtos such as os 9 or qnx would be more suited as these can operate more like a gpos in the sense of loading and executing independently linked executables


stopwatch	dispatchertimer---------------------------------------------------

others
i am trying to move away from dispatchertimer to stopwatch to get a more constant speed of the game as dispatchertimer skips turns if there are too many objects in the game


gulp-sass	node-sass---------------------------------------------------

others
the cons of gulp-sass is that you get more than just node-sass - you also get gulp-utils and other things - which is a problem if you are not using gulp in the first place


hide	show---------------------------------------------------

button greater images
show less will be hide and load more button will be show .thanks

now what i have to do is to hide discover more button when there are no more images to show

so if it s greater than 0 show the button otherwise hide it


element effect tokens
then you can use the itemcheckedchanged event which will get triggered when an item is checked and here you can see how many items are currently checked and if more than one show the element with the text and hide the tokens

simply call .slideup to hide element and .sidedown to show element read more on the jquery effect


others
i modified the _searchnode function so it will hide matching nodes greater than the level delimiter but will show parent node even non-matching as long as the term matches within its children

problem is that although both datagridview filling and updating a progressbar goes from same loop in steps by 100 filling of datagridview ends much faster than progressbar show a progress and hide it on about 50

can anyone help me to hide it onload and show when is more than delta and hide on scroll up when is before delta

on resize check if screens aspect ratio is greater than 1.0 width height if so display your page if not hide you page and show a message asking the user to rotate their device

it doesn t show at all if hide is called less than 0.5s after show and it show for at least 0.5s this prevents very fast flickering stuff that you might see with naive implementations

then let us create a script that when see more is clicked it will hide this see more and would show the content inside

you need to hide the elements you don t want to show and be more specific in your conditions

so in order to have certain .annual rows show instead of hide make a more specific css class to actually show it

ironically enough its object model show more details than it hide - good for learning but bad for abstraction

i want to implement a functionality on gmap api that if the zoom is more than 17 show all the markers otherwise just hide them

ie contentloadingprogressbar wouldn t show up if hide is called in less than 0.5s after executing show thus preventing from quick flickering in the ui

it s just a supposition but try recreating the form widget onsuccess or even hide the form onsubmit actually onclick is better and show another form to the user

i ve changed your links to have the same class show could be named better the popup button i ve given a class of closepopup and your popups have a class of popup clicking either close one will hide all popups that are show this might not be the desired behavior

i am implementing a comment system in my website and i need to hide the text after exceeding 5 lines in a view width of 300px and show read more i ve tried doing so with string length but every character has a different width for example 500 characters of at sign in a view width of 300px will have more lines than 500 characters of

i have searched for a solution but most expand collapse scripts completley hide the layer whilst others show an expand show more link but do not toggle to show a collapse show less link

any suggestions on how to manage the android actionbar in phonegap - i ve seen some other similar questions but generally asking how to show it seems like getting it to hide is less popular

would it make more sense to style both header and display the main header by default and then use javascript to hide the main header and show the hidden smaller header when the user scrolls

when user selects a file i need to show the button add more file .otherwise hide the button.on loading of page i make button with class #add_more hidden through jquery.initially when first file is uploaded add more button get displayed.this works fine.from second case onwards i need to show add more only when the next file is uploaded.pls help me

set show read more to hide

to hide action bar invoke hide method using getsupportactionbar getactionbar in case of minsdkversion is 11 or higher as show below

the id specific hotspots show an area #id-ed textarea at mouseover and then hide the textareas at mouseout note the css display hidden was remarkably faster than hide

it displays things normally on the screen of course but when you go to print preview in ie7 the only thing that show is longer description. so in other words it hide that first column and it also hide the second column

when scrolltop is less than 300 show the div otherwise hide it

i suppose it is because you hide them faster than you show them so for a slight second the overal page height is shorter than it should

in the open function make a logical check whether thank you message container is visible assuming that it s visible only if the user has availed the offer and if it s visible hide close remind me later in your case or else show it

not show from start is better than show and then hide

the issue is that if i scroll to the right and click on say column index 20 really any index that hide indices on the left it will freeze all columns below that index which causes the table to snap back to index 0 and not allowing me to scroll because more columns than show are frozen

so what i want is if the list is less than 99 hide something else if the list is more than 100 then show something this is what i placed under ajax success handler

i m using the function window .resize to detect if the total width of all open windows plus some margin is greater than the window s width then hide the first chat window or show the last one if there s space for more windows


none sets better
as a note and for a shorter code using the css display none and jquery show milliseconds and hide milliseconds is quicker you can even animate it by using time like this

also as mentioned elsewhere show is a better option to css visibility as hide sets display none and not visibility


umbraco	dotnetnuke---------------------------------------------------

others
i also had good result with umbraco cms it s a bit more lean than dotnetnuke but not as user friendly and definitely not as popular

while dotnetnuke is a much bigger market it seems to be crowded with a lot of competition versus umbraco which is smaller but it looks like it lacks modules in certain categories

consider umbraco its architecture is definitely better than dotnetnuke s


ninject	spring.net---------------------------------------------------

others
mef linfu and spring.net are faster than ninject but still pretty

note i do not know much about ninject but i worked with spring.net that is much more complicated


slideup	slidedown---------------------------------------------------

others
jquery slidedown is invoked revealing more input fields in the previously hidden div and then slideup is invoked when mousing out

this will slidedown the navbar when the scroll is greater than 150px and will slideup when is less or equal than 150px

if you want your slidedown to be faster 200 than your slideup 600 you could lookup the current display property


keydown	keyup---------------------------------------------------

field keyup sense
as you can see the keyup events of numpad5 and numpad6 occured earlier than their keydown event

use .val and .keyup using keydown doesn t register the newest value it registers the value before so keyup is better to use for this

also note that using keyup or input makes far more sense than keydown otherwise the previous value will only be evaluated on the next event occurrence

then the right events to do it is keyup more than keydown since the value isn t yet in the field at this moment or on change


others
better use keyup event name as in my example because keydown requires one more click for the last symbol to be updated

i changed to use the keydown event on the listbox insted of keyup and do no longer have the problem as keydown is in dialogbox and not on listview but keyup occurs on listview

also even without using the shift key when typing quickly i often find i haven t quite released a key before typing the next letter so i get more than one keydown event in a row before the corresponding keyup events - this has no noticeable bad effect in normal circumstances but is noticeable when there s code responding to both the down and up events

in my test keyup gives a smoother transition as compared to keydown

the events seem to not follow strict sequential rules second keydown comes earlier than first keyup so the timer gets initialized multiple times

keyup is usually a good time to respond to any action that is going to have an effect on a document but keydown would be better if it s a game where the user wants immediate effect

logic to handle enter + mouse click is placed on keydown and mousedown it could be moved to keyup and mouseup if makes more sense


multiple example little
edit keydown is a little better than keyup for the element bind now enter key fails silently-ish

they have their differences better stick to one i prefer for this example to use keydown just plays better with me you can use keyup

also note that keydown is better for this methodology as keyup will fire multiple times though i guess this will too.

keyup is more preferable than keydown because keydown may occur multiple times if user keeps it pressed

also if you notice i ve changed the keyup event to keydown which is better in my opinion cause when the user holds their finger down on a button the code wouldn t be fired if it is on the keyup event


leaflet	rmaps---------------------------------------------------

others
possibly part of the reason of my problems is that the original code from ramnath uses rmaps while i m using rcharts also developed by ramnath as it is more developed better integrated with shiny and of course includes leaflet


udp	tcp---------------------------------------------------

analogous call letter
tcp is very much analogous to a phone call whereas udp is more like mailboxes

if making a tcp connection is analogous to making telephone call then sending a udp packet is more like mailing a letter


overhead strict developer
generally speaking udp has less overhead than tcp allowing you to receive more data but this is not a strict rule and is almost negligible in this context

moreover tcp has more processing overhead than udp

udp has a much lower overhead than tcp

while udp has less network overhead than tcp it generally relies on you the developer to come up with your own mechanisms for flow control fragmentation handling lost packets etc.

udp just has a smaller overhead than tcp but that comes at the cost of reliability

if they are connected over the internet you could try to use the examples for tcp but tcp has more overhead than udp

udp communication requires much less overhead than tcp due to the number of messages exchanged


connection-oriented need contrivance
whereas for udp sockets you won t need listen accept and connect methods as tcp sockets are connection-oriented sockets while udp sockets are connection less sockets

a heartbeat is by nature a connectionless contrivance so it goes that udp connectionless is more relevant here than tcp connection-oriented


higher throughput performance
you can possibly achieve slightly really marginally higher throughput with udp but then you have the hassle of recreating all the goodies tcp gives you for free

tcp performance was always lower than the best udp and its performance varied wildly by over 600 depending upon the os

if you were attempting to beat the performance of tcp by shifting to udp keep in mind that part of the reason you get lower performance with tcp is because tcp tracks and redelivers the lost packets for you

as an additional note my suspicion is that you d need to indulge yourself in some pretty sophisticated benchmarks before you could conclude that udp is actually going to have higher performance than tcp for web services

so usually the throughput measured by udp should be higher than that from tcp although the difference should be small 5 -10

what is that key feature in tcp that makes it have much much higher throughput than udp

i am confused why tcp throughput is bigger than udp


smaller bits-per-second whole
i don t think so because tcp basically simulates a stream by breaking up your data into smaller packets and sending it while in udp you have more control over the whole process

like matzi suggested udp gives you lower latency and lower packet overhead as the header is smaller than tcp but on the downside the delivery of the packet to the destination is never guaranteed ie

so if the average udp packets were smaller than the average tcp packets then the cpu will be maxed out at a smaller number of bits-per-second with udp than with tcp


control overhead extra
theoretically udp should be be 30-50 faster than tcp because it s missing the extra trip for the ack and has a smaller header overhead however in reality there are many cases where tcp would outperform udp just because of congestion control

the first possible issue i can think of is that because udp doesn t have the overhead inherent in the transmission control that tcp does udp has higher data bandwidth and lower latency


header connection size
this actually happens more commonly with tcp connections but i see no reason udp can t have this problem as well

udp is more of a fire and forget whereas tcp maintains a connection state

getting much more information is needed in the packet header for connection less like udp but why the header size of udp is less than tcp

udp is connection less but at the same level as tcp

you will notice that the tcp header has more fields than the udp header and many of those fields will be populated by information from the handshake

why the header size of udp is less than tcp

udp communication is connection less as compared to tcp which need a connection


bigger iot guaranteed
but there are some cases especially in iot domain udp is more popular than tcp for its bigger transport overheads

tcp sockets- guaranteed delivery bigger payload than udp cumbersome to setup for web based solutions


rtp streaming multimedia
http streaming servers will in most cases use tcp as their network transport rtsp servers usually offer rtp over udp which is more suited to multimedia streaming where some errors packet loss can be tolerated with the benefit of lower latency and less network overheads

tcp streaming for audio can be less helpful than udp rtp as you d have to turn off nagling


better specific file
scenario where udp is better than tcp

i know tcp is better to send file but i have a homework about sending file via udp protocol

the key question was related to what kind of situations would udp be the better choice over tcp

if you can t afford lost packets then tcp is probably a better option than udp since it provides that guarantee out of the box

in general the tcp protocol manages the available network bandwidth better than the udp protocol

we know tcp is better suited for this but the hardware development decided it s got to be udp

tcp is way better then udp for that

my aim is to send live data through udp would be a better option for this but thought it could also be done with tcp with a good connection

-- does udp always perform better than tcp

i have a file that i need to transmit through udp reliably i know tcp is the better option

note i am using udp for this just because i want to learn it and i know tcp can be better for things like a chat

short answer if you can tolerance with any packet loss udp is better otherwise tcp

udp is more popular in nat punching because provides much better results than tcp

this was surprising for me as i expected udp to perform better than tcp

for a game which require quick continous updates udp might be better but i have always gone with tcp

udp will almost always provide better performance than tcp at the cost of reliability

tcp is much better than udp in terms of reliability

or is there any specific scenario where udp is better than tcp

tcp is far better at transferring large quantities of data but when the network fails it s more likely that udp will get through

for this particular application sending simple data chunk to the client from an index given by the client tcp will not perform any better than udp

i think udp will perform better than tcp gcdasyncsocket in your case video transfer

-- in which scenario configuration would i get udp to perform better than tcp

instead of implementing all these over udp it is much better just to switch to tcp

udp is actually expected to work better than tcp in lossy networks or congested networks

to be honest i prefer to use tcp but if udp works better then i have to use udp

i have a working script to stream over tcp but i understand that udp is the better option for video streaming however i m not really sure how to do it

if you care a lot about efficiency or really need tens of thousands of connections then implementing your specific protocol in udp will always be better than tcp

of course tcp would be the better choice but if you only have udp option i d wrap the data into a structure with sequence and buf_length field

i did some research and found that udp may be more suitable in this case because udp hole punching works much better than tcp hole punching

since loosing some packets doesn t matter but speed latency is crucial udp is much better than tcp

i know that tcp would work better for this but i have to use udp

for some requirements tcp is better for some udp

this was surprising for me as it is well known fact that udp performs better than tcp

does udp always perform better than tcp

udp scales better than tcp because of reduced states that need to be maintained in the operating system

now imagine writing lots of small packets across a network udp may cause congestion whereas tcp is better controlled

these are situations where udp is good but in most other situations tcp is better


short suits individual
i am currently writing a server for a fast paced multiplayer game which should be run in udp i read tcp was inappropriate due to the way it handles packet drops in applications requiring timely delivered data please correct me if tcp is more useful the game is not mass multiplayer and should be hosted primarily by the players themselves probably on local dedicated servers

tcp will wait for more data for a short period of time and send it together in a single packet where udp will send each individual datagram

udp suits well for passing short messages but for transferring large amounts of data tcp is more preferable


others
if you re more interested in latency and small amounts of data then something udp based could be better than tcp but you d need to build extra logic for ordering the messages and retrying the lost ones

the main difference is that tcp packets include extra protocol information whereas udp are simpler packets with just a destination the data itself and a checksum

i find using tcp to be very reliable and it can also be very fast if the traffic is stream like meaning mostly unidirectional additionally building a message framer on top of tcp is much easier than building tcp on top of udp

first of udp s datagram is simpler than tcp s one

so assess the situation the development cost of a udp transport is higher to significantly higher than tcp and to some degree you are re-inventing tcp

fast way - tsunami udp it seems that udp protocols are much faster compared to tcp protocals like scp ftp etc

i m aware of the differences in general the facts like tcp is more accurate while udp is more fast

hello to all i am developing an application that needs to send a image via the udp socket.i know that tcp is a better protocol but playing with kryonet in java i have learnt that udp is better for this type of application.i have this small class that i have made

actually we could say that tcp is a higher level protocol compared to udp because tcp includes some advanced features which might be useful .

certainly tcp has more overhead than udp

i am making a network chat server and client in java that runs over udp using datagramsockets even though stream over tcp would make much more sense

udp sockets have much lower overhead than tcp because packets are not acknowledged by the recipient

normally a server wouldn t need to know the client s address beforehand but udp s knottier than tcp the more usual stream-oriented approach to socket communication in many ways

udp lends itself to real-time less latency than tcp

you could get them to do a udp multicast within a lan environment to identify the programs using protocol messages then have a stored cache of each other s identity and then use tcp to connect and do main exchanging of messages which is more reliable than udp

btw i concur that udp is far more appropriate than tcp in this case

to answer the meat of your question why udp in kademlia i don t think that the spec actually explains why to udp or not to use tcp therefor i don t think there is an authoritative answer but my guess is that the authors are were of the opinion that building onto udp would add more flexibility than attempting to stretch tcp into a direction that it specifically wasn t designed for

if the network between the two point have a very high quality udp is absolutely faster than tcp but in some other case such as the gprs network tcp may been faster and more reliability than udp

if your client connections are more or less permanent and not too many clients are connected at the same time tcp is only slightly worse than udp

would it make tcp act more like udp if you only ever sent really small discrete packets and did all the ordering reordering stuff yourself on the other end

is there a way to have tcp act more like udp

in gaming especially fpss udp tends to be the chosen protocol because it s much less chatty than tcp

udp is less reliable on a wide area network but in a closed environment of a vm talking to its host you can safely skip all the tcp reliability stuff

i was going through internet and so and understood that web sockets are encapsulations to tcp which by itself is slower than udp ofcourse at the cost of reliability but i couldnt find much info if websockets or udp would be ideal to implement such a server

tcp windowing is more expensive than raw udp but if you use udp to go faster and add a custom loss-recovery or seqno ack resend manager then that may slow you down again

note i m currently learning udp and how effective a voip system would be in comparison with a tcp system i ve already done tcp so please no one comment tcp is better etc

even the tcp extensions to the ice specification note that tcp connections are much less likely to succeed than udp connections between natted peers

i ve considered that udp is more suitable for sending a series of discrete data sets but i need the reliability of tcp

note that there are exceptions to the above - for example tcp generally traverses firewalls better than udp which may be blocked due to security to traffic policy reasons so voip speech may sometimes be sent over tcp for part of its journey at least

tcp has bigger overhead than udp because it needs to add more data to your payload but you are guaranteed that your data will be received in it s destination in the order you sent it and not corrupted

tldr tcp ip is more reliable than udp but not a 100 iron-clad guarantee that nothing will ever go wrong

for example tcp has much more flags window-length syn ack etc - and also starts and ends a connection in a very stable way - the three way handshake - while all udp has is source ip dest ip length source port dest port and checksum

for instance zeromq can leverage udp multicast to run faster than any tcp protocol but the application programmer doesn t need to learn a new api

on the foundation you have either udp which is unreliable but incurs almost no overhead but very well suited for broadcasts and tcp which is more reliable therefore has more overhead but is easier to use

as far as tcp goes i think tcp is more generally used protocol for more data-centric requests like chat or things that require packet integrity udp tolerates packet loss to lower latency

the downsides are that it is unreliable messages can be dropped or corrupted therefore you may want to add some safety and that some isp may restrict udp more than tcp test yourself to be sure but usually there is no problems

in fact i recently did a study testing this and it found that snmp over udp succeeded far better than snmp over tcp in lossy networks when the udp timeout was set properly

udp is unreliable and tcp is more than adequate in sending 1000 s per second

and wikipedia says that snmp can be run over tcp ip but udp is more common

please note however that this architecture implements tcp which is much slower than udp and will not work for any type of fast-paced data intensive games but should accomplish your goals given your description above

i ve read in the past that having udp mixed in with tcp causes udp to drop far more often and tcp to slow down just the same

the fact is not all routers support this scenario and always require port forwarding for udp traffic tcp traffic is easier because there is an on-going connection the router can maintain with the client

tcp is subject to higher latencies than udp as it requires the client to send back packet confirmations

with regard to using send versus sendto i have found that sendto is used more commonly with udp and send with tcp sockets

in practice this means that tcp is better suited for continuous transmission of data whereas the more lightweight udp can be used when reliability isn t important

also remember that dns requests can use tcp if the request or response would need more than 1 udp packet

the mtu is closer to 1500 and this applies to tcp not udp

instead you can use udp and implement your own scheme for verification of data that is less stringent than tcp

minimum bandwidth use tcp will add more header bytes to the actual message then udp as tcp is connect kind of communication socket type and also has internal check-sum

it seems like udp will more efficient than tcp

alternatively it can be used over udp which is less hungry than tcp

also note that it is easy to implement your own stack on top of udp that performs worse than tcp

sockets can work as could udp multicast careful there though no way to know if a message was missed which is why tcp sockets are safer

it may be that the kernel heuristics for servering tcp connections is more aggressive than for udp sockets since tcp connections require more state and more continuous processing than do udp sockets

2 tcp needs more processing at network interface level where as in udp itâ s not

there are a number of reasons to build such a protocol - nat evasion using udp hole punching finer control over congestion control algorithm selection or simply avoiding tcp s message reordering when the order in which messages are received is not important this can help reduce latency


faster reliable slower
udp is generally faster than tcp as it does not have to do the overhead checking of consistency that tcp must deal with

udp is faster and requires less bandwidth than tcp

this is the reason why udp is much faster than tcp

i was expecting that udp would be faster but tcp is on average two times faster than udp

maybe one of you guys already sees a problem in the code snippets or have any other suggestion or hint for me why my udp transmission is slower than tcp

if the query itself and the response are small a few bytes consider using udp instead of tcp it s faster and you can use lower values of sendinterval

udp is faster than tcp because packets are sent without guarantee of delivery nor order

use socket for tcp and datagram for udp its a lot faster than tcp but less connection oriented

udp packets are easier structured than tcp packets but sacrifice security for their size

in some applications tcp is faster better throughput than udp

udp protocol is unreliable but much much faster than tcp which is most commonly used for communication

at my company we have found memory mapped files to be much faster than loopback tcp ip for communication on the same box so i m assuming it would be faster than udp too

i was going to use reliable udp but tcp seems more appropriate

we propose to use udp over tcp since udp is faster than tcp

tcp as you know udp is faster than tcp even if udp may miss some

for a simple installation tcp will be faster and simpler than trying to implement your own reliable udp

1 tcp is connection oriented and reliable where as udp is connection less and unreliable

udp is not always faster than tcp

tcp is slower assures data arrival udp is faster data corruption may be possible

udp is extremely faster than tcp which is suitable to stream a user s voice input

only when packets can be discarded unordered can udp be faster than tcp

udp is significantly faster than tcp and is why it is or was used for video and various things back in the day

i don t think you should make the assumption that udp is faster than tcp

udp is a connectionless protocol which has zero error-checking it is that is the trade-off with tcp it is faster than tcp

one can say udp has a lower overhead than tcp because its packets have a smaller header and therefore take less bandwidth to send the payload the data

4 tcp is a slower than udp

tcp is certainly going to be more reliable than udp since udp doesn t guarantee packet delivery which is probably why you application is hanging on the receive

because of tcp requires connection and provides security it is slower than udp and therefore it should not be preffered during a video streaming

in doing so the tradefoff is that tcp becomes slower compared to udp

the speed for tcp in comparison with udp is slower

i know that in practice this would only happen with a great amount of connection given that processing time of an udp connection is faster than tcp but it could potentially happen

as a general rule udp is faster than tcp due to less protocol overhead

udp has less overhead than tcp and is therefore faster

i read in a case where a stream of 300 byte packets was being sent over ethernet 1500 byte mtu and tcp was 50 faster than udp

note that udp is more difficult to work with than tcp because packets are not always guaranteed to be delivered

udp is significantly easier do you really need tcp btw

because there is no confirmation on udp packets it s slightly faster than tcp

with a cable that can hold c packets s and tcp at a rate of c packets s and udp at a rate of 8 c packets s udp would be much faster

i know tcp is a safer choice but let s assume i can only use udp and i need to ensure i can send packets over at a high rate with no missing packets what should i do

from experience i can tell you udp is about 10-15 faster than tcp on dedicated and udp-tuned networks

the reason i asking this is because i read tcp is slower than udp because tcp ensures order of packets

in that sense reliable udp cannot be faster than tcp

also see this other so answer about the misconception that udp is always faster than tcp

tcp is a slower more reliable protocol than udp is

that among other things is why tcp is considered more reliable but slower than udp

the problem with using tcp is obviously that it is a lot slower than udp

and there are no handshakings required udp are pretty much faster but less reliable than tcp

tcp mounts are more reliable and you know you have a network problem much faster than with udp

what i have thought of so far is that tcp is going to be more reliable than udp and in rmi corba we want network reliability

with tcp its slightly slower than udp and has more features

i m trying to avoid tcpclient because udp is faster but would this work in tcp since it s streamed

tcp has to do a lot of error checking to ensure that your packets don t get dropped and so tcp is much slower than udp

tcp is reliable but slower than udp while udp is not safe and i have to implement my own fault-handling codes

udp is way lighter and faster but somewhat less reliable than tcp

tcp is but udp is faster

udp is quicker than tcp but if you re using quickfix you ll be using tcp

i know udp is faster than tcp for various reason

udp is much faster then tcp but tcp has flow control and guaranteed delivery

a udp stack is considerably simpler than a tcp stack

tcp - more reliable than udp but this comes with some overhead there is a distinct connection a better match for games which require less frequent data transmission such as turn based games as is your game

if i d directly say that udp is faster comparatively than tcp that it is used for such applications

tcp is a bit slower than udp but more failsafe

one often finds the argument that udp is faster then tcp

the reason udp is faster than tcp is because there is no form of flow control or error correction

i assumend that the transmission using udp have to be much faster than using tcp but in fact my tests proved that the udp transmission is about 7 to 8 times slower than using tcp

if there is no parent child relationship consider named pipes made with mkfifo 3 or af_unix sockets see unix 7 and scoket 2 .... which are bidirectional af_unix sockets are much faster than tcp ip or udp ip on the same machine

isn t udp working faster than tcp usually

i suppose this is one of the reasons for the misconception that udp is slower than tcp

don t think of it as udp is faster and tcp is slower because that s just wrong

for example i read an experiment in which a stream of 300 byte packets was being sent over ethernet 1500 byte mtu and tcp was 50 faster than udp

udp might be faster than tcp but it doesn t have the error detection and correction you are going to need in order to have a safe transfer of data

tcp is faster for when using a few connections the important difference is that modern nics perform significant amounts of acceleration on tcp and not really that much for udp

here is what i am thinking tcp is supposed to be reliable transmission but slow whereas udp is does not provide a guarantee of packet transmission like tcp but is faster than tcp

tcp ip is supposed to be more reliable than udp ip see this comparison

http is an application layer protocol which could be encapsulated with a protocol that uses udp providing arguably faster reliable communication than tcp

i would like to change it so you can send files however udp does not support this and tcp is slower than tcp

i have guessed udp would be faster than tcp due to tcp s three-way handshake scheme but are there any other considerations which need to be made

i though that udp was faster than tcp but do you think that tcp will be faster due to the congestion

what s currently baffling me is in my results tcp finishes almost 2x faster than udp

i know that udp would be much faster but it needs to be reliable at the same time hence i m looking for tcp

tcp is much slower than udp but when the two machines are not on the same lan udp is not reliable

most importantly you can easily supplement udp with some reliable delivery hand-shaking that s less overhead than tcp

udp should be much faster than tcp because there are no acknowledge and congestion detection

try to increase timeout value tcp is slower than udp

tcp is slower than udp and you ll have to mitigate that in realtime multiplayer


lighter
if you can do everything with udp it is lighter than tcp

yes udp is much much lighter than tcp


secure decision protocol
i know that udp is connectionless protocol and tcp may be a better option but i have to use udp as the client side sends the packets over udp

the decision on yours the tcp protocol used for connection oriented network that is more secure than udp


packets faster congested
if the data is critical you should go for tcp which is slower as compared to udp which in fact doesn t guarantee the packets will arrive in order or even if they d arrive or not

in a congested network yes udp will send its packets faster than tcp this is because tcp takes then congestion into account using a mechanism called congestion control

is sending packets via an established tcp connection after all hand shaking has been done a method to be faster than udp

i am using udp because it is much faster than tcp but sometimes i need the know for sure if the packet reached to the other side in my program i can not use tcp at all so i am sending ack packets


quick acronym reflexes
udp is great if you plan to have your client for the game account for missing information by using approximation most fps games do this as well as just about any game that requires very quick reflexes where tcp ip is simpler will greatly reduce errors in transmission and be more prone to lag

so both can use quic instead of tcp and it s usually faster than tcp hence the name which sounds like quick and is an acronym of quick udp internet connections


traversal nat easier
it was introduced since the nat traversal for tcp is much more complicated than udp

but it sounds like you want to do nat traversal over tcp which is a harder problem than udp

as such traversing a nat through udp is much easier than tcp

keep in mind that implementing udp traversal is easier than tcp

you could probably also configure snmp to run over tcp instead of udp which makes tunneling easier


work likely reliability
udp is also more work than tcp if you need reliability which is built in to tcp

tcp socket is even more likely than udp socket but both work


simpler protocol lucky
c++ is not my first language and this is small part of code i can t figure out i ve chosen udp because it is always much simpler than tcp

you can use udp as well but if you are dealing with firewalls it is probably going to be simpler with tcp

udp sockets are much simpler then tcp ones

also sending receiving data over udp is much simpler than over tcp and it does not require any connections

you ve struck lucky with the requirements - because you re going from udp - tcp it s actually a lot simpler than doing udp - udp

the fact that udp s header size is less than tcp s is because is a simpler protocol that needs less header space that s all there is to it

but with the udp protocol in particular this is easier than for tcp

udp is simpler protocol than tcp and you can still simulate features of tcp using udp


hand fail-safe one
i think it s related to the specific router implementation because on one hand if a udp packet disappears then both sides probably know it might happen and can afford to lose a packet or two but on the other hand if a tcp packet disappears then by it s fail-safe mechanism it will send another and the problem is solved and tcp packet is much heavier

i know that it uses a custom http based application layer protocol so one might think its tcp but on the other hand it is a broadcast application so udp would be more logical to me


complex instructions complicated
+ consider that the implementation of tcp stack is much more complicated than udp more instructions are executed there

in my experience udp based code is generally less complex than tcp based code

some protocols are more complex because what s needed are some but not all of the features of tcp but more than what udp provides


simple faster window
for fps games or other games where network speed is essential you ll probably want a udp connection seeing how it doesn t have the same level of network package verification as tcp making it faster and then write your own protocol on top of it to ensure packet validity to achieve maximum connection speed

udp is faster than tcp and the simple reason is because its nonexistent acknowledge packet ack that permits a continuous packet stream instead of tcp that acknowledges a set of packets calculated by using the tcp window size and round-trip time rtt

in a native application i would use udp for the most data player position ... because it s way faster than tcp and it s uncritical when it is lost

udp is really faster than tcp and the simple reason is because it s non-existent acknowledge packet ack that permits a continuous packet stream instead of tcp that acknowledges a set of packets calculatd by using the tcp window size and round-trip time rtt .

also if you have very limited memory processing resources it is worth bearing in mind that udp is a less costly protocol as it avoids a lot of the overheads tcp incurs due to its inbuilt connection management

apart from that tcp packets by themselves are not slower than udp packets and data transfer with a simple tcp connection can be faster than with a simple udp connection because flow control and reliable transfer is already integrated and you don t have to reinvent everything again and often worse

the communication between the android app and the pc can rely on a simple tcp socket udp is also a valid option but if you begin in network programming tcp is probably easier to handle and more widely used


bigger smaller issues
the problem is that tcp creates bigger packages of data while udp uses 8 kb of data blocks

udp gives smaller latency with many many issues to discuss here of course tcp gives bigger latency

the package is bigger than udp s package but smaller than tcp s package


harder scanning port
when writing your server bear in mind that the sequence of events for a tcp socket is much harder than for a udp socket since as well as the normal socket and bind calls you also have to listen and accept

udp port scanning is possible but it is harder than tcp scanning


tidyverse	lubridate---------------------------------------------------

others
lubridate is another package from the tidyverse it makes easier work with dates and times


splash	interstitial---------------------------------------------------

others
i am showing interstitial ads inside my app and admob wants me to show a splash screen before showing interstitial to make it more user friendly


rss	feed---------------------------------------------------

api search ideal
if necessary i am willing to use the twitter api directly to do the search instead of using rss but for my purposes using a feed is more ideal

google does this because their feed api can parse more than rss


others
those are well-known formats and extracting informations from such xml feed would be much easier than getting it from an html page with rss atom you ll just have to parse the xml feed and extract the tags that contain informations that interest you

i m using php to process rss data however often feed have more than image in the description

the specification of atom feed offers more value than the rss one with internationalization content types and other things and every modern feed reader supports it

your first option might be to search for a wordpress rss widget for external websites alternatively if you want to be more customised about how you retrieve the rss then one way if your using .net is to use system.net.webclient and system.web.webrequest fetch and cache the result and then you can parse the feed using xmlreader syndicationfeed classes

from experience i ve found real world feed are often more complex than the rss parser can handle

you d gain compatibility and durability because rss is more defined things will change less but if the feed doesn t include what you need it won t help you

that will result in your feed looking even more garbled than it already does because the php will be double-encoded once for the rss xml and again for the html contained in the rss xml

as you noticed yoou cannot create an rss campaign feeded by more than oone feed

and as an aside if you re trying to get the list of articles on your blog reading the rss or atom feed might be easier though i suppose it might not have all the info you need


better job facebook
better than twitter feed is engator - rss to twitter and facebook

google s services that generate feed generally do a better job at producing atom rather than rss


easier fwiw faster
i ve been working with rss quite a bit and have found that atom feed are typically easier to parse using the rsssyndication class

the atom feed option seems to load faster than the rss one fwiw


qvboxlayout	qwidget---------------------------------------------------

others
the center widget is a qdockwidget containing a qwidget with a qvboxlayout containing more stuff


fgets	atoi---------------------------------------------------

others
so here fgets is reading more than one integer at a time from file so atoi is not getting the integers in file too


cstdio	iostream---------------------------------------------------

others
for those commenting that cstdio is obsolete personally i like it more than iostream

yes iostream is slower than cstdio


profiling tool ones
slower than the cstdio ones and extensibility iostream allows

iostream is said to be slower than cstdio but i suggest you use a profiling tool here to find the best set of options here


jsonb	hstore---------------------------------------------------

others
i admit that gin index on hstore is much more expensive than its equivalent for jsonb but even then it is faster to just do seq scan on hstore than use index on jsonb

also assuming someone figures out the difference union functions for jsonb arrays or text arrays would the bulk updates for hstore perform significantly better

json jsonb fields support any json-encodable data type not just key value pairs but also tend to be faster and for jsonb more compact than hstore


qlist	qmap---------------------------------------------------

others
this relates to another question i asked a while back at size of qt containers is qmap much larger than qlist


profiler	gprof---------------------------------------------------

others
for time measurements use google s cpu profiler it gives way better results than gprof


wav	flac---------------------------------------------------

comment better ogg
i also know that it can deal with flac better than wav and ogg

regearding your comment i also know that it can deal with flac better than wav and ogg that is not really the case


others
it is a high level 2d and 3d cross platform windows mac os x linux sound engine and audio library which plays wav mp3 ogg flac mod xm it s3m and more file formats and is usable in c++ and all .net languages c# visualbasic.net etc

flac is smaller than wav


murmurhash	md5---------------------------------------------------

others
murmurhash has 64 and 128-bit versions so you can experiment between the two and it s faster than md5 largely owing to md5 being a cryptographic hash function whereas murmur doesn t have the added expense complexity of being cryptographically secure i m assuming that you re not concerned about anybody attempting to intentionally generate hash collisions or anything like that

but as that reference points out murmurhash is way faster than md5 and sha functions although it doesn t do a direct comparison to the object.gethashcode method i mentioned above


ssl	socks---------------------------------------------------

others
since socks proxy is in theory nothing more than a ssl tunnel i thought i could give that property another try

anyevent http resolved several issues i had with my program locking up and also offered better control over ssl cert validation and use of proxies including socks proxies


vb6	vba---------------------------------------------------

others
in vb6 at least so i assume it s true in vba replace is faster than concatenation

fortunately the vbide for vb6 has more classes and methods for working with vb projects than the vba version of vbide

vba is in fact a superset of vb6 not a subset -- vba has more functionality built in than vb6 itself

vba being a whole lot less than vb6

you can often get better results by searching vb6 which is almost the exact same thing as vba


led	adc---------------------------------------------------

others
it should turn on a led if the adc value is more than half of max


imagick	gmagick---------------------------------------------------

others
imagick is more resource hungry than gmagick but when i tried to use gmagick it is not working properly

gmagick is newer version of imagick with more set of features it is less resource intensive and fast but the problem is there is very few discussion about this wonderful tool on web i recently came across this on

update graphicsmagick is faster than imagick doesn t means gmagick is better than imagick


equals	tostring---------------------------------------------------

others

inefficient map result
the same result can be obtained also by comparing tostring of each map as you suggested but using equals is a more intuitive approach

tostring itself uses an iterator just like equals but is a more inefficient approach


opera	google-chrome---------------------------------------------------

browsers major mode
it s way faster on ie but other major browsers firefox google-chrome safari and opera perform better when using a container and then appending it fragment or div

this code to date is only supported by a couple of the major browsers namely google-chrome 37 and opera 24 see more details here

since you noted thoughts on other browsers would be helpful opera s kiosk mode seems more powerful than google-chrome s

fireofx google-chrome safari and opera has better css selectors support compare to ie

on all of the other browsers i ve tried safari opera ie google-chrome it looks much less nice because all of those browsers scroll half a screen at a time


others
safari and opera work with the google-chrome setting but firefox and ie display the iframed page larger than google-chrome causing part of the text to be cut off

works in google-chrome firefox a bit weirdish blur effect on hover opera ends look smaller safari ends look smaller

now this works fine in google-chrome and safari and i have had to use assitional css settings for firefox but ie and opera both display my ribbon div about 25px higher than in google-chrome or safari

also nice to know is the fact that the latest version of google-chrome and also opera don t know since when but longer than google-chrome supports userscripts out of the box no need to install any add-ons

according to w3counter ie6 is used by more people than opera safari and any version of google-chrome

opera probably is more complete to manage canvas than google-chrome but the problem is always to exclude the finger touch if i m using the pen

google-chrome recent builds only and firefox are behaving very strict in this regard no matter how much content you have it will be no bigger than your viewport while opera presto behaves more like a table 100 is treated as a minimum not a maximum

google-chrome took more than 14-times more time to complete than opera

the second happened when you remove everything and starting type and hit enter different browsers behavior very differently google-chrome insert very first line as a just text node of contenteditable container and than put every new line into div opera 12.12 handle it better and it never allows remove last div node ie9-10 starting jump around and after you started again uses p tags instead of div that s not even such a disaster just inconsistency but yet the firefox is not yet even trying to change it s br behavior

in any case vorbis clearly has the most coverage google-chrome has more of the market than safari now opera is about half of safari and obviously firefox is huge and it doesn t really have the strong opposition that theora has

usually you want to avoid solutions from browser-vendor as they ll cater toward that specific browser but opera webkit google-chrome safari firefox devs are usually more knowledgeable in terms of cross-browser solutions and compliance with the standards than m ones

especially in opera there is much more green in the painting than in google-chrome

as you can see in the image google-chrome is running a lot longer than opera

answers in opera was checking browser support for my page and wanted to search some stuff up. i don t get this message in my default browser google-chrome nor in internet explorer or firefox

note i recommend using opera - it is much faster than google-chrome as it doesn t have memory leaks and comes with a built-in ad blocker

for comparison 0.68 usage means this outdated google-chrome release is more popular than the current and previous versions of opera the penultimate version of safari on ios and ie 9 or 10

firefox just provides far more access to its own internals and system to the extensions so its technically possible to do more with them than with opera widgets or google-chrome extensions

well unless you re targeting older than google-chrome 1.0 firefox 8.0 ie 4.0 opera 7.0 or safari 4.0 it s safe to use insertadjacenthtml

i have already run into problems with old javascript code which i thought was standards compliant by firefox or opera standards - which are pretty good but google-chrome was even more picky


bigger ie7 div
according to some - browser - statistics ie6 market share is still bigger than google-chrome safari and opera together nearly as much as ie7

on your screenshot div width in opera is bigger than in firefox and google-chrome


higher text linux
in safari it is several pixels higher up than in firefox and google-chrome and significantly lower in opera

on linux google-chrome displays text about one pixel higher than firefox and opera


browser faster slower
the idea is that if they are using ie then they must install google-chrome frame and if they are using less than firefox 4 or opera 11.5 then they must upgrade their browser not not sure if the way i am doing that is correct

it seems to be slower in google-chrome and firefox but is significantly faster in opera

much better than opera firefox and google-chrome

conclusion diff1 is faster in firefox opera and safari diff2 is faster in ie and google-chrome

the results varied from a browser to another firefox 4.0b12 is faster using but google-chrome webkit and opera is faster when using

using any other browser google-chrome firefox and opera it s much quicker


rouge	pygments---------------------------------------------------

others
also redcarpet and pygments were no longer available so they must be replaced by kramdown and rouge in _config.yaml

note that at time of writing rouge has lesser language support compared to pygments


terminate	timeout---------------------------------------------------

others
the process spawns another processes and threads but all are terminate and joined much sooner than timeout

maybe its your grasp of english which is the problem but its the lifetime of the connection time between connection opening and closing you need to worry about more than the timeout length of time with no activity after which the connection will be terminate

i distinguish between long runtimes method terminate and hard timeout - the hard timeout are longer and meant to catch the case when code does not terminate at all as opposed to being slow

for tcp the timeout can be much larger since tcp connections are usually terminate by an explicit fin fin-ack exchange

but it seems barring any bugs in the code of the two that if your java connection client has a timeout set lower than the default heartbeat for couchdb continuous changes then the connection could get terminate by the java client

but the problem is that i need to terminate a process if it lasts more than a timeout 3 seconds


window requests error
you can also supply a timeout for these requests meaning any requests that run longer than the timeout window will be terminate after all

if this works it will terminate requests taking longer than the timeout by raising a timeout error and such requests should generate transaction traces in new relic


thread second message
i start the calculation in a new thread join it to the main thread with a timeout set to say 1 second but the main thread still keeps on waiting for the calculation to terminate which takes significantly longer than 1 second

if the file is huge and computation takes longer than the timeout the worker thread is terminate an error message is shown and no intraline difference is displayed for the file pair


try-catch	exception-handling---------------------------------------------------

others
try-catch rsources is fine for some cases but this is the old way and works better when you have more than 1 exception-handling in a block

when you call input.nextline as part of your exception-handling catching is it better to place it into every catch block or just inside a finally block at the end of the try-catch

wrap your code in try-catch to get more info on the exception-handling

so here the unchecked exception-handling is better to use in order not to copy and paste all that ugly try-catch block rethrowing an exception-handling and add the throws clause to the method

your colleague may be right in the general sense using try-catch to test your exception-handling handling is less desirable than using the provided expectedexception utilities

in a project i am creating now i use several try-catch clauses and i would like to display a popup message in case of an exception-handling to make it more user friendly

when there are more than one exception-handling in try-catch block rec_catch_exception triggers

also whether this is really the problem or not you can wrap your facebook requests with a try-catch block to catch facebookapiexception type exception-handling to get more information when you have errors

i use try-catch blocks when the potential exception-handling are more complex or more numerous

in general try-catch is more robust does not require you to define an exact position of where to test could be a block and provides info about the exception-handling

there s no way anyone else can know anything more specific about your exception-handling than you already do and the best way to investigate is use try-catch and create more robust error handling

if you really want to catch exception-handling and die slightly nicer you can put a try-catch block around the application.run call and work from there

additionally you may have to write nested try-catch blocks more frequently if you are using traditional try-catch . closing a resource also throws an exception-handling

if raiseweberror re-throws the exception-handling this will then be handled by the next try-catch block found futher up the call stack the parent method you refer to

if the application can run even if that exception-handling occurs make the try-catch block wrap a smaller more relevant part of the code and let the buttons initialize

or depending on the use case and generally less clear especially if you have more than one exception-handling expected - you don t want to have try-catch imbrications...

the try-catch is needed because sometimes it will throw a exception-handling if the securitymanager dont allow the thread to sleep but dont worry thats will never happen..

if it s not the case then i believe it is much better to isolate the different code blocks throwing different exception-handling into different try-catch blocks sandwitching do more stuff here that does not throw exception-handling

will hide the exception-handling and since dealing with exception-handling is heavier compared to a simple if t why isn t the normal new t not considered less good practice considering we will have to use try-catch to check if a simple allocation succeeded and if we don t just watch the program die


slower if-clause faster
try-catch is actually slower if there really is an exception-handling thrown

in java you can call option s isempty isdefined and get without any special hassle the really useful option methods such as getorelse are another matter. checking the result of the isdefined method in an if-clause should be faster than checking exception-handling in a try-catch block


better output constructor
going beyond that you can use a try-catch block to gracefully handle those exception-handling and provide better output logging options

if you are writing a constructor which could throw an exception-handling you had better make sure you clean up anything you need to by using using or try-catch block


starttls	smtps---------------------------------------------------

others
you can still have an encrypted connection with the smtps server by using the smtp_ssl class without needing the starttls call shorter


box-sizing	border-box---------------------------------------------------

others
if all you want is to include a padding then you can achieve the same thing with the box-sizing attribute set to border-box that has far better browser support

jeff kaufman has a good demonstration of how box-sizing works and why border-box makes more sense


qplaintextedit	qtextedit---------------------------------------------------

others
if you want to display your file as plain text the widget qplaintextedit is better then qtextedit

i have tried connecting the qscrollbars but the maximum of the qplaintextedit is smaller than the qtextedit s


do-while	break---------------------------------------------------

others
if you want to break this convention then perhaps changing it to a do-while loop is more appropriate


ecdsa	rsa---------------------------------------------------

others
from the central authority point of view ecdsa also allows better performance on my pc using a single core openssl crunches out more than 6500 ecdsa signatures per second in the p-192 nist curve and only 1145 rsa signatures per second with a 1024-bit key

ecdsa is much faster than rsa for private key operations so it should definitely be preferred over rsa when high efficiency is required unless rsa is still fast enough something that may very well be the case

rsa is much faster then ecdsa at verification


greater size strength
for the signature part you may want to use dsa or ecdsa they yield much shorter signatures typically 320 bits for a dsa signature of security equivalent to a 1024-bit rsa signature

dsa and ecdsa both produce shorter signatures with much greater strength that rsa

if you re interesting in reducing the size of the resulting cookies you should consider using ecdsa rather than rsa to produce the signatures - ecdsa signatures are considerably smaller than rsa signatures of an equivalent security factor


merb	ruby-on-rails---------------------------------------------------

others
this will be made less onerous by ruby-on-rails 3 which is intended to be orm agnostic after the merge with merb


arraylist	linkedhashmap---------------------------------------------------

others
after a few test hashmap linkedhashmap and treemap are way slower than arraylist and i wanted to use them just for the ability to create submaps

it gives me arraylist but arraylist has a linkedhashmap which contains some more linked hashmaps containing final values


expandablelistview	spinner---------------------------------------------------

others
you cannot directly use an expandablelistview for the spinner popup any more than you can directly use a listview for the spinner popup


vertica	greenplum---------------------------------------------------

others
the storage costs in hadoop are much cheaper than vertica netezza greenplum and the like


notepad	textpad---------------------------------------------------

others
on windows machine i would probably go with textpad personally i now use programmers notepad 2 however it does not support a spell checker and i don t really thinks it s better than textpad by any measure

as it happens my choice is textpad but just about anything which is more advanced than notepad ought to be able to do this


pyenv	virtualenv---------------------------------------------------

others
pyenv operates on a wider scale than virtualenv - it holds a register of python installations and can be used to install new ones and allows you to configure which version of python to run when you use the python command

there are other tools on top of virtualenv like pyenv which are easier to use

python versions you install using pyenv go into its directory by default pyenv root is .pyenv so are more global than virtualenv


expander	grid---------------------------------------------------

others
other features i am looking for grid are paging row expander to view more details selection change event sorting bind xml json data and search within grid

my intention is to have each group as an expander but with a margin either side so as more groups are added the grid columns become squeezed more into the centre


openmpi	mpich---------------------------------------------------

others
it seems openmpi has better support for assigning ranks than mpich but setting up slurm and mpich wasn t trivial due to the cluster setup so i m hesitant to start over with openmpi

while openmpi supports more connection protocols there is an infiniband-enabled version of mpich called mvapich


nunit	mstest---------------------------------------------------

better support good
he concludes that nunit wins for unit testing but mstest has much better abilities for integration based testing and team testing with team system

nunit has better support for parameterized tests than mstest

various people told me to go with nunit since it s better than mstest apparently i have no idea and it also has very good support in resharper which i m using

although several ci tools such as teamcity have better support for nunit probably would change as mstest becomes more popular

example with nunit i have better experiences with nunit than with mstest


others
sriwantha mstest is a simpler framework than nunit

if you have a full version of visual studio 2008 rather than the express edition it integrates the inbuilt mstest much better than nunit does and cruise control also supports mstest

for example nunit offers more assert methods than mstest

thus i suspect when people say that nunit is much faster than mstest it is because of the loading and updating delays but the actual test execution time appears to be very similar


speeds testdriven.net instrumentation
the best testdriven.net disables all instrumentation that mstest does so it makes mstest blazing fast - much faster than nunit for example

nonetheless i tried to compare the sum of all test speeds and in some cases nunit is faster and in other cases mstest is faster


mbunit features bunch
i ve read time and time again that tdd test first is more difficult with mstest than it is with other testing frameworks such as nunit mbunit etc.

nunit is more widespread mbunit has the most features but mstest has more manpower behind it

mstest is missing a bunch of features that nunit has and nunit has been around longer is more mature


slower faster
from my experience mstest is much slower than nunit

nunit is faster as compared to mstest


portrait	landscape---------------------------------------------------

others
my problem with this is that the calculation works fine in the portrait mode but as soon as i switch to landscape mode the distance between bottom and button is bigger than in portrait mode

portrait mode can display more rows than in landscape mode

now my doubt is when i rotate it to portrait mode from landscape mode since the width of the textblocks present inside the itemtemplate of listbox is already defined when i rotate the it to portrait i am not able to see all the data present it cuts off since the width of the portrait mode is less when compared to landscape mode

in landscape it has more buttons in addition to what is there in portrait mode

in portrait the spacing is decent but in landscape mode i feel like the graphs should be bigger and take up more space than in portrait mode which is simply not possible with the tab bar and navigation bar

the differences between layout is the content.when i am in landscape i display more informations than i am in portrait

the amount of spacing to the right of the uiview when in portrait mode is greater than i want for landscape mode and the distance from the bottom is less than i want for landscape mode

obviously i want in portrait view the content area of this iframe to be smaller than in landscape

i noticed that when i flip my phone from portrait to landscape everything gets bigger

and the rest depends on you you can scan barcode in portrait mode but it take time longer or you have to change orient of screen to landscape to get result faster

i had an outlet of a viewgraph which was a subclass of uiview in which i drew some graphics.in landscape mode the size of the viewgraph is larger than in portrait mode

i have to set it to 4em to make the h2 approximately twice the size of the 1em p in portrait but in landscape it is much bigger

portrait mode sets the smaller side as the width and larger side as height for example 9 16 landscape the sets the larger side as the width and smaller side as height 16 9

by default new android project have basic folders for portrait orientation .create a folder layout-land and drawable-land for landscape screen.put your layout xml file in layout-land and required image for that screen in drawable-land

portrait is taller landscape is wider

your imageview in landscape is smaller than portrait

i encounter the same issue and notice the crash happens if the original shared element is no longer visible on the previous screen when you go back probably it is the last element on screen in portrait but once switched to landscape it s no longer visible and thus the transition has nowhere to put back the shared element

on an iphone compact in landscape mode the status bar is hidden and the navigation bar height is less than in portrait

in crystal report if i set a user defined size as 4ã 6 it sets the page landscape as height is less than width due to this printer prints page on landscape mode i want it in portrait

currently i m using only the portrait orientation for all devices but the portrait orientation looks better on phones meanwhile landscape orientation looks better on tablets

the action icons are centered in portrait mode whereas the toolbar in landscape mode is higher and the icons are not centered

for example when rotating from portrait to landscape the collection view bounds value still has its height greater than the width

i want all of the images to fit inside the width of the text area which will change dynamically with the window size and i want them all to be the same height meaning of course that landscape images take up more horizontal space than portrait ones etc

issue you re experiencing with a video working in landscape but not portrait sounds more like an issue with the email client than your code

or the tableview is covering it up because the landscape view has less vertical room than the portrait view

when phone is in portrait mode entering more than 10 lines does not hide the button behind the keyboard.however when phone is in landscape mode entering around 3-4 line hides the button behind the keyboard.can anyone help me explain why this is happneing

changing your phone s configuration from portrait to landscape would mean more options menu items could be displayed on the action bar thus items present in the overflow menu could now be moved to the action bar itself

everything works ok on almost all phones and tablets graphics on landscape are smaller and when i back to portrait graphics are again bigger

as long as landscape means wider than taller and portrait viceversa it means to read the image into memory and check width and height

there may be a better way to do this but a quick and dirty method would be to inspect the display s width and height with display.getsize point point - if the width is greater than the height then normal mode is landscape otherwise portrait

i would advice to check if the width is bigger than the height of the picture taken landscape picture and if that is the case show an alert to the users to explain that just portrait pictures are supported

i m trying to shy away from using max-width because some android devices in landscape are wider than an ipad in portrait and i was getting collisions where a device would incorrectly identify as an ipad based on a set width

landscape pages can be created in 2 ways set a width larger than the height or set the page rotation to 90 or 270 degrees for a portrait page

one page is a page of which the width is smaller than the height sounds like it s a page in portrait but as there s a rotate value of 90 added to the page dictionary it is shown in landscape

and then while loading each page i am checking orientation if it is portrait then adding two more gesture up and down gesture if landscape then removing up and down gesture

the printer sees and feeds them as portrait no rotation but the report viewer prints them landscape because the width is greater than the height

this is a conflict on tablet ipad portrait width 768 and mobile phone landscape width 768 but height is smaller around 400 only in which cutting the height of images co z i need to keep the images width 100

in portrait mode your phone screens is smaller than that so screen_is_narrow is true whereas in landscape mode and on tablet it is wider and thus screen_is_narrow becomes false

it s because you re using and orientation portrait so once the width of the window has a higher value than the height none of your css will be taken into account because it s considered landscape orientation at that point

when i change device mode to landscape i want larger ytplayerview then in portrait mode

the difference between a min and max dimension can be very large as the given area covered by a landscape cell is much wider and shorter than a portrait cell

because in some devices it may possible that portrait screen size is less than 1024 and landscape have greater than this limit

or what happends if we swap from portrait to landscape we have much more space yet it won t be used since we hardcoded 300.0

but the only thing i get is that the activity is still in landscape but the rectangle now is smaller with the portrait dimensions and the camera becomes weird because the image is rotated 90 degrees and moves down when i move the phone left and up when moving the phone right

i would have hoped to see that the landscape can fit more content than the portrait but this is not the case see below that is all it allows me to add

the only problem with that is that it over-rides the 980px to 1024px media queries designed for ipad landscape and forces ipad landscape to display the smaller layout i designed for ipad portrait the 768px to 979px layout

the table cells in portrait took up the width of the view and in landscape were made somewhat higher but less wide

portrait has an aspect ratio greater than 1 1 and landscape is less

this results in each landscape photo occupying less than half the area as the portrait photos and basically treating them with less importance

when i draw a 3d cube in opengl es for android it seems to look fine as long as i m in portrait mode but when i switch to landscape it looks more like a diamond

if uiscreen mainscreen knows that i really want the height to be greater than the width whether or not i actually do how can i either query the actual dimensions or query whether the device is in portrait mode or landscape

without more detail it s hard to say why your approach doesn t work but my guess is that you are seeing the sprite positioning you describe as a result of the fact that if you don t change orientation the lower left in portrait is the lower right in landscape when rotated left it s the same point in gl space 0 0


order math parameter
you may try to listen to uideviceorientationdidchangenotification within your subclass cell to rotate the webview and within your view controller with the table view and run a -reloaddata on your table view in order to properly resize the cells assuming the landscape webview is way higher than the portrait webview

i would recommend to check which of width or height is bigger in order to know if you are in portrait or in landscape and adapt your math to this parameter


lesser space fitting
as landscape has lesser space than portrait you are able to view only top scrollview so only that portion would be scrollable

i guess you are able to see the complete layout in portrait just because portrait layout is having more space and your complete layout is fitting well but landscape is having lesser space


ones photos taller
i am trying to make all a row of 4 images all have the same height size i already tried to play around with the width and height using css but nothing seems to work the portrait images always end up taller than the landscape ones here s the code

as you can see the bottom two photos landscape so have been rotated are narrower than the portrait ones at the top


change orientation keyobard
it is quite interesting since you are in portrait view but when keyobard is shown width of the available screen is higher than height and that change orientation to landscape

this demo illustrate the change from landscape to portrait using css orientation when the window height is higher than its width

i have this doubt i have a menu in which i run a javascript code or another depending on whether its width is greater or less than its height works me well the first time the screen resolution is detected but if there is a change of resolution or a change of orientation does not detect it and despite for example of having changed to portrait orientation still executing the landscape orientation code


width height mode
if you resize your browser window to still have a viewport with a with equal or less than 1024px but have an height greater than your width the viewport is no longer considered to be in landscape mode but switch to portrait mode

because in landscape your height is smaller than in portrait you need to have a value smaller than 1.0

and i want to show the video in the landscape mode if the height is greater then the width of the phone otherwise to show the video in the portrait mode

such that a landscape image would have an ideal height of 300 or slightly larger with a width 400 and a portrait image would have an ideal width of 400 or slightly larger with a height 300

it s a bold meaning that its width is greater than its height which makes its portrait view a landscape

the following works perfectly with my phone in portrait the width fits but when i flip to landscape the width still fits perfectly but the images are longer than the height

if window height is bigger then window width the we have a portrait or in any other case we have a landscape orientation

but the screen always gets rotated to landscape instead of being set to portrait when the width is smaller than the height

some images are portrait orientation some are landscape all are larger than the desired render size

this gave the uiimageview a portrait size greater height than width even though the app is locked in landscape mode

if the height is longer than the width the screen is in portrait mode otherwise it is landscape

if you set the width to lower than the portrait width and set the min-width to 100 then you sill get width 100 but this time a version that actually works and now the iframe takes the actual container width and not the landscape width

its because the height of the screen in portrait mode is more when compared to height of the screen in landscape mode

also your css for .character has the width 170 narrower than the height 245 which would be a portrait view but your example shows a landscape view

if you think about a moment this is exactly what you want - to know if width is smaller than height portrait the opposite landscape or if they are the same square

it will adapt the video frame height to landscape mode and it will play the video in the landscape mode whether or not a portrait mode is more suitable

however if you want to redesign your layout or make adjustments based on wether the screen is in landscape width is larger than height or portrait height is larger than width mode you can definitely use css media queries

take screenshot of rotated screen and while uploading turn the dimension to portrait if their dimension is landscape i.e width is greater than height

the bug occurs if the input has a width that makes it wider than the portrait width when in landscape mode

i have report with width size is bigger than height size like landscape but set to portrait in format - page format ireport

the program s label changes dynamically so when the width is greater landscape mode it s label has a different text then when the height is greater portrait mode

the third url works fine when the image width is larger than the height landscape but when the height is the largest dimension portrait it resizes the height correctly but the width dimension does not get padded to fill the 600px width but instead becomes whatever size is calculated to maintain the aspect ratio

then you can write separate css for width less than 650px portrait more than 650 landscape

if the height is higher than the width then you can say it s portrait or else landscape

so in the case if i upload 2 images i want to check if the images are portrait height is greater the width or landscape and need to show the images accordingly

you have this issue because height in landscape mode is lower then in portrait

it works as as desired for landscape image width greater than height however for portrait it automatically rotates image and interchange width and height without any flag to get if any rotation has been done

you are using the screen size to generate your placeholder image and the width of the screen in landscape is bigger than portrait

topbar portrait height is bigger than topbar landscape height everywhere except iphone 6 plus

or continuously check the stage width height in onenterframe update and if height is bigger than width portrait else landscape


dynamic-languages	compiled-language---------------------------------------------------

others
because you can determine what code in a compiled-language is likely to do better than a dynamic-languages it has been determined more error free to use a compiled perspective for more things so as you can see with the availability of offset-management and lookup compiled behavior given to you in core perl there is no reason to mess with the symbol table if you don t have to


graphlab	pandas---------------------------------------------------

others
i m using the module graphlab in my python script and many more such as pandas and numpy etc graphlab module only works on python2 not for python3


matplotlib	canopy---------------------------------------------------

others
another even simpler option than canopy and anaconda is just to download spyder s dmg which comes with the latest versions of numpy scipy matplotlib pandas sympy and the sci-kits


multiton	singleton---------------------------------------------------

others
however when using the enum version of the singleton pattern would the multiton not allow for more than one object of the class to be created


yacc	sablecc---------------------------------------------------

others
javacc yacc are sablecc are more traditional lexer parser generators and you ll find that they re a little more primitive and have steeper learning curves


startapp	interstitial---------------------------------------------------

others
imo startapp is better than admob especially when using their interstitial ads


air	flashdevelop---------------------------------------------------

others
if you re unsure which version you have or you are targeting a version earlier than air sdk 3.2 you can download the latest air sdk pre-merged with flex sdk from adobe s gaming site download the adobeâ airâ sdk save it to disk and link its location to flashdevelop


illegalstateexception	runtimeexception---------------------------------------------------

others
normally custom runtimeexception are a bad idea because they can result in leaky abstractions but here a custom type in place of illegalstateexception may make it cleaner for you to distinguish your timeout exceptions from runtimeexception raised by the student s code


dynamic-languages	typechecking---------------------------------------------------

others
if anything i would imagine scope and availability through passed params in a dynamic-languages would be considerably easier to establish without the typechecking concern


tstringgrid	tdbgrid---------------------------------------------------

others
use an in-memory dataset clientdataset as teran suggested in the question comment thread you can still present your large data to a tstringgrid if using it is compulsory but a tdbgrid is more appropriate


mp3	flv---------------------------------------------------

others
both formats flv vs mp4 can contain exact same data h.264 video with mp3 or aac audio but mp4 is supported in more devices software


octal	hex---------------------------------------------------

others
hex or maybe octal depending on the machine being emulated will be clearer than using decimal since similar opcodes tend to vary in bits not digits

hex is used much more often than octal

from what i understand octal was more popular than hex among users of 18-bit architectures since a word would be exactly 6 octal digits

hex is easy octal is even easier to convert to and you dont need to do the backward thing for a quick check can reverse it by hand after you see the result

apparently octal format was more popular than hex format

the octal encoding mechanism is less error-prone than hex so i ll demonstrate using octal

of course you could do the same with octal but hex is even more compact than octal.


qwindow	qwidget---------------------------------------------------

others
qwindow is more low level than qwidget


sum	floor---------------------------------------------------

others
this formula fails for integers whose sum is an odd -ve number as their floor is one less than their average


tapestry	sitemesh---------------------------------------------------

others
i have used sitemesh and it is good for wrapping a set of pages in standard headers and footers but tapestry is better for creating components which are used on many pages possibly many times per page


firefox	safari---------------------------------------------------

background filter wider
firefox renders the video correctly and it matches the background and in safari it s always brighter whether you add the filter or not

in safari the background of my menu navigation drop-down menu s is much wider than in google-chrome firefox


explorer internet strict
also i m guessing that firefox ignores this issue and just and compensates for it while safari may be more strict in its implementation of the code so it doesn t compensate

it seems that google-chrome internet explorer or safari are more strict than firefox on terms of security

i am using franklin gothic font for website and font looks good on google-chrome and safari but on internet explorer and mozilla firefox it looks darker

with firefox google-chrome and safari it s less of an issue because those started auto-updating years ago and more than two years ago they stopped blocking methods other than get and post

firefox internet explorer and safari have better options though

font looks sharp in google-chrome safari ie8 not as good as other 2 but less fuzzy than firefox


browsers better closer
now i recognized that safari make more problems then the other browsers like google-chrome or firefox

i planned on using svgs for the entire site but with only 20-30 svg images of medium to high complexity used in the page and google-chrome already seems to be showing som jank and high paint times for scroll and firefox is even worse though safari seems to do a lot better

firefox is just better for web development and i prefer safari overall

therefore code should be written and tested around firefox google-chrome safari which are much closer to proper standards support than ie8 then conditional tags should be used in ie to work around its bugs

this does not seem to occur in safari or ie and a similar permission error occurs sometimes in firefox but is reproducible more often than not in google-chrome

in ie and firefox fullscreen_block appears closer to the bottom than in safari and google-chrome

please especially test on safari because it has some more problems than firefox and google-chrome

safari behaves better than firefox but an error message â œone error in opening the pageâ â shows up in the status bar if you remove the iframe during the load event

it s way faster on ie but other major browsers firefox google-chrome safari and opera perform better when using a container and then appending it fragment or div

the service is still in beta trial and firefox conversion is working better than safari one

after that ie slows down at exponential rate when firefox google-chrome and safari are doing much better

if you are trying to support all users on all browsers then you will certainly need to do testing on those browsers although actively developing on those browsers may not be necessary whereas if you only need to support webkit-based browsers google-chrome safari or webkit-based browsers and firefox that is less testing that you need to do

whether you use a plugin or write your own code css only is a no go for google-chrome safari and as you said firefox is better at dealing with it

secondly the browsers above ie7 and other browsers like firefox google-chrome and safari have a better rendering engine and intuitively handle buggy markup

all the webkit-based browsers safari google-chrome and opera should be closer in their rendering to each other than firefox or ie 9 separately


text middle space
to me it looks like safari gets it more right than firefox text is generally more around a middle line

it displays ok in google-chrome and safari but in firefox it has more space between the text and the bottom border than between the text and the top border


fine assitional links
now this works fine in google-chrome and safari and i have had to use assitional css settings for firefox but ie and opera both display my ribbon div about 25px higher than in google-chrome or safari

pc google-chrome and safari are fine ie shows the links like in the picture firefox shows more revealed urls


faster slower execution
fast clicking on ie has slower response than firefox google-chrome and safari

in safari we found that the dom level 0 took twice the time off the dom level 2 but was still four times faster than either firefox case

this makes firefox 50x faster than google-chrome and 70x faster than safari is there any known reason for that

google-chrome or safari on a mac could be much faster than firefox on a pc especially with newer apis

when i try the demo in google-chrome or safari it is indeed much faster but when i ve tested it in firefox it s consistently slower

incidentally the scrolling on the windows version of safari is fine albeit a little slower than ie opera and firefox

safari 4.0.3 was 2.5x faster than tracemonky in firefox 3.5.3 on win xp

on safari everything is slower than on firefox still the object property access is more than two times faster

firefox google-chrome safari all have prioritized faster javascript execution in recent versions whereas ie may show performance in ie9 i hope they do myself. also realize this slideshow will run slow in mobile devices etc

to my surprise firefox 6 and safari 5 are faster just adding a bunch of strings together than using .join

conclusion diff1 is faster in firefox opera and safari diff2 is faster in ie and google-chrome


others
the compatibility table link shows google-chrome firefox edge and safari are more compatible than babel now

i d support both ie still has a big chunk of the user space with firefox and others opera safari etc.. occupying a smaller percentage of the browser market

the height of the blue bar in safari and google-chrome matches but in firefox it is smaller

using proprietary extensions from firefox is almost as myopic -- you ll have a hard time convincing all visitors to switch to firefox for your site from ie safari or whatever else they prefer and although the range of devices on which you can install firefox is broader than those on which you can install ie you re still cutting off devices such as iphones and android a segment of the market that s growing much faster than traditional pcs

in particular a font may be rendered quite differently between the various browsers and operating systems in current use - safari and macos use more anti-alisaing than firefox or ie but ie9 has a new feature called cleartype which also affects font rendering

the only thing is that flexbox is not supported by older browser support by ie10+ google-chrome 20+ safari 3.1+ firefox 2+ read more about support so i probably would need to add the flexie polyfill to support this on older browser

it seems that ie and firefox are less strict than safari

firefox recognizes this attribute but webkit google-chrome safari etc don t more info on caniuse.com

works in google-chrome firefox a bit weirdish blur effect on hover opera ends look smaller safari ends look smaller

in my opinion you re already testing far over the top - ie firefox google-chrome safari already corner more than 99 of the market in pc mac form

firefox 4+ and safari 5+ have much stronger html5 support and don t require the above css.

in safari it renders significantly brighter than in firefox or google-chrome

is it possible to adjust rendering of svg content on safari and google-chrome to resemble more firefox rendering

it worked perfectly with google-chrome but safari 5 and firefox implement a more recent version of the websocket protocol and cramp does not so i couldn t get it to work there

so if something works on safari it s more likely to work straightaway on google-chrome more than it is on firefox - but that s just a family resemblance at the end of the day you ll still have to test each as every webkit browser product and version still uses a different version of webkit

let s say you wanted a table border-radius of 50 on google-chrome and safari but firefox is adding more padding by default so you d like to tone it down for that browser alone to 45

this happens in firefox and also in google-chrome cells shrink less in google-chrome but not in safari

for example try hiding a dom of of 200+ children in google-chrome vs safari vs firefox you will notice google-chrome takes 20+ sec safari takes 5+ seconds firefox takes less than 1 second

fwiw i was able to solve my problem with greensock using tweenmax to animate individual paths inside and this worked in firefox gecko and webkit browsers safari google-chrome it does a better job of calculating the origin not exactly sure how but it worked for me

well unless you re targeting older than google-chrome 1.0 firefox 8.0 ie 4.0 opera 7.0 or safari 4.0 it s safe to use insertadjacenthtml

i had created the website www.suezre.com and when viewed in google-chrome or firefox figcaption on the pictures looks good but on safari it takes much more space

apple s safari applies almost no cross domain restrictions to files opened locally but firefox is much more strict about what it permits with google-chrome somewhere in the middle

i ve been trying to sum up values over a swipe and see how different browsers report values and they vary a lot with safari reporting order of magnitude bigger numbers on almost all platforms google-chrome reporting quite more like 3 times more than firefox firefox being balanced on the long run but quite different among platforms on small movements on ubuntu gnome nearly only +3 or -3 seems like it sums up smaller events and then send a big +3

third in my experience going from safari to firefox is usually less problematic than the other way around

i also have .js files being redirected to javascript engines as well for main.js in google-chrome it tries main.v8.js in safari main.nitro.js in firefox main.gecko.js

firefox allocates lots of memory during that preloading up to 20-30 times more than google-chrome or safari do and even twice as much as ie

small in firefox is smaller then small in safari so never ever use them

i just tested geolocation on firefox 3.6 and iphone safari os 3.1.3 the result is interesting firefox is more accurate than safari

in firefox it takes some more time compared to google-chrome safari

use firefox network in development tools and check your requests sometimes it just sends options request in cross origin i insist on firefox because it s network tool is much more detailed than google-chrome and safari

not really any more than safari having cookies and firefox having cookies are somehow tied

i saw that the discrepancy was because in safari the text element is taller than in firefox and includes a slight amount of whitespace on top that doesn t show up in firefox in firefox the top of the text element is exactly when the text starts

but do keep in mind you re optimizing for a particular js engine when you re doing that v8-optimized code might generate cleaner memory in google-chrome and safari but for all you know ie might make a complete hash of things or some of the tricks you ve used cause firefox to slow down more than a fairly large array would have done in the first place

firefox for example has a lot in common with google-chrome and safari and google-chrome and safari are even more so closely related

the downside is that you cannot use it for browsers older than ie11 firefox 31 esr safari 7.1 ios 7 konqueror all versions and opera all versions

but i haven t yet figured out whether it s me writing sloppy code with firefox perhaps being more forgiving than safari or if it s safari or if it s jquery

it looks like while google-chrome and safari are trying to do the right thing with 0px firefox is sticking closer to the standard

the center align property must be cascading from some other element because it s not only safari google-chrome which also uses webkit but also opera that shows the things center aligned and both safari google-chrome and opera are more standards compliant than ie and even firefox

in any case vorbis clearly has the most coverage google-chrome has more of the market than safari now opera is about half of safari and obviously firefox is huge and it doesn t really have the strong opposition that theora has


great worse better
it works great in google-chrome and safari haven t tested ie but i m sure it s somehow worse than firefox

firefox google-chrome opera and safari all handle it better


resolution positioning bigger
this is because in ie and firefox the footer link text is larger than in google-chrome and safari therefore the margins that i ve set up for the icons do not work

that i gave to every link in the set of links home about us products contact and it seems that firefox is making that 1px margin much bigger than safari or google-chrome and distorting it

open up the fiddle in both firefox google-chrome to see what i m talking about - in firefox the positioning of the background image is much lower than in google-chrome safari

while the rest of the browsers report the correct width of the document firefox reports a smaller one example at screen resolution of 1920x1080 ie google-chrome and safari reports 1920 while firefox reports 1903


lower greater pixels
in safari it is several pixels higher up than in firefox and google-chrome and significantly lower in opera

in firefox it seems that this is 1px lower than in google-chrome and safari

so to specify firefox greater than 20 safari greater than 9.1 and ie greater than 9


page setting iframed
safari and opera work with the google-chrome setting but firefox and ie display the iframed page larger than google-chrome causing part of the text to be cut off

ie is less performant than safari google-chrome and firefox when it comes to js - but have you really developed a page that is unusable in ie with js turned on


qregularexpression	qregexp---------------------------------------------------

others
qregularexpression and i m much more familiar with qregexp


gif	png---------------------------------------------------

better compression mode
as a general rule png is never worse and often better than gif because of superior compression

you can then use imagecopy to insert each gif image including the background and imagepng to generate png output which is better for line art than jpeg offers better compression than gif and can support more than 256 colors

png is capable of every image mode of gif apart from animation and when using the same image mode png will have better compression due to its superior deflate algorithm compared to lzw

but in that regard it is replaced by png which is generally smaller supports alpha transparency where gif pixels are either fully transparent or fully opaque and most importantly gif images are limited to 256 colors


bmp map webp
gif jpeg png bmp are more standard than any vector format where usually adobe has the market

jpg jpeg bmp png webp gif svg js map ico css less scss


others
just press save and give it a name and that photoshop image will be saved into a transparent background png file which presents more colors and it s smaller than a gif file and is as good as a jpg

paul points out that png compresses static line art better than gif for nearly every situation

if you find png files are larger than the equivalent gif files then you re saving the png in 24 bit color and the gif in palette mode because a gif is always in palette mode

so this script will take a jpg gif of png image resize it to 110px width if width is greater of 110px height if height is greater

bear in mind that the conversion is not trivial if the png is true colour or has transparency gif is more limited

still most simple gif usually are much more smaller in footprint compared to their optimized png version

the gif format is substantially less capable than png

also if i change all to png is not bigger and alos i am using prawn pdf outputting these images so cant use gif

a 8-bit png shim is smaller than the same dimension 1 pixel gif and everything will still work as planned

gif jpeg and png are more complex - the data is compressed

png achieves better compression than gif because it applies a pre-filtering step before the lossless compression deflate roughly equivalent to lzw. see wikipedia s explanation of png filtering


smaller color palette
gif is smaller because it s based on an colour palette of 256 colours rather than the separate rgb values for each pixel or group of pixels in jpg and png

if png isn t smaller than gif then your software may be saving it poorly - look for png optimisation progams like pngout and pngnq

since that appears to generate index-color gif files which are smaller than the png files that doxygen generates

one thing to note is that gif supports a smaller palette than png - only up to 256 colors

now i want to show an error message when the image isn t a png jpg or gif or is larger than 250k

icon size indexed png is often smaller than the same gif

indexed png less than 256 colors is actually always smaller than gif so i use that most of the time

convert it to png 10-30 smaller than gif on average

after pressing it about twice there is a smaller and smaller delay between the gif being set and the png being set

png has a wider color pallete than gif and gif is properitary while png is not

but keep in mind that the gif color palette is way smaller than png


uglier strings likely
note that if you convert your png files to gif images they are likely to look uglier as gif files can only have 256 colors and do not support alpha-transparency

but in my search i found that png images return shorter base64 strings than gif images


better format file
png gives you better alpha result than gif

for non-animated gif images a conversion to png8 should be painless and beneficial as png compresses much better

animated png is better than gif if we re focused on file size â achieving a smaller file size was one of the reasons the apng format was designed

jpeg is bad at that kind of thing and you ll probably find png to compress better probably better than gif too

for storing line drawings text and iconic graphics at a smaller file size png or even gif are better choices because they are lossless

for example given gif may be deprecated in a system because png has proven better for the system s users - perhaps because it supports better colour depth preserving the colours more accurately or svg might be deprecated because some clients have been found to be using web browsers that won t display them jpeg might be deprecated because it s known the images in the system aren t natural photographic images and the format gives visually poor results despite larger compressed files slower processing speed and higher memory usage - lots of possible motivations for making things deprecated

according to wikipedia the png format provides better compression than gif

png is a newer format and often better than either jpeg of gif - especially for screenshots

there might be some edge cases where gif is slightly better because the png format may have a slightly larger overhead from metadata but it s really not worth the worry

png compresses much better than gif and allows more colors at the same time

for example png has better support for transparency than gif or jpeg

while png is definitely better that gif occasionally there is a use case for needing to stay in gif format

png images are always compressed lossless but their compression algorithm works better than competition gif

many people don t know about 8-bit png which is usually better than gif in size.

png does everything except animations unless enhanced with apng that gif does and better


file size files
i m not sure if this matters but the gif is significantly larger than the png files

wewtaco i noticed that your png file has wider dimension than the gif file and i am guess that could be a reason the black bars are showing up

png files have a larger default pallet however you can shrink their color pallet so that when you do they result in a smaller file size than gif

i used gif because its file size 2.1kb was considerably less than png or jpeg in this case

i wasn t aware that png should be any worse in terms of file size than gif

it might help to reduce your gif file sizes smaller oh and i believe -depth 8 can only be used for png images

if your png files are coming out larger than equivalent gif files it is almost certainly because your source image has more than 256 colors

this properly means if the file is an image of gif or jpeg or png and is less than that size

jpg and png work well for most applications but the files will be larger than gif for very simple graphics


rational-numbers	fractions---------------------------------------------------

others
and most importantly all decimals stored on a computer are terminating because in a computer a decimal fractions is not much more than a rational-numbers m n with n being a power of 2

if all rational-numbers could occur maybe the representation as fractions would be better since it is always finite


do.call	tapply---------------------------------------------------

others
or is the do.call with by just typically much slower than tapply


tortoisegit	svn---------------------------------------------------

others
nobody has ever accused git of being easy-to-use no tortoisegit for example although i hear it s coming so you might be better off with svn beanstalk

the compare dialog of tortoisegit is more about file and with git you have to compare two master branches not just two commits of the same branches both pointing to the same svn central repo


marmalade	bada---------------------------------------------------

others
cocos2d-x already works with marmalade so if you want to take your cocos2d game to ios android symbian webos bada rim qnx and more check out marmalade


column-count	height---------------------------------------------------

others
try with 1 column-count and as text get bigger than available height it will auto split in to second column - columns 1 150px

the problem is that when there is some fixed height opera generates more columns than specified in column-count instead of adding scroll


haskell	agda---------------------------------------------------

others
i ve heard people complaining about haskell s type system having holes and that agda and ocaml coq are better

coq is probably the most prominent language of the style but agda has a more haskell-y feel as well as being written in haskell itself

another popular language that offers more power than haskell is agda - i don t know agda beyond knowing it is dependently typed on hackage and well respected by people i respect but those are good enough reasons to me


free	strdup---------------------------------------------------

programmer convenient strlen
you should know that strdup allocates more memory and returns its pointer which you then overwrite the original pointer returned by malloc so it will be impossible to free that memory since you no longer have the pointers

in c memory most other things are managed by the programmer so strdup is no worse than forgetting to free malloc ed memory failing to null terminate a string using incorrect format string in scanf and invoking undefined behaviour accessing dangling pointer etc

additionally if you have strdup then it is much more convenient than strlen + malloc + strcpy with identical result including the same obligation to free the allocated storage when you no longer need it


others

armadillo	lapack---------------------------------------------------

others
edit in response to the comment armadillo does not require lapack but works better with it and better still with tuned blas


fileoutputstream	filechannel---------------------------------------------------

others
i don t see any reason why filechannel could be any faster than fileoutputstream in this case


uniq	comm---------------------------------------------------

others
sort | uniq is good but comm might be even better


serializable	deserialization---------------------------------------------------

note quicker deserializing
the serializable seems quicker but deserialization much slower and the app is doing more deserializing than serializing

note that while serializable is now optimized deserialization is doubly slower because i deserialize to object to then reserialize to string


others
i ve reworked it slightly so that the deserialization code looks more like its serializable counterpart

if the taskproperty class is decorated with datacontract attribute and with datamember attribute for each property the deserialization is much faster than when it is decorated with serializable attribute

deserialization is harder than serializable

i have an issue with serializable in c# .net where if i serializable in one stream multiple references to a same object these references are no longer equal after deserialization

side note check-out the json.net serializable which gives more options and better control over the deserialization process

here s code demonstrating how to serializable like you want however deserialization will be more tricky because it s not straightforward to deserialize into an existing instance see how to use xmlserializer to deserialize into an existing instance

if i understood your need correctly i believe you have two options - register multiple de serializable or put more logic into your deserialization implementations

is there a serializable library or some way that i can have deserialization be less strict like if there is an extra field added to the class then it just fills that with null upon deserialization of the old version of the class

davidxxx was indeed right that deserialization was only failing when the serializable number was greater than long.max_value

i don t have any experience with serializable but i was expecting deserialization to be faster than normal processing at least for the cpickle module

instead of bson deserialization i see more critical how the to_json method handles the serializable of date and time ruby object

you ll need to implement serializable to have java handle the serializable or externalizable if you need more control over the deserialization process


hebrew	persian---------------------------------------------------

others
i am not sure it can satisfy you but hebrew test is 4 times slower than persian


initializer	class-method---------------------------------------------------

others
the simplest thing is probably to define b with a nice straightforward initializer with the same signature as a uses and then additional factory functions defined as class-method to do the more complicated scenarios

static class-method often allow cleaner code and save you from initializer redundant objects


sse	avx---------------------------------------------------

others
when i can use sse3 or avx are then older sse versions as sse2 or mmx available -

also note that the fact that the avx are a newer than sse doesn t make the avx faster whatever you are planning to use the number of cycles taken by an function is probably more important than the avx vs sse argument for example see this answer

you should look into avx the new instruction set extension that evolves sse to support wider vector units

i think you re saying that avx was less of a speedup over sse on your ivb

the underlying reason for this and various other avx limitations is that architecturally avx is little more than two sse execution units side by side - you will notice that virtually no avx instructions operate horizontally across the boundary between the two 128 bit halves of a vector which is particularly annoying in the case of vpalignr

i expected avx to be about 1.5x faster than sse

i know this does not answer your core question why avx is slower but since your ultimate goal is fast popcount the avx - sse comparison is irrelevant as both are inferior to the builtin popcount


math routines cpus
before the avx routine runs all the tests are around 80-130 faster then fpu math as can be seen here after the avx routine runs the sse routines are much slower

for small buffers hot in l1d cache avx can copy significantly faster than sse on cpus like haswell where 256b loads stores really do use a 256b data path to l1d cache instead of splitting into two 128b operations

so congratulations - you can pat yourself on the back your avx routine is indeed about a third faster than the sse routine tested on haswell i7 here


version values papi
single threaded sse operations are faster than single threaded avx operations

so the avx version does indeed appear to faster than the sse version both for the original implementations and the optimised implementations

the question is avx scalar is 2.7x faster than sse when i vectorized it the speed up is 3x matrix size is 128x128 for this question

now for sse is clearly faster and for the smaller values it s nearlly as fast as avx

as expected the performance got better with both and avx 2 faster than sse 4.2 but when i profiled the code with papi i found out that the total number of misses mainly l1 and l2 increased a lot

i have code that does the same thing but the avx version is considerably slower than the sse version


scatter	graphing---------------------------------------------------

others
graphing by adding one more scatter plot let me know if there is better idea

one way that has been suggested for this in the core plot framework was to create two scatter plots within a single graphing have the higher one use a colored fill then have the lower one use a fill of the same color as the background of the graphing

using line graphing types would work but i d rather not as i have potentially hundreds of series and scatter points are clearer


scalacheck	quickcheck---------------------------------------------------

others
my guess is that scalacheck being initially written as a 1-1 mapping of quickcheck makes it easier for haskellers to jump into scala

scalacheck s api is also a bit richer than quickcheck s api


qtkit	avfoundation---------------------------------------------------

others
since apple has decided that qtkit is no more and avfoundation appears to only support prores 4444 and 422 flavors how are developers supposed to write modern software that can handle 4444xq 422lt and 422 proxy


hide	fadeout---------------------------------------------------

others
note the show hide effect is much softer because of the commented fadein fadeout declarations that were triggering console errors probably because jsfiddle uses jquery slim now

or more ideally you might want to change show hide to jquery fadein fadeout which is more appropriate for back to top indicators

fadeout is simpler because it will hide it for you automatically when it is done so you can save that code and it automatically waits for the animation to be done before hiding the element something your current code was not doing

according to this test - hide is slightly faster then fadeout since it doesn t use animations


nsdatadetector	uitextview---------------------------------------------------

others
you can read about nsdatadetector to get more info about it it can detect phone numbers mail adresses etc. the uitextview often detect some by defaults


writetofile	nsdata---------------------------------------------------

others
rather than using the quite primitive writetofile method of nsarray i d recommend to use nspropertylistserialization in conjunction with nsdata s writetofile options error still better writetourl.


cube	skybox---------------------------------------------------

others
i recently switched from unity to unreal and the first thing i wanted to do is create a skybox but the only thing it seems to support is a skydome which has far more polygons than a cube and the generated .dds cubemap files are far too huge to be used in webgl projects


org.json	jackson---------------------------------------------------

others
p.s. my recommendation would be to remove jsonobject conversion and instead return an object of actual class as internally spring uses jackson which is more powerful json framework then org.json


nashorn benchmark takeaway
quick takeaway of the benchmark jackson performs 5 to 6 times better than org.json and more than twice better than gson

or switch from org.json to something that performs better such as gson or jackson

in this case jackson performs better than nashorn which performs much better than org.json


qtwebengine	qtwebkit---------------------------------------------------

others
i ve also noticed that qtwebengine is significantly faster and more stable that the old qtwebkit based widgets

unfortunately qtwebengine has much worse and poorer integration with the rest of qt facilities than qtwebkit


bitwise-and	modulo---------------------------------------------------

others
in this particular case you concluded that a bitwise-and operation of c++ language must be implemented by a bitwise-and machine operation while a modulo must somehow involve machine division which is allegedly slower

i read in couple of blogs that in java modulo reminder operator is slower than bitwise-and

for large numbers would using a bitwise-and operation be more efficient for determining the parity of a number whether it is even or odd than using the modulo


uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller---------------------------------------------------

others
i am writing an app based on uitabbarcontroller which has more than 10 viewcontrollers with corresponding uinavigationcontroller

add one more uinavigationcontroller between uitabbarcontroller and uiviewcontroller


uiviewcontroller read-only current
there is only a read-only property of the uitabbarcontroller called morenavigationcontroller that points to a uinavigationcontroller

basically if the user is on a view under the more tab the actual current uinavigationcontroller you want to use to push a uiviewcontroller onto is the uitabbarcontroller s morenavigationcontroller property


addition	modulo---------------------------------------------------

32-bit compilers operations
it is true that division and modulo a division operation is slower than addition

the addition is much cheaper than other operations like modulo and division and array access

implementing multiplication and division might be more costly than you would like but at least addition is easy modulo protecting against over underflow and you claim to not need any operations so even better

division and modulo are indeed costly hardware operations whatever you do this is more related to hardware architecture than to languages or compilers perhaps ten times slower than addition

for example on most 32 bit systems 64-bit addition is faster than 32-bit division modulo

performing addition on this slightly larger type will pretty much always be faster than doing division or modulo on the type itself

integer multiplication division and modulo are much slower than integer addition and subtraction

then you can process any length number using very few division remainder modulo operations which is important because they are much slower than addition


others
the result of the addition was better than the modulo the by 0.0070000 milliseconds over the course of 2 million or 200 000 iterations

is the modulo really weaker than the addition


divide-by-zero priority higher
because the string formatting operator shares precedence with the remainder or modulo which binds more tightly than the + addition operator

modulo can also cause a divide-by-zero and it has a higher precedence than addition

note parentheses are redundant as division and multiplication have the same priority and modulo has higher precedence over addition

multiplication division and modulo have the same precedence and they all have higher precedence than addition and subtraction

and keep in mind that the modulo has a higher precedence than addition and subtraction

the modulo has a higher precedence than addition

the modulo has a higher operator precedence than the addition operator therefore it will happen before the addition


content-length	content-type---------------------------------------------------

others
but like mattias said you d probably want some data in the body as well so you d want the content-type and the data as well plus content-length would be larger

by default it compresses responses whose content-type belongs to default_compressables and whose content-length is greater than 200 characters

...web api relies on system.net.http library for getting request headers and this library gives a null for httprequestmessage s content.headers.contenttype in this case and web api sees that content-length is greater than 0 but no content-type header and hence returns a 415 unsupported media type

in addition if you have few data to send using get will url-encode the data this means that the number of generated sent bytes will be higher than the data size itself while post will consume more byte in general because the request will additionally contain a content-type application x-www-form-urlencoded header likely a content-length header plus the same url-encoded data as get


waitpid	fork---------------------------------------------------

others
as for the suggestions in the comments keeping the fork result in a variable a then waiting with waitpid is safer when you have more processes as wait waits for the first ending process not a particular one


tostring	string.format---------------------------------------------------

others
for formatting a single numeric value tostring is marginally more efficient than string.format because string.format has a bunch of overhead to parse the format string out of the curly braces and then pass it to tostring


extjs	gxt---------------------------------------------------

others

overhead speed gwt
if the added overhead of all the extjs libraries are too much for you in gwt-ext then the gxt project from extjs may be more your speed

i have worked pretty heavily with both flavors of the gwt extjs libraries though i ve spent more time with gxt recently


bottle	flask---------------------------------------------------

others
and if you need to manage lots of routes easily you can use klein or flask microframeworks or even bottle to make it easier and simpler for you a simple minimal usage example for using klein would look something like this

i am using bottle but i am going to want to use https and support for https under flask seems much more straight forward

bottle is rather faster than flask

either will do the trick but bottle or in my preference flask will be faster as it is much more lightweight than django

i d totally go with flask unless one dependency bottle is better than three flask jinja2 and werkzeug


bufferedreader	fileinputstream---------------------------------------------------

others
see the referred post for an example that reads a single file in parallel with fileinputstream which should be significantly faster than using bufferedreader according to these benchmarks

bufferedreader is useful when is used with large streams such as a file fileinputstream and in all cases the read method returns one character while behind the scene bufferedreader reads more data depends on buffer size from related inputstream and caches it to improve performance


migrate	staging---------------------------------------------------

others
its not necessary and will potentially introduce bigger issues as you migrate your code to staging and production regions


tidyverse	tidyr---------------------------------------------------

others
we can use tidyverse extract from tidyr to split group into group and decision then replace the group value to 1 if the percentage extracted the number with parse_number from readr is greater than or equal to 90


rtp	sdp---------------------------------------------------

others
internet telephony is a lot more than sip - rtp rtcp sdp on-device audio handling etc.


margin	text-align---------------------------------------------------

others
using margin 0 auto or an inline-block div with a parent with text-align center are both better bets

the text-align center is for old ie6 whereas margin works for newer browsers


rvm	bundler---------------------------------------------------

rbenv-gemset results favors
bundler is a better way to manage application dependencies. there is a plugin rbenv-gemset for getting the same results as rvm s gemsets but sam clearly favors using bundler instead

you can also read up on how to make rvm work with passenger 3 it might be transferrable to 4 with gemsets though in my opinion using bundler deployment is much better option


others
rvm supports more then just .rvmrc one of this files is gemfile with either the bundler directive to specify ruby

there is no need to do anything to make bundler work with rvm but there is one thing about bundler that makes it harder to use


jruby	mri---------------------------------------------------

others
the last together with the loading of the jvm makes mri better for short ad hoc scripts jruby better for process hungry longer running processes with methods repeated often so jruby would be better for running servers and services

with mri i d use forking with jruby there s more of a case to be made for threading

the jruby runtime alone is already pretty heavy much heavier than mri

in fact on windows jruby passes more rubyspec tests than ruby meaning mri or yarv itself

alter your command path so that jruby s version of the ruby command has a higher priority than the mri one

i ve noticed however that jruby is more sensitive to memory leaks than mri


slower old matz
and it sounds strange but jruby scales very well and it s faster than mri with java 7

mri was faster than jruby

does this mean that the old adagio about jruby being faster than mri ruby is gone

this really surprised me because i expected mri to be slower than jruby

so it seems like the opposite - mri 2.3 gets 2-5x slower than jruby 9.1

jruby is faster than 1.9 mri matz ruby interpreter the standard in certain areas

mri is faster than jruby


rubies global efficiency
works on some rubies better than others jruby and rubinius are recommended efficiency on mri is decreased due to gvl global vm lock

works on some rubies better than others jruby is recommended efficiency on mri is decreased due to gvl global vm lock

in practice this means that deploying a rails app to jruby is a good idea as is running your integration tests but for developer unit tests and scripts mri yarv or rubinius are better choices


requests raw execution
once the jvm has warmed up rails requests under jruby are usually significantly more performant than under mri both in terms of raw execution speed and garbage collection

same passenger + mri 2.3.0 is 3 times faster than puma + jruby on same rack app

jvm hosted languages are generally going to be faster than traditional mri ruby and both java and scala are generally faster than jruby when it comes to raw cpu capabilities

mri has a gil so why is it faster than jruby in handling requests


better processes warmup
if you are set on using ruby you might want to compare mri to jruby from my experience with the latter and profilers like jvisualvm i wouldn t be surprised if jruby fared better

with these options jruby on rails gives about the same or better performance than mri

i know that rails jruby handles concurrency better than mri but i don t know how to do it

for longer-running applications like a web application rubinius or jruby will generally perform better than mri

sometimes mri is faster but with the right parameters and warmup jruby was 3 to 3.5 times as fast on my system for this particular

lastly if you are frequently finding yourself running long running process i advice you to try jruby which is works much better with long running processes due to jvm lot faster than mri


imagemagick	libtiff---------------------------------------------------

others
ghostscript and imagemagick convert should also be able to do this for you although libtiff is supposedly quicker


popupwindow	dialog---------------------------------------------------

others
i give up using popupwindow and use dialog instead after some tests i found dialog is far better than popupwindow there are quite a few problems with popupwindow

every time i want to show popupwindow in front of dialog fragment the dialog is in front of the popup.i assume that dialog have higher priority in view tree.is there any option to bring my popupwindow to the front or send dialog to back.bringtofront is not working when it s called on view detailslayout


tax	shipping---------------------------------------------------

others
if you are sending stuff there are a lot more considerations than just shipping costs you may need to fill in specific tax forms for some countries and depending on what your site is selling you may need special processing for some countries try sending coffee to thailand -- you need to obtain permission from thier ministry of agriculture


slug	permalinks---------------------------------------------------

others
i want my permalinks to be accessable via more than one slug

slug will work too but permalinks would be better i want to set it to a different domain


lua	moonscript---------------------------------------------------

others
note that there several advantages to leaving the lua code duplication generated by moonscript in your lua files at least for oft-used operations class definition is probably not one of them but moonscript does way more than that


indexof	hasownproperty---------------------------------------------------

others
however i ve seen that object s hasownproperty is much faster than indexof


vfork	posix---------------------------------------------------

others
both old and some modern systems implement a special vfork call which has somewhat strict limitations although less strict than the posix requireemnts for vfork but avoid this copy for performance reasons


mako	genshi---------------------------------------------------

others
mako jinja genshi all offer a more flexible alternative to django templates


cryptlib	gnutls---------------------------------------------------

others
openssl is more similar to peter gutmann s cryptlib and gnu s gnutls


reportlab	pdfrw---------------------------------------------------

others
you can use a similar but perhaps slightly better path with pdfrw -- you can run pdfrw in conjunction with reportlab and import the pdf you exported from pydot and use it as a form xobject similar to an image on the reportlab canvas


melt	reshape---------------------------------------------------

others
in response to your comment i believe cast and melt from the reshape package are much simpler for your purpose

here it is with reshape in base though joran is right melt is likely easier


xna	spritebatch---------------------------------------------------

others
in xna when is it appropriate to render your game content using more than one spritebatch


telerik	radwindow---------------------------------------------------

others
telerik has a control called radwindow which is more or less a modal window


eigen	ublas---------------------------------------------------

others
from my own experience mtl4 is much faster than ublas and it is also faster than eigen


octree	quadtree---------------------------------------------------

others
quadtree is better for big open spaces and octree is better for in-door spaces with many levels


coalesce	isnull---------------------------------------------------

efficient query plans
to prefer isnull over coalesce when given the choice is that isnull tends to produce query plans that are more efficient than coalesce

i saw a coalesce statement version but isnull is more efficient


alternative standard
you could also use isnull but coalesce is more standard

coalesce is the more standard alternative of isnull


values first null
you can also use isnull but coalesce allow more that two values you can use it for three or more columns like coalesce column1 column2 column3

i tend to use coalesce only when i need to get the first non-null value from a set of 3 or more values as isnull only supports two parameters

i understand the difference between these functions but my question is when checking for a single null value would isnull be any quicker than using coalesce

coalesce will go through the listed values and choose the first one that isn t null it s more portable code than isnull or ivnl etc


others
i ve been told that coalesce is less costly than isnull but research doesn t indicate that

coalesce is more correct of course you could just embed isnull over and over and over... but put that under a performance microscope and coalesce may just win

coalesce is more cross-compatible than isnull or nvl it works on mssql oracle mysql derby et al.

coalesce case can add implicit data type conversions whereas isnull has simpler rules

the function isnull is kind of equivalent but coalesce allows more arguments and is standard sql.

sql server is probably smart enough to translate isnull into the equivalent sarg expression but if you are bent on using a function then coalesce is a better choice because it is part of the sql standard allows for multiple values instead of just two with isnull and avoids using quite possibly the most confusing function name microsoft ever devised in isnull

for anyone curious about the coalesce vs isnull discussion and why i changed my answer to use isnull kanav rightly pointed out that coalesce is more expensive

using coalesce is better option than isnull or case..when for this problem since the input values for the coalesce expression can be evaluated multiple times

- coalesce should be more portable than isnull

in this case i would use coalesce which provides more levels than isnull rather than the case stement

you can also use coalesce which is the more general form of isnull and is actually part of the sql standard


better faster ansi
an example of why coalesce is better than isnull

note that in this case the isnull would do the same as coalesce but looks better for this application in case you add some new language

isnull is better then coalesce because of how datatypes are handled

isnull is faster than coalesce

this is pretty much the ifloop answer but isnull is slightly faster than coalesce

in most cases it has reviled indexes that needed to be add and in most cases the indexes improved the queries the most but after thet have been added the isnull and dynamic still perform better than the coalesce

on the subject of performance on sql server isnull often performs better than coalesce but the latter is ansi compliant if that is important to you

you can use isnull also in place of coalesce as isnull is comparatively faster than coalesce

coalesce is the standard ansi way isnull gives slightly better performance although the difference is probably insignificant in most cases

isnull will be faster i think because it has lesser function code implementation for itself making it faster than coalesce

isnull performs better than the generic coalesce and better than having another and

isnull can only have one input however it s been shown to be slightly faster than coalesce

isnull is marginally faster than coalesce

is the performance of coalesce field constant better than isnull

you will find that coalesce works better than isnull here

i would see if i got better results with isnull instead of coalesce

in some circumstances isnull is faster than case or coalesce

but depending on the answers to those questions i m guessing that coalesce might do the trick for you better than isnull

edit based on the tests done by multiple people and by theory isnull seems to be a better option over coalesce

note that i much much much prefer the ansi standard coalesce but sql server has done us the favor of documenting why isnull is better effort that imho could have been spent fixing the problem


charindex	substr---------------------------------------------------

others
links to substr nullif charindex functions was given earlier by respected pà à à à ªà


jena	rdflib---------------------------------------------------

others
since you tagged this with python you might find rdflib more useful than jena but the real question here should be about how to do the conversion not the library request since library requests are off topic for stack overflow


primefaces	richfaces---------------------------------------------------

others
primefaces has more components but lack combobox available in richfaces

one that always trips me up is that core uses render primefaces uses update and earlier versions of richfaces used rerender as the attribute to specify which other elements were the target of the ajax response

i haven t tried any of these in a jsf 2 application but i would recommend using the primefaces one at least the documentation is better than richfaces

richfaces is more developed and tested generally since primefaces came out later than rf


sqldatasource	objectdatasource---------------------------------------------------

others
objectdatasource also allows for more efficient paging than a simple sqldatasource i m assuming that s what you re using


notepad++	sublimetext---------------------------------------------------

others
notepad++ which is often recommended are even more broken than sublimetext 2 which i find to be pretty good actually

i prefer sublimetext because it s a little more customizable than notepad++ but they re both great options and lighter than dreamweaver

i prefer sublimetext 2 but notepad++ or scite might suit you better


submit	submission---------------------------------------------------

yes click am
you should treat submit as what happens after you ve done any pre-processing so binding to click events then conditionally raising the submit is better than always submission but conditionally stopping the submit

i think it can be better to do form submission through javascript so on submit function can be controlled more wisely to kill popup on more than one submit click....am i right if yes plz guide this way


others
if a user submit it once and the request is made i don t want them to keep submission it making more requests otherwise that ll bog down the site

i am wondering if i can submit the paramaters to via ajax show a loader image after submission it but once the file is complete return the file for download

so i have a form that submit to a database and i want to prevent more than one submission if the user clicks the submit button more than once...with a little research this seems easily enough done however none of the solutions i found worked for me as i am using the jquery validationengine plugin to validate the form client side


form button server
also note that for form submission it is typically better to use the onsubmit event as opposed to the onclick event since forms can technically be submitted by hitting the enter key as well as clicking the submit button

the captcha is generated on load and it s checked by another server script which you can call on clicking the submit button but before actually submission explore more events of form submission

in that case binding to the form submit may be better to prevent other means of submission the form which cricumvent the button click

i suspect this will submit the right form data but may not be acceptable if your button is calling js and is doing more than submission form data


fgets	fread---------------------------------------------------

others
also as others have stated while i took too long to answer fread may be a better alternative since fgets won t necessarily read 10 chars


subclass	abstract-class---------------------------------------------------

interfaces minimal interface
write the application differently - create a matching interface and write the service provider implementation against it testing that and also write a minimal subclass of the abstract-class that does nothing more than forward calls to the interface

but unless you re using such excellent testing practices and patterns i d be suspicious of abstractions that have a single concrete example -- interfaces with just one implementation no less than abstract-class with just one concrete subclass


others
i ended up defining an static string in each subclass holding the tag of the element so i decided to turn the interface into an abstract-class and give it more functionality

making abstract-class before i had more than one subclass in mind for them

image is an abstract-class so i think the real question is which subclass is more efficient for your program


zen-cart	magento---------------------------------------------------

others
alternatively zen-cart looks simpler than magento but without some of the flexibility


rcurl	httr---------------------------------------------------

requests wrapper kinds
the new package httr provides a wrapper around rcurl to make it easier to scrape all kinds of pages

the httr package is a bit nicer than rcurl for making http requests in my opinion and it sets a user-agent string by default


others
besides parallelization i also read that httr might be a better alternative to rcurl


operands	scalar---------------------------------------------------

others
the draft c++11 standard tells us that unless stated otherwise the order of evaluations of operands are unsequenced and if the same scalar object is modified more that once by unseqeucend side effects than we have undefined behavior

vector instructions may use array operands that require a higher alignment than any scalar


bower	npm---------------------------------------------------

others
what i meant to ask is it can be argued that npm has a wider user base than bower some even argue that we should stop using bower altogether like here and here

bower is more focused on browser libraries and css while npm is more for server-sided stuff using node.js

i ve been using bower info package and npm view package to see which package manager has more versions of numerous packages and have found that bower goes much farther back to older versions of the packages

perhaps write a config file for them bower.json for bower and package.json for npm that makes things cleaner and you can ensure installation by running npm install

bower is more similar to npm than to component

is bower a better fit than npm for asp .net 5 projects with separation of source and build files and if not what s the recommended way of doing it purely with npm

bower packages are simpler than npm equivalents and don t have subfolders with module dependencies

on the project i m using bower to manage dependencies because i found that it has way more available versions than npm does

after trying npm install one more time with the same result i tried bower install

even if you can handle them with npm it s better to use bower since it s optimized for this purpose no deep dependencies among other things


bit sense harder
using npm package is a little bit harder than using bower package

my codebase is front-end only so after doing a little reading i thought bower would make more sense than npm


bash	tcsh---------------------------------------------------

others
i used to write csh scripts myself but i ve found that sh and bash are much better for programming though tcsh still has a few advantages for interactive use.

i want to do this in tcsh i know bash is better to use but i have to use tcsh

csh and tcsh aliases are more powerful but csh lacks functions -- and you re using bash anyway.


nginx	lighttpd---------------------------------------------------

others
i actually found the setup of nginx much easier than lighttpd not to mention that you can install a macport of nginx port install nginx +ssl that does not contain the ssl-breaking bug that lighttpd suffers from here

i was also going to recommend nginx + fastcgi as i prefer nginx to lighttpd it s better mantained or at least that s been my perception the last few years

using a different server such as one apache and one nginx or one apache and one lighttpd will be much easier because their configuration files don t conflict with each other

letâ s encrypt provides great scripts for apache 2 and nginx but not lighttpd which is much more comfortable for small systems like raspberry pi or old boxes

according to this benchmark nginx is a little bit better than lighttpd for serving bigger static contents so nginx would be a good choice for static flv video contents

you could do something like configure a reverse proxy for certain paths in lighttpd to go to a different port which nginx owns but this will still push all the data through lighttpd and just use more resources than having lighttpd serve it directly

nginx seems to be the webserver getting the majority of the buzz lately it may be able to serve faster than lighttpd maybe not

it s simple and nginx is even more ridiculously fast and lightweight than lighttpd

shortly put running some benchmarks on a page doing some database operations and serving static dynamic content has shown that plain cherrypy was twice as fast than nginx and memcached and about half faster than lighttpd


feof	fread---------------------------------------------------

others
if fread returns 0 check feof and ferror to find out if you got to the end-of-file or got an error both cause fread to return less than the number requested


screens	tablet---------------------------------------------------

others
the issue is that the phone screens height in landscape mode is likely much less than a tablet or pc

is there a reason why getting a location from a pc screens could be more accurate than the corresponding operation on a tablet or phone

using px as a measurement would actually be worse - as new tablet have high dpi screens meaning 100px is going to be visually smaller on a tablet than it would on a mid spec phone

they are for example too big in a phone and too small in a tableth because the screens of tablet has more centimeter than the pone screens

i know that when it does the whole configuration settings are representing a much smaller screens than the tablet s screens but how can i tell if this is a regular phone device with a small screens or a tablet running compatibility zoom mode

in my actual code i ve set the display to none if the screens width is larger than tablet size because that s the only time i feel like i need the button

there is more than one screens size in android and what fits on a qvga 2.8 screens and what fits on a 10 tablet will not be the same

tablet have more screens space

in practice this would be a tablet sized screens bigger than 320px wide when it is in portrait

suppose you were to choose a new tablet and you wanted it to have 1 a big screens and 2 a screens that is bigger than 20cm

the content is longer than the screens of my tablet so i need to scroll vertically on a card

i would like to make my app available only on phones i.e devices whose screens sizes are less than 5.5 inch.how do i limit my app from being visible on tablet on play store

a lower dpi makes things smaller and allows this tablet to show more stuff on the screens at once

in fact when a tablet has a larger than standard screens size the tablet with detachable keyboards available these days mobile versions of the site can look over-optimised for space which is the reason why browsers allow tablet users to opt to display sites in desktop mode

it s like the measurements aren t the same and even if i use align client the twebbrowser won t fill the screens of the 7 tablet which is more or less the a4 aspect ratio

any devices 600dp and larger tablet have a larger copy of the image to take advantage of the larger screens real estate while all other phones use a smaller copy located in the bin with no screens width qualifier

the first time i run this on a device i realized that i was on a wrong track for some of the local phablets tablet mobile that have large screens has less screens density

this tablet has a bigger screens yet is still showing only 2 child views in the row

owing to the fact that the screens density on the tablet is smaller android therefore uses the images in the mdpi folder for the tablet and the slightly bigger ones in the hdpi folder for the phone

a tablet offers more screens space than a phone

as an example my android tablet s stock video player app has a feature that allows it to be less than full screens

here in your example col-md-4 class is been used that means if you will shrink your screens more than medium screens size ipad or tablet it will starts responsiveness

tablet mean that the default is that the screens is wider than it is tall.

you will see that mostly the avds with the bigger screens are way slower tablet are unusable on my machine hvga is almost like a real device

if the width of the screens is higher than 768px use the landscape layout split the screens into 2 applicable in landscape mode for phones and tablet


larger program handset
the screens is much smaller so you can not present your app the same way as you can on a tablet

i beleive tablet have greater screens resolutions than smartphones

not all tablet will have a larger screens after all

the tablet s screens must be larger than the phone s screens

because a tablet s screens is much larger than that of a

on tablet the screens size is much bigger and there is enough space for most of the action items that s why your menu is placed on top

correct me if im wrong but i think the apk for mobile can be used to install the app in tablet.your problem would be in the ui coz mobile has smaller screens than tablet

because a tablet s screens is much larger than that of a handset there s more room to combine and interchange ui components

but tablet program screens will be bigger right

however i also need to support tablet which have wider screens


pop-up computer website
this only happens when the window is on a computer in full screens mode but when the screens is made smaller to a phone tablet size the divs function how they should

i ve come across this website and when you scale the page down to tablet size the logo which is ethan marcotte is in perfect ratio when the screens size gets bigger and smaller

since the screens of an ipad or other tablet is bigger than a phone s display and that would leave me with a bunch of open space i was wondering if there is something in codename one to have an image pop-up on a tablet but that it is not visible on a phone s display


pixels resolution higher
this is because that tablet often has a lower density of screens pixels

i know that obviously a tablet has a higher screens resolution than a phone because it has more pixels dots on the screens from what ive been reading tablet also have a higher dpi dots per inch than phones as well

the tablet had a higher resolution 1920 x 1080 pixels - found by checking the screens resolution through a right click on the desktop than the machine i had initially run the program on 1366 x 768 pixels

incidentally many smartphones and tablet do have higher dpi screens

a bitmap of a screenshot can get really big on a tablet since the screens resolution is likely higher

screens resolution i.e higher than tablet i.e col-md and col-lg in bootstrap language should only cover 11 grid with offset of 1


different data sizes
in the long run you ll have less troubles with supporting tablet multiple screens sizes and you can easily re-use them in different contexts

desktops when in full screens have a more detailed data entry experience whereas mobile tablet have a different experience because of device real estate is smaller

you do not have to provide different layouts for different screens sizes however the possibility of say a tablet displaying more data over a phone is there - so you may want to give the user more options or show the navigation constantly


res reasonable ones
just be aware that screens size categories like xlarge for example aren t tied to a hard number like 10 inches. instead official documentation uses terms like an xlarge screens is defined as a screens that is significantly larger than a large screens such as a tablet or something larger ...

having different ones based upon screens size is reasonable bigger margins on tablet though the mix then would be something like res values dimens.xml and res values-sw720dp values.xml


resolution phones higher
i can t use screens size because of devices like galaxy note with huge screens and some phones have higher resolution than some tablet same with dpi i think

basically my layout has 1200px grid width but i figured that there will be a problem with 1024px screens resolution 20 of the population bla bla so i created media queries when the screens size is smaller than 1199px the grid to change its width to 960px and so on for tablet phones etc..

by contrast a nexus 7 tablet has higher actual screens resolution than an ipad mini but it reports to your web page a smaller screens size


room available space
it simply comes down to the space available a tablet gives more room to developers thus allowing developers to put more on one screens

if my app runs on tablet i put more fragments on the screens as there s room for this and i got just one activity in which i replace fragments when needed

you will also notice that the fonts are not scaling as the 7 tablet simply has more screens space available vs the 4 phone


use diagonal criteria
to determine device is tablet or mobile i use criteria if device s screens diagonal is greater than 7 iches the device is tablet

an xlarge screens is defined as a screens that is significantly larger than a large screens such as a tablet or something larger and may require special care on the application s part to make good use of it though it may rely on resizing by the system to fill the screens


width smaller desktop
to ensure all tablet excluding any larger screens phone will use the new layout how should i name my layout folder

youll want to choose which screens dimensions you consider as mobile might be hard as some tablet are barely bigger than some smartphone.

the desktop tablet version is working fine its when the screens gets smaller and the smartphone version loads the image doesn t work as it should

splitactionbar works only on phones because the screens size is much smaller than tablet and it takes space at the bottom for extra space for your action items

however the number of people using these giant tablet is much smaller than the number of people with small screens laptops

i m trying use a grid layout but my problem is the layout showing bigger than my screens on the 240dpi tablet 1 5 times bigger

on a tablet or phone which may have less than 750px screens width it will go off the viewport

i have been working on this page that works fine in desktop devices and tablet but not on phones because the width of the page is more than the screens width i need to make this width responsive to have the page with height-only scroll

when viewed on a screens wider than a tablet to be responsive according to the smaller screens size like this

what i would like to do is use css media queries to have the title be above the tabs when the screens gets smaller or on a tablet or iphone

if the app is running on a tablet or in a landscape view where the screens is larger than certain width i d like the listviews to have the data-inset property set to true and be rendered with rounded corners and borders

for example when the screens size becomes smaller to a tablet or mobile you could do this as an example

it s hard to explain but just imagine that i move this layout to 300px x then on the phone it works because the screens isn t that large but on tablet it will probably not work because the screens is larger

my aim is to use a bootstrap 3 dropdown to display links at mobile screens size and use a list to display the same links when the screens is bigger desktop and tablet size

if i try to distinguish based on resolutions it wouldn t work right since some high end smartphones have smaller screens but higher screens resolutions while some tablet have bigger screens but smaller resolutions

inside the container i have a panel with the text set to left but when the screens gets smaller then a tablet to something like a phone i want the text in the panel to center

another layout for larger devices like tablet where the screens width is larger than your image

the reason those two really high resolutions exist in mdpi is because they are only used on tablet which have a larger screens size...so the dpi rating works out to still be in the midrange

this will only be added if the screens width is smaller than 480px else the tablet version would show the mobile version

it is quite possible that those large devices tablet have much larger screens width and height than a typical phone

twitter desktop accomodates screensizes from around 1048px wide when you are on a screens that is smaller then that you are probably on a tablet or smartphone and if you open twitter from a browser on your phone you are instantly redirected to and prompted to download the twitter app

you could make your css mobile-first meaning that all properties are optimized for mobile then as the screens gets wider you apply tablet and desktop optimized css for elements

in portrait mode your phone screens is smaller than that so screen_is_narrow is true whereas in landscape mode and on tablet it is wider and thus screen_is_narrow becomes false

in mobile platforms except larger screens as on tablet the affix would be disabled entirely and the page would only rely on the responsiveness of the grid

on a tablet i don t have this issue because the screens size is bigger and i make videoview always on screens

this way you get if the screens height or width is greater than 960px and the dpi is low probably you re on a tablet

also a tablet might be more suited since it runs apps in tablet layout mode versus a phone layout with everything being too large on a bigger screens

like most screens being no smaller than 320px width most mobile sizes in the 320â 640px range tablet usually around 960px


backtracking	greedy---------------------------------------------------

others
the capturing group 1 in the first pattern is greedy it first matches everything and takes as less as it backtracking

but this is not a good regex because matches zero or more times with greedy for every search it will go to the end then it will backtracking to match the

since the next is not far the number of backtracking steps is much fewer than with greedy matching

for your code to work spirit would need to recognize that the greedy print_p matched too much and then backtracking to allow matching less


factors	matrix---------------------------------------------------

x x.getrow size
however it still performs worse by initially a factors of 3 but as the matrix size increases asymptotically worse by a factors of exactly 2

however that is much worse by a factors of 10000 than what i am currently doing which is for matrix x for putting and x.getrow idx .todense for taking


others
consider a model with lots of factors or nonlinear terms like bs ns or poly the model frame is much smaller compared with model matrix

finally note that by default ichol references the lower triangle of the input matrix and returns a lower triangular factors

after that you can use acp on sub matrix to extract factors and understand more the composition of each cluster

perhaps in the same vein and i had a problem of this sort with some of my other data trying to convert character names in matrix and data frames into factors results in more confusing behaviour

which matrix will be better in defining the correlation between the factors

matrix factorization sometimes referred to as matrix decomposition is a general term in ml there are many ways to approximate a matrix using simpler factors sometimes with loss of info

i measured the time it takes to calculate the distance between a vector and the rows of a matrix when they are in the object and it work slower by a factors of 3 then the normal distance function

in the code below i use block multiplication to speed up your code for a 1024x1204 matrix by more than a factors of ten 7.1 s with old code and 0.6s with new using only a single thread without using sse avx

eta to answer your question in more general terms let s say we had the number of subjects and levels set up in advance increasing the number of factors is more complicated unless i m mistaken because then it would no longer be a two-dimensional matrix


centos	mint---------------------------------------------------

others
my suggestion is to reason if mint is the right distribution for a lamp stack or if other distributions centos fit better


strsplit	substr---------------------------------------------------

others
joe duffy s blog implies using substr is more efficient than strsplit

usually you use strsplit to break a string in parts but with substr there s an easier solution for your problem


mutators	setter---------------------------------------------------

others
these methods which give us access to private members are known as getter setter or better knows as accessor mutators


thin	webrick---------------------------------------------------

others
i also found that installing thin as your rails web server c gem install thin will perform much faster than the default webrick server

my personal experience is that webrick is faster in my development environment than unicorn and thin os x in a pretty big rails app lots of gems routes etc

i was getting 0.5 reqs s on the front page of my rails app a very simple mostly static page that made a couple of database calls but nothing that webrick said took longer than 0.8 ms served with thin

3 use thin instead of webrick - thin seems easier to configure for ssl


slower performance better
in production it is much better to use a more sophisticated server like phusion passenger or unicorn since they have better performance than thin mongrel or webrick

from my experience webrick is slower than mongrel is slower than thin


web2py	cherrypy---------------------------------------------------

others
frameworks like flask cherrypy pyramid or even web2py might be the easier ones to start with


sublimetext	scite---------------------------------------------------

others
i prefer sublimetext 2 but notepad++ or scite might suit you better

sublimetext 3 needs much more time several seconds more then scite before the opened file shows up and i suppose it is because sublimetext does some pre-evaluation of the file content like detecting areas suitable for folding there are fold triangles available depending on indentation of non-white characters in the file


uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller---------------------------------------------------

others
basically if the user is on a view under the more tab the actual current uinavigationcontroller you want to use to push a uiviewcontroller onto is the uitabbarcontroller s morenavigationcontroller property

i m trying to push a view controller from a tableview displayed inside a uiviewcontroller that is included in a uitabbarcontroller it s more simple that it looks...

when you add more than 5 uiviewcontroller objects to your uitabbarcontroller ios will automatically create the more button for you


fgets	strlen---------------------------------------------------

others
read the number in a char array a with scanf s a or better with fgets and output the char array reversed by outputting each character starting from strlen a - 1 to 0

the fgets function accepts the input when a newline character enter key when using stdin is encountered and the newline character n is considered a valid character by the function and included in the string copied to your str2 .hence when you pass it as a parameter to strlen it gives one more than the original number of characters in your string to account for the additional n character


delphi	oxygene---------------------------------------------------

others
right now oxygene is much better as it supports a broader set of language and platform features than delphi .net ever did


irc	xmpp---------------------------------------------------

others
regardless the irc protocol is more simplistic in nature can handle orders of magnitude more client connections than xmpp for the same memory utilization uses less bandwidth on the wire doesn t require authentication although you can add this feature etc


mergesort	in-place---------------------------------------------------

others
parallelizing mergesort is simpler than quicksort in-place

mergesort is more difficult to implement in-place but the out-of-place version is very cache-friendly - i suspect real-world implementations accept the o n space overhead - ram is cheap but memory bandwidth is a major bottleneck so trading memory for cache-efficiency and speed is often a good deal


memory space standard
1 in-place merge sort is used when you want to sort a list in o nlogn time while using less space than standard mergesort

another reason is that mergesort needs more memory because it s hard to implement it as an in-place sort


picasso	fresco---------------------------------------------------

others
see picasso v s imageloader v s fresco vs glide for more guidance

use picasso glide or fresco to load images inside those cards picasso and glide are easier to use compared to fresco but fresco is better with memory


git-svn	svn2git---------------------------------------------------

tools use-case one-time
it is great if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for a one-time conversion you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case

it is a great tool if you want to use git as a frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case

it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case and should not suffer from oom error

it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn or tools based on it but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case

it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case and also makes proper git tags from the svn tags

it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but the right svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case


others
even though git-svn or the svn2git you used is easier to start with here are some further reasons why using the kde svn2git instead of git-svn is superior besides its flexibility

using svn2git might produce better results than git-svn if you have tags or branches.

would svn2git be better that git-svn for this scenario


nirvdrum worse superior
even though git-svn or the nirvdrum svn2git is easier to start with here are some further reasons why using the kde svn2git instead of git-svn is superior besides its flexibility

there are many reasons why git-svn is worse and the kde svn2git is superior

even though git-svn is easier to start with here are some further reasons why using the kde svn2git instead of git-svn is superior besides its flexibility

you see there are many reasons why git-svn is worse and the kde svn2git is superior


opencv	vlfeat---------------------------------------------------

others
have a look at sift and surf and at vlfeat which has a good sift implementation and also implements mser and hog and is much smaller than opencv


qt-creator	clion---------------------------------------------------

others
another alternative that people might mention is clion which is from jetbrains but its closed-source not well supported and whilst it might look nicer than qt-creator it has more or less the same features but is much more resource-heavy and laggy so i d pass on that


onmouseover	onclick---------------------------------------------------

others
i would like to combine hover onmouseover with onclick


cefsharp	cefglue---------------------------------------------------

others
however integrating cefglue into your winforms or wpf app may be more difficult than cefsharp


chart.js	morris.js---------------------------------------------------

others
after some investigation to try and get morris.js to do the animation this was found to be extremely difficult so i opted to go for making chart.js appear more like morris.js


countif	sumifs---------------------------------------------------

others
it doesn t sound as if you need anything more elaborate than a countif function and a sumifs function

you could also use sumifs with countif it s a more basic formula not as powerful as filter but just as funcitonal

bear in mind that index is the same as vlookup in that it will only return the first value if two tenders finished on the same day it will only return the first it comes across if you have more than one maybe sumifs would work better maybe along side countif to show how many there were

i really need countif to work more like sumifs


tensorflow	bazel---------------------------------------------------

others
from tensorflow official github how to construct a new dataset for retraining use official python script build_image_data.py directly and bazel is a better idea


explode	fgetcsv---------------------------------------------------

others
you will probably find that php s built-in fgetcsv will be easier and more accurate than a manual explode based strategy


subtraction	add---------------------------------------------------

others
addition and subtraction is worse as these have to be done in sequence of two operations and the second operation requires the first to have completed - this is not the case if the compiler is just producing two add operations on independent data

since addition can be faster then subtraction we add the offset instead of subtract it from 31

and my question is this if the book says that the addition and subtraction have lower priority compared to other operators what if i add the value of a typical expression multiplied

addition subtraction assignment has lower procedure than simply add operation


qlist	qvector---------------------------------------------------

easy words efficient
give better performance than qlist because qvector always

most often qvector is not the best container to use usually qlist is much better

which brings me to the point - if transaction ids are per savings account they would be sequential in other words you will be better off with the qlist or even better a qvector because it will be a little more efficient since you will only be appending transactions

size qlist performs better than qvector because it doesn t store the

if the size of the qlist s element type is greater than the pointer s size qlist performs better than qvector because it doesn t store the objects sequentially but stores sequentially pointers to heap copies

qvector is better than qlist in this case because it s easy to resize it


memory heap stores
operations like prepend and insert are usually faster than with qvector because of the way qlist stores its items in memory see algorithmic complexity for details and its index-based api is more convenient than qlinkedlist s iterator-based api

qvector will usually give better performance than qlist because qvector always stores its items sequentially in memory where qlist will allocate its items on the heap unless sizeof t sizeof void and t has been declared to be either a q_movable_type or a q_primitive_type using q_declare_typeinfo

if it stores it as pointers on the heap won t qlist be much worse off than qvector


others
qlist code is generally less optimized than qvector one


monomac	xamarin.mac---------------------------------------------------

others
so if initially xamarin.mac was more of a tool chain based on monomac from then on it became a completely different beast with new powers to conquer more challenges


google-api-python-client	oauth2client---------------------------------------------------

others
based on the output in this example one conflict is that datalab currently has oauth2client version 1.4.12 installed and the google-api-python-client library requires a version of oauth2client that is greater than or equal to 2.0.0

there s a known bug that when you install the googleads library using pip it will install a newer version of the oauth2client library which will break my google analytics api scripts because the google-api-python-client uses an older version of oauth2client


canopy	ptvs---------------------------------------------------

others
the upcoming canopy 1.2 release in a couple of weeks will include more complete integration with ptvs and visual studio that will automate this and remove the need for canopy to be the default python environment


pyodbc	adodbapi---------------------------------------------------

others
i am not sure but by reading the documentation i think you need to download the pyodbc it seems to be better supported than adodbapi


subtract	add---------------------------------------------------

oodles remainder
if the remainder is less than 3 subtract the remainder else add 5 - remainder

division is much harder to calculate with subtractions can t go too far find remainder - if a float then calculate fraction from remainder which in itself is oodles of add multiplying and subtract


greater int value
then while the temp value is greater than 99 subtract 100 from it and add 1 to the counter

provided a string i want to convert the chars from the string to an int add a value from another method getkey to this number and if the result is greater than 26 subtract 26

if you continue to use your method of performing this task then you need to manually check if the addition of the two lower order decimal digits has caused a carry by checking if the result of the addition is greater than 10 and if it is subtract 10 from the number and then add 1 to the higher order digit calculation

while the number is greater than stacksize add a stacksize to the stack and subtract that from the number

then while the temp value is greater than 9 subtract 10 from it and add 1 to the counter

look at it this way based on your logic while x is greater than 100 add 5 while it s greater than 500 subtract 5 .

just take the difference and if it s negative add 2pi and then if it s greater than 2pi subtract 2pi


others
quick idea - go through the roman number from right to left if value of more to the left is smaller than then subtract it from the result if larger then add it

to find all the pairs of integers x and y that sum to n when cubed set x to the largest integer less than the cube root of n set y to 0 then repeatedly add 1 to y if the sum of the cubes is less than n subtract 1 from x if the sum of the cubes is greater than n and output the pair otherwise stopping when x and y cross

i need some help though i need each number in that list to be subtract from 27 then if the result is less than 33 add 94 then print the numbers as they were just with that sum completed how do i do this

we observe that for 7 nodes 1 2 3 5 6 8 9 we are getting further by 1 add 7 9-2 to the score for other 2 4 7 we are getting closer by 1 subtract 2

if the price is less than 25 add 10 to that price if the price is 25 or over i want to subtract 10 from that price

to make the value gotten from the above steps to a hexadecimal digit in character form then for values lower than 10 add 0 if you re on a computer with with ascii encoding and for values at 10 or higher then subtract ten and add a

i know this is a simple example but for more complex code if sub add and sub subtract had more code would it make sense to group in subroutines

since addition can be faster then subtraction we add the offset instead of subtract it from 31

if there is more than that subtract 250 + 180 and add 6 h to the time needed


getelementsbytagname	htmlcollection---------------------------------------------------

others
since an id is unique and the methods getelementsbytagename or getelementsbytagname returns a live htmlcollection it s better if you use these elements as unique variables so you won t ask your browser to fetch them many times


arp	tcp---------------------------------------------------

others
it would appear from your question that the period of the tcp message is shorter than the arp refresh time

if you are using linux check out netdiscover this uses arp i think arp is lower level than tcp udp and with java you can only create apps from tcp udp and above


bionic	libc---------------------------------------------------

others
bionic the android version of libc is more slightly more limited not by much

unless you particularly need to build against a more standard libc than bionic you can just use the ndk s toolchain either by copying the hello-jni example and changing build_shared_library to build_executable in the jni android.mk or using the script to generate a stand alone toolchain


nhibernate	queryover---------------------------------------------------

others
right now queryover is much more robust in the nhibernate community mainly because it is based on criteria queries which have been around for quite some time


prepare	execute---------------------------------------------------

tokens values greater
i ve updated the answer to use bind variables so that using prepare will give you more security and then you can either bind the values or using pdo execute with the array of bind values

is there a way to allow the number of parameters passed thru pdo execute to be greater than the number of tokens identified in the prepare statement


others
prepare queries are more efficient when you execute a query multiple times and also obviate the need to sanitize user input

prepare statements offer for free a more reliable and secure dynamic parameter binding which is what you want and also better performances especially with recurring queries because prepare statements are pre- compiled by the database engine and much more efficient to execute

this is adequate but as mentioned - prepare and - execute handling are better

so the solution you have come up with is correct if you want to mess with the statement text between invocation then by all means use client-side text manipulations 1 but do not attempt to use the result of it as a prepare statement unless you really intend to execute the resulting text more than once

searching around shows many people bench marking prepare as being much slower and more intensive than the using execute especially when you aren t expecting any values back also see the doc for prepare - it notes being designed to optimize calling the same query multiple times


execution better quicker
prepare statements are sent to the database which checks it for errors and also optimizes it so that consecutive calls to the execute method are performed faster

using a solution such as a prepare statement where it is not possible for a user to directly influence the actual sql query being execute is a safer alternative

2 executemany is better than execute as it makes for you the prepare statement

yes if one sql statement is execute repeatedly using prepare statements is much better

performance occasionally - it is true that prepare statements are vastly quicker when execute many times but in practice this is very infrequent

prepare statements are much faster if you execute the same sql and just change parameters in it

any execute statement becomes prepare sooner or later it need to be parsed optimized compiled and then execute

prepare execution is faster than direct execution for statements execute more than three or four times because the statement is compiled only once while statements execute directly are compiled each time they are execute

this would be so much handy to be able to send execute statement in one shot as the prepare query are way better in term of security if i go with the query method i will have to escape manually my parameters...

if i didn t get it wrong prepare statements are faster because they are sent only the first time to the rdbms and then only the parameters are sent when it needs to be execute

my question is how can i execute more than 1 prepare statement

prepare statements are faster to execute if used repeatedly

prepare statements are slightly faster when execute repeatedly because the mysql server has to parse the sql and run the query planner optimizer only once


pyopengl	pyglet---------------------------------------------------

others
pyglet is more strict the pyopengl so i m now learning it

i d say that pyglet is actually more evolved than pyopengl


onkeyup	onblur---------------------------------------------------

others
also onchange won t work you ll need to use onkeyup although onblur is probably more sane


retaincount	dealloc---------------------------------------------------

others
if your array s retaincount is greater than 1 at the start of dealloc some other object is retaining it at least temporarily


lsp	principles---------------------------------------------------

others
you didn t misunderstand lsp allowing a bigger type in a subclassed method doesn t violate the principles

the ol principles open closed and lsp are more oriented towards languages based upon inheritance as a core software engineering concept


satellite	altitude---------------------------------------------------

others
vertical position altitude needs one more satellite in view at least 4 so is not always reliable if gps sees only 3 satelites

quote from the third link - the altitude error is much greater because it is a satellite based system


multiplying	modulo---------------------------------------------------

others
also integer multiplying is less expensive so you may just do the divide first and calculate the modulo 10

and depending on the architecture you re implementing this on it might be faster - the multiplying might take less time than the branch in the modulo or for hardware implementations might well take the same time

more generally you can always just try multiplying the base by itself a number of times no greater than the modulo and you are bound to find a cycle

is much harder than multiplying by 5 3 and 2 and taking the modulo in between each time

but my guess would be that in this particular chunk of code multiplying divide and modulo all take roughly the same amount of time and that time is greater than add or subtract

if you have the choice modulo is probably more convenient basically you take your matrix modulo a number m after each power or multiplying and the individual entries of the matrix will never grow beyond m - 1 2 but obviously the result will be an algorithm for modular exponentiation thus different from what you have now


subclass	accessor---------------------------------------------------

others
the indirection has some costs and is kinda ugly so if you want to keep this functionality you might be better off by implementing accessor methods and only log in a subclass of core


xls	.doc---------------------------------------------------

others
the last two doc and xls don t render in-line on the page it downloads the word .doc or .xls to the client computer


fseek	ftell---------------------------------------------------

others
it could be the fseek you read is greater than the current ftell which would indicate the file is smaller than it was but that would not cover all eventualities


navigationcontroller	pushviewcontroller---------------------------------------------------

others
if it s a navigationcontroller just call revealcontroller.frontviewcontroller pushviewcontroller animated


janusgraph	titan---------------------------------------------------

others
janusgraph is a more up-to-date version of titan despite the low version number


redhat	fedora---------------------------------------------------

others
last version on ibm s website is from 2008 redhat enterprise 5.2 and fedora 9 - has anyone an experience running this ibm sdk on fedora 13 or at least any version higher than stated fedora 9 and is linux available of sufficient testing

gnu gdb fedora 6.8-37.el5 or gnu gdb gdb redhat enterprise linux 7.0.1-37.el5

from experience redhat are somewhat slower to approve new versions of packages than some other distributions so you might want to switch to the redhat-esque fedora or the debian-esque ubuntu which tend to update to newer versions more quickly


cpython	ironpython---------------------------------------------------

c areas problems
it seems ironpython is just slower than cpython for reading text files

if there s any heavy application logic as opposed to all of the work being networking files database ironpython is much faster than cpython at a few things and much slower at a few others so you probably need to profile and perf-test before you go too far down either path

ironpython is faster than c# in certain areas but not faster than cpython however you can link ironpython to any language thus over coming problems but then again you can do the same with cpython

it s possible that jython and ironpython are much faster than cpython as well as they are backed by heavily optimized virtual machines jvm and .net clr

also on implementations like jython or ironpython could be a lot slower than with cpython


conclusion faster
consequently ironpython is potentially faster than cpython is especially for multithreading scenarios

i m not sure exactly how you re drawing the conclusion that ironpython is faster than cpython


others
ironpython and jython are also jit-compiled although using the more generic jvm and .net jits so they tend to be faster than cpython for this kind of work as well

ironpython should make it easier via .net approaches but cpython is not that far via com implementation in win32all

so if you want to use django or something like that it s probably not smart to use ironpython because it isn t really cross-platform doesn t work with some frameworks and it performs worse than cpython

for me ironpython has been the more robust choice and much of what i ve written in cpython ports without changes

one of the largest benefits of ironpython is that it has effectively no gil - meaning that if you are both writing python code and it is multi-threaded - you can often get performance that is better than cpython without having to spawn multiple process and pickle objects across the boundaries

my understanding was it was written in vanilla python cpython but if you are more comfortable with ironpython it shouldn t be hard to translate

cpython probably has better ide support at present than ironpython - so this may be a factor in the choosing of one over the other

i am however no cpython guru and can get so much more out of ironpython than cpython as i can easily leverage the .net platform on which i am far more at home


lxml	libxml2---------------------------------------------------

others
also since lxml is based on libxml2 and libxslt you ll need less calls into the c api which can be quite expensive in my experience

lxml uses libxml2 and provides a nicer interface the elementtree so you get most of the benefit of libxml2 s speed and all of the benefit of it s xpath evaluation

libxml2 libxslt also come with their own much lower-level python bindings but lxml is much more straightforward and pythonic and it seems to have great performance as well

the chapter starts with short course to xml general talk but with the atom syndication feed example then it continues with the standard xml.etree.elementtree and continues with third party lxml that implements more with the same interface full xpath 1.0 based on libxml2


tokudb	myisam---------------------------------------------------

others
from my personal use i experienced about 5 - 10 times less disk usage due to tokudb s compression and it s much much faster than myisam or innodb


matlab	simulink---------------------------------------------------

others
it s difficult to tell without seeing the simulink model but i suspect that in simulink you are using a variable-step solver which is able to take much smaller time steps than in your matlab file giving you more accurate results

for that purpose i want to transform the simulink model into a c version and launch it from a matlab script so that the process would be much faster than opening simulink environment


tablesorter	datatables---------------------------------------------------

others
one thing you could look into is using tablesorter - which is much simpler than datatables - with a drag and drop plugin like sortable for jquery ui or this


lisp	smalltalk---------------------------------------------------

others
common lisp is an image base language although usually to a lesser extent than smalltalk

smalltalk methods tend to be more fine-grained than lisp functions so that may be a good place to begin


maven	cobertura---------------------------------------------------

others

checking post easier
also forgot to mention junit testing framework and a great eclipse plugin eclemma for code coverage much better than cobertura ecobertura and easier to use and of course you can try maven as the other post mentionned or try ant as build tool

i find cobertura and emma to be largely interchangeable in terms of coverage checking just that cobertura has a better maven plugin and emma has a better eclipse plugin in my opinion

if you re going to stick with maven and want a plugin for maven that will do the code-coverage job i think cobertura is a better choice as emma stable last build is from 2005


opencart	magento---------------------------------------------------

others
magento is way ahead and has larger extensions than opencart

magento is much better if you can find a good magento developer to customize it for you but opencart is easier to use

i m working on my first magento site and things are a little bit different than for example opencart but just trying to learn new things i decided to go with magento and try harder however there s one thing that i git stuck and is this i m calling my shopping cart elements using this

i d have to say i d personally go for either prestashop or cscart as they do have a lot more features than opencart and at the same time also don t cost anywhere near magento to setup and run


arduino	avr-gcc---------------------------------------------------

others
opted to use arduino from command line because it suited my needs so far i know avrdude and avr-gcc is a more complete or better way to compile upload from command line correct me if i m wrong

edit my original answer made some assumptions that arduino ide was closer to avr-gcc than it actually was


g++	gcc---------------------------------------------------

better
g++ seems to work better than gcc in my experience

so using g++ is better than gcc


others
gcc -e and g++ -e break even earlier

unfortunately g++ packed the structs significantly looser than gcc which caused significant problems sharing objects between c and c++ code

if it matters i m actually concerned with c++ and g++ but i thought gcc would be more recognizable as a generic compiler

afaik it uses g++ to be more precise it uses gcc with language set to c++ and of course g++ for final linking

the g++ version is a little larger than the gcc version but not 100x larger

probably you ll need to set project type as c++ or set compiler name to g++ instead of gcc or add parameter -lstdc++ to command line eclipse uses for build

g++ compiler is more strict then gcc compiler

outside of calling the wrong compiler using gcc instead of g++ see answer by dan it is possible but unusual to have gcc correctly built but g++ incorrectly built


yslow	pagespeed---------------------------------------------------

others
in my testing so far google s pagespeed addon is far and above much better than yslow

i use firefox with firebug and yslow and think it s more reliable than pagespeed

imho pagespeed is better than yslow


apl	algol---------------------------------------------------

others
as far as the syntax goes i guess it s a bit different from the more classic syntax of the algol family languages but it s no more and possibly less weird than apl


moq	nmock---------------------------------------------------

others
this is another reason why i d prefer rhinomocks and moq over nmock nmock uses the older expectation style whereas rhinomocks and moq both support the arrange act assert approach where you specify you expected interactions as assertions at the end of the test like this


switching	screens---------------------------------------------------

others
after switching to windows 10 i ve noticed that when selecting a lower than normal screens resolution the panel fit mode will default to maintain aspect ratio meaning black bars appear

we can do a bit better if the virtual screens coords are higher resolution than our pixels which means we already get a sub-pixel position for the mouse cursor but the math won t change because we have still to switching to the gl s convent where integer means border instead of integer means center

how can i make my webpage switching buttons from on hover to on toggle when the width of the screens is less than 769px

i m looking to see if anyone has a workable solution so i can basically switching between this big banner and a smaller format for mobile browsers where the screens size is smaller and doesn t break my responsive site

but if i switching to my 24 monitor there is no longer this problem since the screens is wider and therefore the table rows are wider too

by pressing home screens then android might more likely kill your app process to reclaim its resources mostly memory - this is more probable if you switching to several other applications

however my mobile site has an option that allow user to switching to desktop view if there are not fond of the mobile site but how should i do that since the javascript in my homepage will block any screens that s smaller than 1024

for certain constellations switching from a 4-column to a three-column layout when screens size decreases more complex measure may be needed

i understand you are trying to load more events that are currently shown on screens so that they are cached and prev next switching works faster

i can switching between these two screens easily.at the beginning first screens is fully displayed.when i click a button second screens will come from right and first screens goes to the left.but i want to keep the second screens and remember..second screens has less width a portion of the first screen.that means a half of the first screens disappear

switching to 2.2 framework which has better compatability with screens resolutions and densities

- in my code sometimes i use px for imagens and sometimes dp but i ve tried switching all to dp in this screens and had even worse results

question is there a way i can switching these two col-md 6 s around when the screens is less that x pixels across

if you want to show more than 2 screens you might have to use a number and extend a handlebars function that can be use a switching statement to test for different values to show different content

i am developing application which requires many more than 80 screens layouts each layout having different image views buttons textviews and so on and i have to be able to switching between them upon button clicks

at this point there is nothing i can do since the switching is no longer there... the external screens is just a blank screens for the sake of the exercise

switching from the full nav-bar to the hamburger menu when the screens is less than 1200 px wide

how to make textures appears above each other as the shapes in color switching game when i touch screens there s one more shape is appear such as circles sticks and other shapes so how can i do that in libgdx

when the screens resizes the longer elements in my navbar switching to two lines to take up less space

a better word than screens is activity you switching between activities in android

when the switching gets bigger than a couple of screens full split it into functions that handle each state using a state table to look up the function directly

i am using flex to centre and position my element on my layers but when switching to a small screens size the element just get smaller while in bootstrap when i use when the screens get smaller the div take the whole width i wanna do something similar when the user switching to a small screens size i didnt use bootstrap because its realy hard to centre 3 div of in the middle of the page

the point of such an architecture is because i have news with some text between which i want to be able to switching with paging effect but the news text can be bigger than the screens


60px taller 90px
but then i noticed after changing a mobile to landscape it would switching back to the desktop mode due to the width of the media query being less than the screens landscape width

and then switching their display-properties when the screens is smaller than x px

content height is smaller than screens height is because of the virtual key back home switching app

if the sum of all the listview item s height is greater than the screens height you switching the layout type for one where you have a viewgroup relative layout with a listview without the footer on the top and a linearlayout at the bottom the desired footer

but when the screens is smaller than 900px we switching from fixed to liquid via media query switching to a liquid width will allow our images to scale down our text to wrap and a whole bunch of other great things

when the screens size is smaller i have it switching flex-direction to column which works well except i cannot figure out how to make the 2nd row trending down start where the trending up stops where ever that may be

i ve already built a view that can take a drawable can use focused pinch-zoom and drag can auto-scale images can switching images dynamically and takes images larger than the screens

the panels must be side by side for a large screens but they must be responsive and as the screens gets smaller and switching to vertical orientation

switching between landscape and portrait changes nothing the width is still larger than the screens

if the screens become smaller it switching to the next row but all the buttons are centered in the middel

i am using view flipper to show bunch on images like a slider where i implemented the functionality of swipe left and right to switching images now some of my images are larger than the screens size in terms of height are getting hidden

i ve got a responsive ad unit on my page and for some reason it has a height of 60px while i really need it to be 90px and switching to 300x250 when screens gets smaller

however when i switching to landscape mode the listview is taller than the screens


nsview	ikimagebrowserview---------------------------------------------------

others
while i haven t used nscollectionview myself my gut feeling is that there s probably going to be a greater overhead with numerous nsview s compared to ikimagebrowserview which uses the standard coupling of an nsview with an nscell -like reusable drawing mechanism to help improve performance


switching	airplane---------------------------------------------------

others
the whole thing just no longer working after i switching my iphone to airplane mode


expression-blend	silverlight---------------------------------------------------

others
ä tryed all the ways ä know but its not work i want image show pictures when ä click item of pathlistbox in silverlight here is my website you can see what ä am trying click to photogalley than left lower corner picture click on it than storyboard will show pictures ä want click on images of pathlistbox and bind it to image source than ä can see big picture here tutorial of create carosel pathlistbox but when i do lä ke they do sample data create in expression-blend xap getting bigger ä didnt create sample data ä load images from images folder in client bin folder here my website http forum.websayfaci.net

expression-blend has much more advanced wpf silverlight visual designer than visual studio including wysiwyg animation editor etc

silverlight will be quicker to develop - as animation data binding and charts via the silverlight toolkit are part of the platform - and there are mature tools for designing and developing it expression-blend and visual studio

i can see silverlight being utilised more in the coming years for a few reasons it is easier to deploy than activex it has excellent tool support vs2010 expression-blend and you can leverage your existing code base


division	subtract---------------------------------------------------

others
radix2 division shift and subtract would be much faster and easier to implement

if division result is larger than 1 push the current transformer to the results array and subtract the current wattage from the total wattage

however if the result a is added to or subtract from another expression and not reused then starting with the division may be more interesting since you can group the multiplication with the following addition by using a fma thus with a single rounding

division is performed by repeated subtraction therefore needs more level of subtract logic making division slower than addition

one way to check whether or not a double is a whole number without knowing the calculation type this works for more than just division would be to subtract the int part to get the fractions part and compare to zero

i d think the the multiplication division would give you more trouble but nevertheless in the long version you are still subtract two floating point numbers

version 2 is safer as it subtract remainders before division

division is much harder to calculate with subtractions can t go too far find remainder - if a float then calculate fraction from remainder which in itself is oodles of add multiplying and subtract


atoi	strtok---------------------------------------------------

others
for instance strtol is better than atoi and you should be checking each time whether strtok returns null


pandas	pytables---------------------------------------------------

others
pytables seems more flexible but i am unclear about what the most direct way of using it to save a full pandas dataframe with multiindex and all


equals	icomparable---------------------------------------------------

others
implementing icomparable is a more fine-grain way of comparison as it provides the compareto method which is a greater-than less-than comparison as opposed to equals which is simply a is-equal-or-not comparison

no - icomparable is for seeing if one object is greater than equals to or less than another


relationship method compareto
icomparable is an interface that defines that two instances of the implementing class can be seen as greater than less than or equals to one another

icomparable declares the compareto method which returns an integer that specifies a less than equals to or greater than relationship between two objects of the same type


scipy	pyfftw---------------------------------------------------

others
i found that numpy s 2d fft was significantly faster than scipy s but fftw was faster than both using the pyfftw bindings

edit more recent scipy does a better job of not always padding to powers of 2 length so is closer in output to the pyfftw case


clistctrl	ccombobox---------------------------------------------------

others
possibly faster than ccombobox with drawitem would be an owner data clistctrl


launch4j	jsmooth---------------------------------------------------

others
someone already mentioned launch4j however i found jsmooth to be alittle better


mouseup	mouseleave---------------------------------------------------

others
this may make for various race conditions and may necessitate using events which give you earlier notification than mouseup mousedown mouseenter mouseleave mouseover mouseout


nspopover	nsbrowser---------------------------------------------------

others
in addition i d like to display the list in an nspopover as i do on ios and placing an nsoutlineview or a nsbrowser inside a nspopover might look less than elegant


umask	chmod---------------------------------------------------

others
but changing the chmod maybe even working with umask is better than dealing with root-access and using chown


erlang	scheme---------------------------------------------------

others
just for the record the tipc addressing scheme is several years older than distributed erlang


jquery	tooltipster---------------------------------------------------

others
however lately i ve been using tooltipster instead because its integration with jquery validate is somewhat cleaner


base	fractions---------------------------------------------------

others
fractions exponents are considerably more difficult since it means essentially calculating an nth-root of the base where and multiplying the result by the result of the integer portion power calculation

memory use is a fractions of that used by the non-paged version at just under 600 kilobytes for a hundred million and just over 600 kilobytes for one billion which slight increase is just the extra space required for the base primes less than the square root of the range list

so while for the integral part you divide by base to move the more significant digits towards the decimal point for the fractions part you have to multiply by base to move the less significant digits towards the decimal


hikaricp	c3p0---------------------------------------------------

others
while you are at it you might want to try the hikaricp database connection pool instead of c3p0 i suspect hikaricp is better at recovering from broken database connections

i would also recommend you to check hikaricp as its way much better than c3p0


phpmyadmin	heidisql---------------------------------------------------

others
phpmyadmin also shows the larger number however i have switched to heidisql since i find it s gui is superior for my local development


.htaccess	httpd.conf---------------------------------------------------

others
ask your hosting company to set the limitrequestbody directive in either your httpd.conf file or a local .htaccess to be higher

the best way will be to use httpd.conf even if .htaccess seems easier

i have read that setting changes in httpd.conf are much better as compared to making changes in .htaccess as the later one is parsed at runtime while .conf is parsed at the time of starting apache

using apaches httpd.conf is faster since accessing the .htaccess adds a small overheadâ apache checks every directoryâ and parent directoryâ for the file and it will be loaded for every request

these two lines are in the .htaccess at root level of the site - the configuration in the main httpd.conf is considerably more complex but just that sets particular options for the ssl within the admin area and doesn t affect non-admin areas so i know this works whether it will for you i cannot say

doing it via mode_rewrite in httpd.conf or in .htaccess will be more efficient than doing it via a php script


root results access
instead of mucking with httpd.conf you might get better results with .htaccess

this goes in your root .htaccess but if you have access to httpd.conf that is better


libc	tcmalloc---------------------------------------------------

others
the tcmalloc library for example can be easily inserted into an application to evaluate performance gains in heavily threaded applications where tcmalloc tends to perform a lot better than libc s malloc implementation


flask-extensions	flask-security---------------------------------------------------

others
seems like this will be the case with several flask-extensions that involve more view template code than pure infrastructure like flask-security flask-login etc.


beyondcompare	winmerge---------------------------------------------------

others
my friend used beyondcompare however i am more comfortable with winmerge


tcpreplay	wireshark---------------------------------------------------

others
i use tcpreplay to replay it on an interface but the problem is that the number of attempted packets in tcpreplay is different less with number of packets showing in wireshark


rtsp	rtmp---------------------------------------------------

others
the chance of receiving video streams over http is higher than rtsp rtp rtmp and so on

all the solution works but videoview rtsp take more than 10 seconds to stat streaming from the server when rtmp take 2 seconds


np-hard	np-complete---------------------------------------------------

others
as i understand it an np-hard problem is not harder than an np-complete problem

the subset-sum problem is hard more precisely it s np-complete which means that your variant is hard too it s not np-complete because it s not a decision problem but it is np-hard


mean np best
if there exists a np-hard problem that is not in np to the best of my knowledge no such problem has been proved to fall in this category at this moment of time such problem is harder than np-complete problems

is that mean np-hard problems that are not np-complete are harder

it is not easier than the np-complete problem since it can be reduced to it in polynomial time which makes the problem np-hard


onclick	onsubmit---------------------------------------------------

dom reliable button
you can indeed execute scripts on almost any page using content scripts that can manipulate the dom allowing you to add an onsubmit event listener to a form more reliable than onclick on a button as it is fired however the form is submitted - hitting enter

edit to answer your question in comment bellow at first i thought i will bind it to button onclick event but to keep validation that is handy in this case when some questions aren t answered it notices the user about it i think form s onsubmit will be better


forms submission onsuccess
also note that for form submission it is typically better to use the onsubmit event as opposed to the onclick event since forms can technically be submitted by hitting the enter key as well as clicking the submit button

it s just a supposition but try recreating the form widget onsuccess or even hide the form onsubmit actually onclick is better and show another form to the user


others
an online search for the use of onsubmit with h commandlink indicated that onclick would be a better choice and this allowed a solution to our primary problem


vim	textmate---------------------------------------------------

others
textmate isn t known to perform well on large files but sublimetext supposedly performs better than vim on large files and yet supports legacy textmate syntax parsers

vim is more powerful and textmate is worth the price tag

i like the idea of the of editing inside the terminal and like the key bindings of vim but the text highlighting in my vim is much worse than in textmate


ienumerator	idisposable---------------------------------------------------

others
most likely for the same reason that implements idisposable but ienumerator does not--the earlier version was written before the authors thought of circumstances where one an a implementation might need cleanup but a factory returning such an implementation might not know about such need

due to ienumerator not implementing idisposable more manual ways of doing it end up being a bit fiddly.


qlineedit	qlabel---------------------------------------------------

others
qlabel has no any other unnecessary things so it is better than qlineedit or qprogressbar


orientdb	arangodb---------------------------------------------------

others
this means that arangodb can offer a greater level of compatibility with the node.js ecosystem compared to orientdb


textarea	textbox---------------------------------------------------

others
in my original project there is more than one textbox for currency description textarea chekcbox etc

i know how to remove text in a simple html textbox but html textarea seem much more complicated

edit 3 added a message to warn the user when he s been put offline + changed textbox to colored textarea to allow for longer messages + condition to clear the messagebox so that the warning message doesn t go in the conversation


n-gram	words---------------------------------------------------

others
if some characters or bigrams or n-gram occur more frequently a compression algorithm can encode this distribution skew to codes that favor the frequent occurrences with shorter code words and you get a delta of compression

i tried using collections.counter to get the each subsequent words combinations frequency count and print all n-gram that come up more than 2 times sorted by value

arun s suggestion is not bad but the n-gram alone are more geared to find general fractions of words

the problem is that you re not going to find appropriate statistics for all possible words. character n-gram statistics are easier to accumulate and more robust even for text without typos words in a language tend to follow the same spelling patterns

it has support for tokenizing lemmatizing n-gram ideas that span more than one words

furthermore it is handier than google n-gram as for a given phrase it does not simply output its absolute frequency but it can output its joint probability conditional probability and even the most likely words that follow

shouldn t the character n-gram have a lower test error since it extracted more features than the words features

if you will be classifying multi-paragraph text all in one language a functional words list which your bag of words with pruning of hapaxes will quickly approximate might well serve you perfectly and could work better than n-gram

for some problems character level n-gram do better than words level and logistic regression parameters


median	max---------------------------------------------------

others
to find the median and left right you probably want to call it to find the median and then just do the max of the components of the array to the left and the min of the components to the right because you know once the median selection phase is done that all elements to the left of the median will be less than it and to the right will be greater or equal

so the t 7n 10 is the part of continuing the equation with the max segment of numbers that is larger smaller than the median of medians..

so after calculating median of first k elements delete the first element directly from heap min or max according to whether it is greater or less than median using pointers and then use heapify at that position

i also microbenchmarked and the mean median min and max were all faster for the lattice plotting function compared to the high charts rcharts plotting function

therefore the max number of elements you could have that are greater than or less than the median of median is 3 10 + 2 10 + 2 10 7 10


jquery	icheck---------------------------------------------------

others
i ve been trying to apply icheck plugins to my radio and checkbox and i just cannot figure out why my radio button keep selecting more than a single option with no experience in jquery i think i might need help with this


rsa	private-key---------------------------------------------------

others
essentially all rsa implementations for about 30 years do not simply do c up d mod n as shown in the first few paragraphs of wikipedia or billions of blogs copied from brief news clippings or exceprts from decades ago but instead use a more complicated private-key that supports the more efficient chinese remainder theorem computation as explained if you read all of the wikipedia article or look at a text by an author who actually knows about modern cryptography


webclient	webrequest---------------------------------------------------

others
to get the html instead of hardcoding it as above use the webclient class since it has a simplier api than webrequest

or if you feel more comfortable with webclient i personnally prefer it over webrequest

update i ve created a webhelper class that takes the place of webclient but provides more access to the necessary features of the underlying webrequest

for finer grained control you might find webrequest to be more useful but webclient seems the best fit for your needs

webrequest just offers you more functonality than webclient

webclient is a shorter and more concise syntax but behind the scenes it uses a webrequest so in terms of performance it won t be faster it will be equivalent


simpler easier
a webclient is much easier than a webrequest

webclient is sometimes easier to use than webrequest

webclient is simpler to use than webrequest


nerdtree	netrw---------------------------------------------------

last better
last question is nerdtree really much better than netrw

is nerdtree really much better than netrw


others
in the netrw plugin it would be easy but this one is not used any more as nerdtree just replaced it

vim already comes with a file explorer that does a lot more than nerdtree called netrw

however vim comes by default with another plugin which does a lot more than nerdtree called netrw help netrw

vim includes netrw which is already a filebrowser and i like it a lot more than nerdtree


treemap	treeset---------------------------------------------------

others
there is also the treeset class that probably is what you need but since it is just a wrapper to treemap the direct use of treemap would be faster


ilist	icollection---------------------------------------------------

interfaces idictionary interface
idictionary and ilist are more specialized interfaces that extend icollection

ilist is a more specialized interface that extend icollection


others
icollection adds counting and ilist then gives richer functionality including find add and remove elements by index or via lambda expressions


completionhandler	nsurlsession---------------------------------------------------

others
using completionhandler -based methods of nsurlsession is much easier


associativity	operator-precedence---------------------------------------------------

others
taking java s operator-precedence notably that + has higher precedence than and associativity rules into account the expression is equivalent to


rodbc	rjdbc---------------------------------------------------

others
rjdbc may also be a more stable option in the linux environment especially now that the fetch code has been re-written in java as of development release 0.2-0 on r-forge its performance is on par with if not better than rodbc

rodbc takes longer than rjdbc

now the speed of sql server interaction with r has affected because rjdbc is slower than rodbc but its not too bad


openssl	libcrypto---------------------------------------------------

others
since apparently all those packages mentioned require that specific versioning of libcrypto which again does not seem to be present inside the rpm you are trying to install this leaves only one solution you d have to upgrade all those packages to versioning accepting the newer openssl versioning themselves


glibc	tcmalloc---------------------------------------------------

available malloc faster
tcmalloc is faster than the glibc 2.3 malloc available as a separate library called ptmalloc2 and other malloc s that i have tested

tcmalloc is faster than the glibc 2.3 malloc.


others
jemalloc and tcmalloc with some setting changes can be more aggressive than glibc to release memory to the os - but again it depends on the allocation patterns

then we found glibc also have same issue but increase rate is less than tcmalloc


sequence	permutation---------------------------------------------------

others
the result of the above function will give you a list of sequence that are all less than the length which is key when considering potential permutation 100 is fairly short so there is a vast number of permutation that can be readily discarded

if you are happy with this sequence of permutation there is little more to do


qcheckbox	qfilesystemmodel---------------------------------------------------

others
i need show files from qfilesystemmodel in qtreeview and customize that tree to show one more column with qcheckbox so user can pick 0..n files from that qtreeview


partcover	opencover---------------------------------------------------

others
opencover is newer and is also on github opencover on github it has 64 and 32 bit support and overcomes some of the limitations that partcover has memory and results delivery

you may also find that opencover will work better than partcover as it has 32 and 64 bit support as well as supporting .net2 and .net4 - and copes much better with target processes that spin off more processes to do the actual testing


mouseover	mouseup---------------------------------------------------

others
this may make for various race conditions and may necessitate using events which give you earlier notification than mouseup mousedown mouseenter mouseleave mouseover mouseout


vsts	tfs---------------------------------------------------

others
however if you are looking to migrate to vsts things are much more complicated and you will need to upgrade to tfs 2017 rtm at a minimum

unless something has changed a lot with 2010 the basic vsts install is more or less the same as the pro version of vs - and then you install the team explorer on top to gain the tfs specific client-side extensions

however we don t want to interrupt developers for whom using vsts will be better choice then tfs


junit	testng---------------------------------------------------

work honest little
not sure if it ll work any better than junit but there is testng

i know this can be achieved with junit but in my experience it is easier with testng

powermockito might integrate a little easier with testng but i have never used it with junit

isn t testng supposed to a better than junit

if you are familiar of using junit it is easier to switch into testng

to be perfectly honest i junit is way more popular than testng at least here where i work and live


testing integration framework
also for integartion testing i have found testng to be much easier to use that junit because it has features that make writing integration tests easier

you may want to use junit in the part of unit testing but testng is more than a unite testing framework

in case if you have flexibility to choose another testing framework you can try with testng which has bigger feature set than junit

testng has more capabilities and can be helpful with integration tests junit is more focused on unit tests

i actually picked junit over testng for android testing i thought it was more lightweight than testng for on-device testing

twip for parameterized testing the junit stuff isn t the greatest in fact testng does this better as well -

if you re doing non-unit testing testng might be a better option than junit


others
edit it seems junit has more printed books as references compared to testng on amazon

in our approach our test framework extends the standard test case class junit in our case but testng seems more capable that sets up and tears down the various database dependecies with each test using the following steps

junit is more direct and simpel to use if you start to learn java testng has more features but maybe is more complex

will testng run my older tests written in junit

testng is more flexible than junit and have multiple advantages like support for parallel testing for example

yes with testng you have way more power over those local variables that you did with junit and the dataprovider handles your threading per test-class-instance

if you have to do a lot of this honestly testng is more flexible but you can absolutely get it done in junit

here is what it would look like with testng it s a little more contrived with junit since you can t pass parameters directly to test functions

personally i would recommend testng although if you re just starting junit is slightly less of a learning curve

testng strives to be much more configurable than junit but in the end they both work equally well

testng is much friendlier to this paradigm than junit though

testng offers you more options and possibilites how to run your tests and in which order especially something junit can t

firstly i am not sure how to properly use multi-thread with junit last time i tried i had no success anyway i have had better results with testng


solution params extension
if there is a junit extension or similar framework that provides a better solution than testng then please let me know

go with junit params or testng which offer much more convenient solution


rpm	yum---------------------------------------------------

others
yum makes it easier to maintain groups of machines without having to manually update each one using rpm

to expand on the udo s answer there is the program rpm which manipulates specifically the packages it is asked to manipulate and there is yum which is a more intelligent management system that can find dependencies and download .rpm files even if they re not in the system

both commands works in the same way only difference is yum list installed output maybe bigger than rpm -qa because yum will show package dependencies also in its output


requestfactory	gwt-rpc---------------------------------------------------

others
my understanding is the requestfactory is more efficient and recommended over gwt-rpc but it s more of a data entity persistence framework than a request-response framework like rpc

go with gwt-rpc or better newer with requestfactory


pthreads	usleep---------------------------------------------------

others
compared to sleep 3 and usleep 3 nanosleep has the advantage of not affecting any signals it is standardized by pthreads it provides higher timing resolution and it allows to continue a sleep that has been interrupted by a signal more easily


gitorious	gitosis---------------------------------------------------

others
if you have some product-specific stuff git could be installed with gitosis gitolite gitorious provide more details as to how you ve done it


cobertura	emma---------------------------------------------------

others
however cobertura looks more modern active last update from 2010 instead of 2005 and generates nicer reports so i would prefer it over emma

if you re going to stick with maven and want a plugin for maven that will do the code-coverage job i think cobertura is a better choice as emma stable last build is from 2005


mockito	easymock---------------------------------------------------

others
for the second test you should favor mockito over easymock that is more easy effective flexible and powerful to use

the easymock support is complete but the mockito plugin needs some more work

i m more familiar with easymock than mockito so i had to do a little digging


mouseover	mouseleave---------------------------------------------------

others
also you might want to use mouseenter and mouseleave which are sanitized by jquery and are a little more reliable than mouseover and mouseout

imho mouseenter and mouseleave are much more reliable than mouseover and mouseout which tend to flicker

also instead of mouseover and mouseout use the better ones mouseenter and mouseleave or simply the .hover method

because jquery doesn t use mouseover and mouseout it uses mouseenter and mouseleave which are more suited to this scenario


alternative work behaviour
it should also be noted that mouseenter and mouseleave work somewhat differently and usually much better than mouseover and mouseout

i have no idea about the classes but i think mouseenter and mouseleave are better alternative for mouseout and mouseover

in this case mouseenter mouseleave has better behaviour and prevents bubbling compared to mouseover mouseout


flann	surf---------------------------------------------------

others
its however best to used flann based matchers for sift or surf since they extract a higher number of keypoint as compared to orb and flann is suited to large sets of keypoint read more about it here


junit	powermockito---------------------------------------------------

others
i am going to need to use powermockito - mockito to create some more tests but before i start writing those tests i am just switching the junit runner to powermockrunner

powermockito might integrate a little easier with testng but i have never used it with junit


weka	libsvm---------------------------------------------------

others
nb weka contains its own implementation - smo but it also provides wrapper for libsvm and libsvm runs faster than smo note that it requires installed libsvm see docs

i am using a sparse format but suggestions are welcome on other formats too i am able to use the data with weka in a dense format using the function names as variables and it works just muuch slower than with libsvm


hive	hdfs---------------------------------------------------

others
you should see impala as sql on hdfs while hive is more sql on hadoop

i know hive may perform better creating new rows from existing tables or from files saved in hdfs but i m trying to avoid this

plus the overhead of doing it is extremely costly- hive queries against hbase are on my cluster at least an order of magnitude slower than against plain hdfs files


printf	fgets---------------------------------------------------

others
also i d use fgets rather than scanf as it is inherently safer for the same reason that printf is safer than printf


groupbox	flowlayoutpanel---------------------------------------------------

others
by the way we also added the flowdirection topdown to the flowlayoutpanel but if the groupbox become smaller it places them side by side instead of topdown


asp.net-mvc	openrasta---------------------------------------------------

others
i d suggest having a look at openrasta which is much closer to http semantics than asp.net asp.net-mvc is


glmnet	predict---------------------------------------------------

others
the predict function for a glmnet is more than likely just predict.glmnet


mediacodec	mediarecorder---------------------------------------------------

others
i d like to use mediacodec to encode the data coming from the camera reason it s more low-level so hopefully faster than using mediarecorder

the gles recording examples uses mediacodec rather than mediarecorder but the idea is the same and it should be much simpler with mediarecorder

android 5.0 api 21 allows surface input to mediarecorder which is often much more convenient than mediacodec


button	right-align---------------------------------------------------

others
a right-align fixed width button looks better imho

instead of figuring out the individual positions for each image button it is easier to simply right-align them by modifying the anchorpoint to 1.0f 0.5f and then position the images button at exactly the screen width and variable screen height position screen width 100


ucma	ucwa---------------------------------------------------

others
old thread but in my experience writing server-side code with ucma is somewhat easier than trying to use ucwa - and all that ucwa really is is a ucma application sitting on your lync s4b server with a rest wrapper


caliburn	prism---------------------------------------------------

others
prism is more of a modularity framework and caliburn is more of a mvvm framework i know both have overlapping features but it would be great to take best features from two frameworks when they are combined


getter	setter---------------------------------------------------

others
the code in the setter is far more interesting than the getter should it not take precedence and be defined first

the first file also has some potential issues such as declaring a method that appears to be a getter without declaring a property for the ivar same with the setter would be better to just declare a property

i am trying to create one getter for all my fields using a switch case because otherwise i would have to create a lot of setter there are more cases than displayed here

what i find strange is that the getter for distance depends on status and the setter acts more like a setter for status

getter are usually fine as the caller can t change the object but unnecessary setter can make it more difficult to reason about an object especially when writing concurrent code

but then your setter is less restricted than your getter which is odd.

is this even possible for starters because this is about adding protocols to setter and a getter is much more easy like

setter are a better example but there s a need arising from the use of object-returning getter as well

you can override the setter s level to be lower than the getter s level with either private set or internal set

in the example the getter is still public like the entire property while the setter has a more restricted access here private

note that the test bean has a very special design as the getter returns a more general type number than the setter requests integer

the setter complexity can be higher than the getter and thus validate a unit-test

a getter without a setter is more like a public final member variable--but at that point why not just use a public final member variable they do no more harm.

it is often useful to have different accesses for the two most often a more restrictive setter than getter and so the likes of

the first one setter anad getter can be more expressive than the second one tell don ask

in other words the getter should contain nothing more than a call to getvalue and the setter should contain nothing more than a call to setvalue

but it doesn t seem possible to roundtrip the geometry as there are less setter than getter the geometry cannot be re-constructed from an empty object just by calling setter

for a unity3d game i m working on i have a situation where i want a read writeable property with a trivial getter but a setter which does some more work

the performance of technique 2 is significantly better than technique 1 in situations where the getter is called much more often than the setter

if the calculation is expensive or the getter is executed more often than the setter for the changeable properties playername by far it can be an optimization to change the property inside the class into a read-write property and set the value every time the changeable properties are changed

by using jrebel the magic that it does confused eclipse making simple getter and simple setter look more complicated than they originally are


parameter value parameters
if your getter takes more than one argument it s not called a setter anymore

or if your getter takes parameters or your setter takes more than a value parameter


xfce	gnome---------------------------------------------------

others
since the more mainstream wms like gnome or kde become more and more resource hungry it wasn t long before i replaced gnome with xfce on laptops and desktop computers

you might want to look at one of these options if you re running in a vm since xfce is slightly lighter weight than gnome although not all that much lighter these days

xfce runs much smaller than gnome and is full featured


nexus	artifactory---------------------------------------------------

filesystem maven-centric database
i will not argue why and if nexus is better than artifactory as it would not be fair and would only cause flame wars

if they are going to use any non-maven way to retrieve them ui rest scripts ant gradle then you can go with any path and name you like and you ll get full support from artifactory uploading searching etc. with nexus which is much more maven-centric you ll better stick to maven notation

nexus looks better choice than artifactory because of using filesystem instead of database to keep repository


others
on price and support alone then nexus pro makes sense until you get to 67 users at which point artifactory becomes the cheaper option

i would recommend artifactory much better than the nexus


flask	pyramid---------------------------------------------------

others
frameworks like flask cherrypy pyramid or even web2py might be the easier ones to start with


fadein	hide---------------------------------------------------

others

effect softer appropriate
note the show hide effect is much softer because of the commented fadein fadeout declarations that were triggering console errors probably because jsfiddle uses jquery slim now

or more ideally you might want to change show hide to jquery fadein fadeout which is more appropriate for back to top indicators


strcpy	malloc---------------------------------------------------

others
additionally if you have strdup then it is much more convenient than strlen + malloc + strcpy with identical result including the same obligation to free the allocated storage when you no longer need it


strlen faster cleaner
or indeed if your system has strdup or you re willing to write an implementation then strdup is much cleaner than malloc + strcpy

because of the above replace strdup with strlen malloc memcpy memcpy is slightly faster than strcpy


titlebar	window---------------------------------------------------

others
the reason i ask is i am running proficy ifix 5.0 and when i run aero it adds annoying scrollbars to everything as the titlebar of the window is bigger than it normally is

apparently windows won t allow the width of the window to be smaller than the space required for the buttons and icon on the titlebar


apache-fop	xhtml---------------------------------------------------

others
xhtml has a stronger syntax than html and is easier to convert to apache-fop this way


many-to-one	one-to-many---------------------------------------------------

others
fifth many-to-one is much easier to use correctly in nhibernate and i assume hibernate than one-to-many collection mapping

inverse is for bidirectional associations and most often it s on the same side with cascade but that s because the many-to-one side is much more efficient to control the association than the one-to-many one


atomic	lockless---------------------------------------------------

others
about this time new research into locking and lockless algorithms showed that atomic compareandset was a more flexible primitive to have so more modern cpus have that as an instruction


qcodo	qcubed---------------------------------------------------

others
qcubed community is much stronger at the moment so you might want to check in qcodo forum for your answers on basic problems but post on the qcubed forum


factories	presenter---------------------------------------------------

others
more specifically - use an objectcontainerdatasource from the web client software factories to make it easier to bridge between the current ui and a set of new presenter classes

which is basically the same thing as the factories then depend on sub-factories but at least they are lighter than presenter views services and they don t need to load the sub-factories until they are needed

a presenter is better to accept some kind of a view factories or a supplier in general as we can already hold an existing view especially in a gwt case and let the presenter decide when instantiate or accept the view


css-preprocessor	stylus---------------------------------------------------

others
i would suggest kicking bootstrap and using plain media queries optionally using whatever css-preprocessor you like like stylus sass scss less ...


vpn	lan---------------------------------------------------

others
the reason why the vpn is slow is well because your vpn is likely 50 to 100 times slower than your lan local area network


16-bit	64bit---------------------------------------------------

others
any char can be to the compiler various lengths depending on the compiler settings including 7 bits rare these days 8 bits what most people think it is 16-bit getting more common especially with unicode i have even come across machine compiler combinations that would store each char in a 64bit locations

in that case the answer is basically both. normally int won t be bigger than a processor register unless that s smaller than 16-bit but it could be smaller a 32-bit compiler running on a 64bit processor

sometimes when a less than 32-bit 64bit variable is accesses from memory the processor will read 32 bits set the apprpriate 8 or 16-bit then write back the whole register

that s obviously quite a bit more than the 16-bit that s mandated for an int but equally obviously less than the 64bit mandated for a long long

fixed length different settings best explained with an example - the first 4 bits indicate the length 00 means there are 2-bits following to indicate the distance 01 means 4-bits 10 means 8-bits 11 means 16-bit if there s a chance of more than 16-bit you may want to do something like - 110 means 16-bit 1110 means 32-bits 11110 means 64bit etc


32-bit integer efficient
some older 32-bit x86 cpus also worked internally with 32-bit integers and operations on 16-bit integers required more clock cycles due to translation to from 32-bit this is not true with more modern 32-bit or 64bit x86 processors as they allow copying 16-bit integers to from 32-bit registers and operating on them with fewer such penalties

in fact for x86 64 processors performing 32-bit or 16-bit operations are less efficient than 64bit or 8-bit operations due to the operand prefix byte that has to be decoded

since a 53-bit mantissa is too large to fit in less than four 16-bit registers or two 32-bit registers performing an addition with a 64bit mantissa isn t any slower than using a 53-bit mantissa so using extended-precision math offers faster computation with no downside in a language which supports a proper type to hold temporary results

it logically follows that 64bit integer is faster than 32-bit and when it comes to 64bit cpu s using a 16-bit data as fast as possible int_fast16_t would have int_fast16_min defined to int64_min instead of the int32_min specified in stdint.h


greater int convenient
how many chars you can pack into it depends on the size of int which varies across platforms typically one of 16 32 or 64bit but it could be anything else greater than 16-bit

most machines now end up with sizeof int sizeof long because 16-bit is no longer convenient but we have long long to get 64bit if needed

the standard only requires that int be larger than 16-bit and no larger than a long so it s not 64bit safe

a number bigger than 64bit can never occur in a multiplication because c is an unsigned integer of 32 bits and k is a unsigned short of 16-bit

on today s desktop systems an int is usually 32 or 64bit wide for a correspondingly much larger range than the 16-bit 32767 32768 you are talking of


textmate	aptana---------------------------------------------------

others
in studio 3 much of this sort of functionality is still coming as aptana is going more of a textmate bundle route for a great deal of their features which i think is really cool


highcharts	rgraph---------------------------------------------------

others
i have found highcharts to have a steeper learning curve than flot or rgraph imho


ember.js	backbone.js---------------------------------------------------

others
on a side note if one is starting with a large scale javascript application at present using angular.js may be more suited than knockout.js if you prefer declarative approach dom attribute based data-binding and mvvm pattern and ember.js may be more suited than backbone.js if you prefer mvc and string based handlebars templates

ember.js would make things even simpler than backbone.js

i checked a lot of resources on the internet on how to go about structuring ember.js projects but compared to backbone.js resources are fewer and the tutorials i do find do not provide an explicit answer

but on the other hand although new the ember.js package is actually more complete imo than backbone.js

i already know that ember.js is a more heavy weight approach in contrast to backbone.js

the complexity with ember.js happens when you want to do something the non-ember way in which case backbone.js can allow for more flexibility

ember.js is larger than backbone.js but thanks to expires cache-control this only matters on the the first load

both give you the ability to implement things in a variety of ways which can be confusing but ember.js provides more of the code that you would have to write yourself in backbone.js as standard which for me personally is more important for rapid prototyping than the wealth of backbone.js examples available

there are many options for client-side mvc or mvvm code organization such as knockout.js and ember.js but personnally i prefer backbone.js which has less magic but offers more control


nant	cruisecontrol---------------------------------------------------

others
if you are taking a more open source approach such as teamcity cruisecontrol then nant may be better

think about project management bug reports and it all adds up to something more than just cruisecontrol svn and nant


user-controls	tabcontrol---------------------------------------------------

others
some user-controls s are larger than the tabcontrol and got clipped so i modified its template by wrapping the contentpresenter in a scrollviewer with horizontalscrollbarvisibility and verticalscrollbarvisibility set to auto


margin	font-size---------------------------------------------------

others
margin .67em 0 applies a top and bottom margin based on the font-size which is fairly large so that explains why the margin becomes larger when you disable the other one

if you don t want to give padding or margin at all then set the line-height property of headings more than their font-size

my website in developing process looking in mozilla firefox with same font-size declaration margin padding and different font-families always a few smaller than in google-chrome or internet explorer

the problem is that all inline child elements get a huge margin above them even if their font-size is much smaller


dateadd	strtotime---------------------------------------------------

others
that said the date class is much better in php5.3 -- it even has dateadd subtract functions which would also solve your problem much better than strtotime .


imperative	declarative---------------------------------------------------

others
traditionally there was a huge difference in speed imperative has fewer overheads because it s more directly like the computer works but some more modern compilers of declarative code seem to be in the top few of the speed tables a lot of the time - compiled verses interpreted makes a much bigger difference than imperative vs declarative which is why python etc are often slower even though they re imperative

as a coder sql is my weakest link since i am far more comfortable with imperative languages than declarative ones - but i want to change that

i think that functional declarative programming haskell scheme lisp etc is more powerful and more abstract than imperative programming and therefore is intrinsically harder to learn

if xml json and xaml have teached us anything it s that declarative languages are much better suited to create object graphs than imperative ones

while neither the declarative nor imperative approach is really better than the other both have their merits

imperative is the traditional step by step recipe approach while declarative is more this is what i want now you work out how to do it

declarative sql is usually simpler and faster than imperative pl sql so it s usually best to do most of the work in sql and just glue it together with pl sql

now my question is if there s any circumstances that if we use declarative too much it will confuse the developer who read the code and switching back to imperative is a better solution

what i have understood is that declarative let you do whatever you want as long as the result passes and imperative is more verbose

while it is possible to explore non-imperative computer concepts it doesn t seem to be worth the effort at the current time - building a declarative machine as an interpreter on top of an imperative machine is much cheaper and faster than a true declarative machine

declarative code is easier to make bug-free than imperative code

what s bad about this is that when microsoft were designing asp.net mvc they opted for declarative validation logic using data annotations instead of imperative which is much better suited to validation scenarios and can handle just anything

angular is built around the belief that declarative code is better than imperative when it comes to building uis and wiring software components together.

also one benefit of declarative programming is that purpose is usually more easily understood from reading the code whereas imperative gives you finer control over execution

we can state that hive is declarative and sit on higher level of abstraction then imperative pig


simpler understanding business
declarative programming is not always simpler than imperative programming

i ve been teaching myself a bit about declarative vs imperative programming and i ve come to the possibly false understanding that declarative programming is more or less just abstraction

i know that declarative way is cleaner but sometimes imperative programming makes your business safer


freshmvvm	mvvmcross---------------------------------------------------

others
it s very heavyweight and not fully featured for forms so prism or freshmvvm works better as these are designed for forms from the ground up but if you do use mvvmcross for forms its easy to go native if you need


idictionary	iequalitycomparer---------------------------------------------------

others
using iequalitycomparer which is better because works without altering initial idictionary signature


coldfusion	railo---------------------------------------------------

others
there are many other small differences railo is generally stricter about syntax and semantics than adobe coldfusion and often those decisions are driven by performance concerns in that compatibility with adobe coldfusion would make railo slower

note line value may be inaccurate in adobe coldfusion though railo is much better with this


phpunit	simpletest---------------------------------------------------

others
subjective phpunit provides much nicer code coverage reports than simpletest

is there any easy php testing framework and may be simpler than simpletest and not command line based like phpunit

phpunit is more popular and up to date as simpletest hasn t had a new release for some time though for testing webforms it s still very useful as phpunit does not have good support for that


best opinion easier
i found simpletest was even easier than phpunit to set up

simpletest is slightly easier to grasp but phpunit is the best in my opinion at least so if you want to start learning and using a framework start with the one you re going to use when you ll be a master in tdd


scikit-learn	libsvm---------------------------------------------------

others
the libsvm results seems much more stable but scikit-learn results have some drastic fluctuation

you can also try sklearn.linear_model.logisticregression and sklearn.svm.linearsvc both implemented using liblinear that is more scalable than libsvm albeit less memory efficients than other linear models in scikit-learn


parsley	robotlegs---------------------------------------------------

others
parsley is more robust and adds a lot more features than robotlegs which is why its been used in the world s largest flex applications


azure	hdinsight---------------------------------------------------

others
running with azure batch is also an option as the .net will work well and azure batch is cheaper if the custom activity is the only reason for having a hdinsight cluster


crossover	mutation---------------------------------------------------

others
bits so more crossover points are possible also inside a floating point number or is the better solution to set the mutation rate higher and let mutation add more variation in the next generation

mutation is typically easier to do this with than crossover

when i use only mutation i find better solutions than when i add in crossover


unification	inference---------------------------------------------------

others
because the unification performed as part of type inference transcends quantifier scope you can sometimes end up in a situation where ghc would have to unify a type variable in an outer scope with a quantified type from a nested scope which is how you get compiler errors about escaping types and skolems and whatnot the latter i assume being related to skolem normal form


vbscript	jscript---------------------------------------------------

others
i am much more experienced with vbscript than jscript but i will give it a shot since not many takers on this question

when writing code in jscript as i am wont to do as i have never been a fan of asp.net and jscript is infinitely more elegant than vbscript you can call upon the arguments collection

on contrary jscript is more c-like do not require explicit enabling of script running accepts relative paths case sensitive and loosely typed both are imho advantages for scripting language compared to vbscript

asp with jscript is 100 times better cleaner simpler nicer than vbscript and makes my job a joy rather than a vbscript head ache


bat simpler segment
the inclusion of jscript code into a batch file is simpler than vbscript and the translation of a small code segment from vbs to jscript is not problematic

...i suggest doing all of the scripting from within the vbscript file and avoiding the use of .cmd .bat files completely if you can as vbscript is much more readable and powerful though i prefer using the jscript language instead but that s just me


nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception---------------------------------------------------

disclaimer idiomatic
disclaimer all this would be needed just to throw an illegalargumentexception which is less idiomatic than a nullpointerexception

arguably throwing a nullpointerexception would be more idiomatic than throwing an illegalargumentexception though


others
in my mind illegalargumentexception seems more specific than using a nullpointerexception since it s telling me that the problem was with an argument i passed to the method and not with a value that may have been generated while performing the method

decoding nullpointerexception is going to take a bit longer than illegalargumentexception filepath must be supplied or whatever

there are some instances of implementations that i have seen for some methods that throw nullpointerexception if argument is null but that is wrong implementation in those cases illegalargumentexception makes much more sense

notice my use of illegalargumentexception instead of nullpointerexception - the illegalargumentexception is more in line with what you re hoping to achieve

as others have said illegalargumentexception is an option but i think nullpointerexception is more communicative

since it s an exported method clients should get an exception on their abstraction level so illegalargumentexception is better than nullpointerexception

also throwing illegalargumentexception makes more sense instead of nullpointerexception when string has blank empty or null values


readr	tidyverse---------------------------------------------------

others
we can use tidyverse extract from tidyr to split group into group and decision then replace the group value to 1 if the percentage extracted the number with parse_number from readr is greater than or equal to 90


inline	constexpr---------------------------------------------------

others
you may be interested in looking at the constexpr keyword which i think is better than the inline keyword when you can make use of it


gridbaglayout	miglayout---------------------------------------------------

expressive convenient open-source
miglayout works similarly to gridbaglayout but is more powerful and more expressive

you can also check out the open-source miglayout which is much more convenient that gridbaglayout and also a bit more powerful


others
same effect but this approach is less verbose unlike in case of gridbaglayout and i personally think that miglayout is easier to use

it sounds to me like gridbaglayout would be a better fit for you either that or miglayout though you ll have to download that first since it s not part of standard java

look at the quick start guide on the miglayout site it s a lot less difficult than gridbaglayout and much more powerful

edit for clarification miglayout is probably easier to use than gridbaglayout but if you get familiar with gridbaglayout it s not that hard to use and it doesn t require a download since it s part of the core java library


mdpi	hdpi---------------------------------------------------

android layout-sw320dp-land layout-sw720dp-land
owing to the fact that the screens density on the tablet is smaller android therefore uses the images in the mdpi folder for the tablet and the slightly bigger ones in the hdpi folder for the phone

layout-sw320dp-land will pick up drawable from hdpi folder whereas layout-sw720dp-land is mdpi device so it will pick up drawables from mdpi folder which will be smaller than hdpi


screens larger image
images in these different folders should have different physical pixel sizes mdpi has smaller images than hdpi but the images pixel densities aren t used

if in java code the values would be in pixels so 50px on mdpi screens will look larger than on hdpi screens

a ldpi image on a hdpi screens would appear smaller than the same image on a mdpi or ldpi screens

in my android app i have a background image which is longer than the screens width for all the three types of screens.this implies that i have got 3 drawables each for different screens type mdpi ldpi hdpi and hence i have included a horizontal scroll bar in my app

each device has a density like hdpi ldpi and mdpi tablet have even more

your normal sized image should be optimized for mdpi 160dpi while the ldpi image is 25 smaller 120dpi and the hdpi image is 50 larger 240dpi

proportionally the hdpi screens is slightly taller than the mdpi screens

when you put images into hdpi folder their appearance is smaller than from mdpi and ldpi

example if using dp unit hdpi device will have 1.5 240 160 times larger than mdpi

now a days most of the devices at least fall under hdpi range mdpi ldpi are being less popular now

ldpi assets will look bad on high density screens but are exponentially smaller than mdpi which is exponentially smaller than hdpi etc

try placing youre images in res mdpi they will be streched to fit screens which are bigger hdpi xhdpi

and you know your image at hdpi folder so its 1.5 larger than the mdpi


others
for example mdpi is basically 72dpi as your computer monitor hdpi resources should be around 1.5 times larger than mdpi resources and so forth

as mdpi is less than hdpi so it will take the values from the folder which is least below it in you case it is values which is applicable to all

ideally the hdpi version of your button should be 1.5 times bigger than the mdpi baseline version

so as i said - mdpi also doesn t means that your screens resolution is less than hdpi screens resolution

the system will pick the closest match and mdpi is closer to hdpi than to xxhdpi


graphic 72x72 48x48
first of all if you anyhow provide a hdpi graphic adding an mdpi and ldpi graphic which both are less than the hdpi graphic in size there is approximately 3 4 6 scaling ratio will increase the size but far from triple it more close to double

if the screens density is less than xhdpi i load smaller sampled sizes of the 96x96 image - as 36x36 for ldpi 48x48 for mdpi 72x72 for hdpi


nsurl	nsdata---------------------------------------------------

others
1 it seems loading the sound file through nsdata rather than nsurl works faster later in playing

so if i modify the nsurl path with a new image because nsdata bytes is already greater than 0 i don t make the additional call to fetch the new image


uploadify	plupload---------------------------------------------------

others
ok after a whole day of trying to get this to work i ve abandoned uploadify and am now using plupload which seems much better


np-hard	subset-sum---------------------------------------------------

others
the subset-sum problem is hard more precisely it s np-complete which means that your variant is hard too it s not np-complete because it s not a decision problem but it is np-hard


decoder	encoder---------------------------------------------------

others
i find that if i configure the width and height of the output format of the encoder bigger the capacity of both the input and output buffer of the encoder will be bigger too.and they are very near in values.and when i configure the width and height as the orignal video size the input buffer is big enough to hold the raw output buffer of the decoder and i get the output video file.but i want to get a smaller size and smaller bit size video

in the end you have a scheme whose encoder is more complex but whose decoder couldn t be simpler

what about using more than one encoder to encode my code because if we take a look at ioncube you will see some people can decoder it

making an encoder seemed easy enough but i m not sure if this encoder is making it harder to build a decoder


lxml	elementtree---------------------------------------------------

api world effective
while celementtree is fast the world standard lxml library which also implements the elementtree is faster still

lxml is faster than elementtree but i ve never found an application where the speed boost paid for the hassles of distribution

but in general you will find that lxml is faster more effective and has an api which adheres closely to a python standard the elementtree which comes with the python standard library


others
with those step i can import lxml and got no more problem with from lxml import elementtree

although lxml has better documentation better xpath support and better code for technical reasons i cannot use lxml so i am forced to use elementtree

lxml uses libxml2 and provides a nicer interface the elementtree so you get most of the benefit of libxml2 s speed and all of the benefit of it s xpath evaluation

for xml documents it may be that the elementtree offered by lxml is more productive

note please do tell me if lxml is more easy or this elementtree

if for some reason you want to use an implementation that does not give you a full parse tree then i would suggest parsing the resulting html using lxml a python wrapper of the c lib or html5lib pure python both of which can return an elementtree object and are much faster especially lxml and more forgiving of invalid html especially html5lib which acts more like real browsers in the real world

elementtree is included in the standard library but lxml is faster

lxml -- 100x better than elementtree


altera	xilinx---------------------------------------------------

others
xilinx tools suck but their raw silicon is better than altera


do.call	rep---------------------------------------------------

others
if you include the explicit rbind version it is slightly faster than the do.call rbind rep list a n version but not by much and slower than either the apply or matrix versions


vert.x	netty---------------------------------------------------

others
also vert.x has little bit better benchmarks than netty


ienumerable	iqueryable---------------------------------------------------

others
i m not familiar with the infeasability of iqueryable but this blog post seems to indicate that iqueryable is much more preferable to ienumerable because iqueryable allows access to the underlying expression

for your view to expect an ienumerable you need to change your view declaration to be also if you really need to perform a find use iqueryable first them return the result as ienumerable since the payload on ienumerable is smaller than iqueryable

there is a very good linq video that i enjoy a lot- it hits more than just ienumerable v iqueryable but it really has some fantastic insight

in my reading it seemed iqueryable had more functionality for linq to sql but since i am returning a simple two column list then i only need to return an ienumerable or list

in simple words all operations on ienumerable causes simple iteratation over all elements well it s lazy ienumerable really slower than iqueryable

the ienumerable side of linq which works on in-memory objects that are already in the heap will almost certainly perform better than the iqueryable side which exists to be translated into a native query language like sql

can you provide any useful example that shows ienumerable could be more useful than iqueryable

so if you working with only in-memory data collection ienumerable is a good choice but if you want to query data collection which is connected with database iqueryable is a better choice as it reduces network traffic and uses the power of sql language

however the method that returns iqueryable takes 15 seconds while the ienumerable takes less than a second

final result will be of type ienumerable and in terms of performance this would be better than iqueryable since here join is taking place between in memory collections

this may be safer as iqueryable inherits from ienumerable

i assume applying iqueryable will be much faster than the ienumerable not to forget i was able to use iqueryable on the other entities without any issues


entity framework objects
i often use such code with the entity framework and iqueryable to generate smaller sql queries but it works just as well for linq to objects ienumerable

entity framework s iqueryable implementation is more picky about creating new objects in objects than regular linq to objects ienumerable


generic instances
ienumerable is more generic than iqueryable though all instances of iqueryable implement ienumerable and only defines

ienumerable is more generic than iqueryable though all


better query types
what i know is using iqueryable is better than ienumerable if another query is going to be performed

or perhaps ienumerable is better since ienumerable types can be cast to iqueryable to be used with linq


database quicker calls
i d say iqueryable is more suitable for interaction with a database than ienumerable is

with really basic calls to the database iqueryable is way quicker but when do i need to think about using an ienumerable in its place


qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene---------------------------------------------------

pixmap window necessary
by default when you scale a qgraphicsscene larger than the qgraphicsview in which it is displayed it will show the necessary scroll bars

if i set a pixmap to a qgraphicsscene that is larger that the window it will add scrollbars so is it possible to get what is displayed in the qgraphicsview


others
i have a qgraphicsview nested within a few widgets qframe and then in a qtab and i want to be able to drag-and-drop a qtablewidget which is within the qgraphicsscene onto a totally different widget - another qtablewidget which is much higher up in the window but not a parent

generaly qgraphicsscene better using with connection qgraphicsview


octal	decimal---------------------------------------------------

others
hex or maybe octal depending on the machine being emulated will be clearer than using decimal since similar opcodes tend to vary in bits not digits

this means the buffer is enough for printing the number in octal and since decimal representation uses no more digits than octal it will be enough for decimal representation too


base convenient constants
you ll need to convert binary to another base here i use decimal when writing this code because c doesn t have binary constants which would be ten times more useful than octal constants

bitshifts just go easier with hexadecimal than decimal and is often more convenient to read than octal

the conversion between binary and either octal or hex is even easier than decimal


grafana	metrics---------------------------------------------------

others
we do create lot of dashboards in grafana which are more or less combination of few metrics and dimensions but that s becoming challenge as we need to setup two processes one for rt and other for batch due to ttl limitation on real-time index 15 days ttl was finalised after considering es health in mind


microchip	avr---------------------------------------------------

others
as far as easy goes they are both equivalent in terms of difficulty both provide assembly and c except that the gnu toolchain for avr is more complex than microchip because it requires use of unix command line etc

microchip is more successful in industry and has better tools than avr


raft	paxos---------------------------------------------------

others
i couldn t understand why paxos is better for split-brain scenarios or other network failures than traditional bully algorithm because i can easily find out when quorum of nodes leave from the cluster without using raft


textarea	pre---------------------------------------------------

others
textarea has one more line than pre

also you can do this with textarea or better with pre html element


strcpy	memset---------------------------------------------------

others
memset behaves like strcpy but the difference is that memcpy copied the data as it is byte but strcpy copies the formatted string as well so takes more time than memcpy to execute


strings simpler macro
your macro with memset and memcpy was not any safer than strcpy

you could use memcpy memset for strings too but strcpy is simpler


charat	indexof---------------------------------------------------

others
i ve found that using a simple for-loop iterating over all elements in the string and comparing using charat performs faster than indexof or regex


division	modulo---------------------------------------------------

number better easy
programmers like to use this property to speed up programs because it s easy to chop off some number of bits but performing a modulo is much harder it s about as hard as doing a division

modulo gives you a remainder which is why it s better than straight division in situations where you re number of elements can change

implementing multiplication and division might be more costly than you would like but at least addition is easy modulo protecting against over underflow and you claim to not need any operations so even better

then you can process any length number using very few division remainder modulo operations which is important because they are much slower than addition


priority higher lower
taking the remainder of the division by 256 through the modulo effectively extracts the lower byte since the result will be 256 by definition

it appears that you consider modulo to have lower precedence than multiplication and division when in fact it does not

note parentheses are redundant as division and multiplication have the same priority and modulo has higher precedence over addition

is the same as because division has higher priority than modulo


point long branch
so in simple terms this should give you a feel for why division and hence modulo is slower computers still have to do long division in the same stepwise fashion tha you did in grade school

modulo is a bit weird for floating point - it returns negative for negative so you still have to have a branch and it involves a division which is slower on some machines as in i ve not found a machine where is significantly less expensive than going round a loop with a couple of subtractions two or three times


faster machine side
in this particular case you concluded that a bitwise-and operation of c++ language must be implemented by a bitwise-and machine operation while a modulo must somehow involve machine division which is allegedly slower

if you compute modulo a power of two using bitwise and is simpler and generally faster than performing division

division and a table lookup versus a square root on your machine using this modulo might be faster

i am a bit suspicious of the performance because modulo tends to use division which is slower than your subtraction operations

a side effect of many division routines is the modulo - so in few cases should division actually be faster than modulo

since bit wise operations can be done very fast and division operations are relatively slow this type of modulo is much faster than doing a division


others
using an extra variable to avoid the costly division and the resulting time was 18.9s so significantly better than the modulo with a statically known constant

modulo is more mathematical if you like while the remainder in the c-family is consistent with the common integer division satisfying and this is adopted from old fortran

python respects this definition whereas in most other programming language the modulo is really more like a reaminder after division operator

the first condition is if the modulo of the number and division is larger than 2 then return false

is a leftover after the division which corresponds to result of the modulo

in those cases the modulo will be negative and the result of integer division will be one more than you want

inverse modulo for 300 time take 1.422 seconde more than executing division sub and multiplication 10k time even the core of inverse modulo is build with same division and sub and multiplication functions and for this number it just do 150 time inside while help plz why

for instance if the high word is less than the modulo then it is safe to perform the division like this


email	dkim---------------------------------------------------

others

existence likely checks
4 some email providers might mark that email as spam however most spam checks are based on spf and dkim checks more than email existence checks

other advice is to ensure that you have done as much as possible to avoid being flagged as spam such as setup spf record and dkim and also read up on how to create email that are less likely to be treated as spam


memcpy	strncpy---------------------------------------------------

others
which is more efficient is up for debate but based on cpu bulk instructions which can copy an entire block of memory in one instruction memcpy is probably faster as strncpy would check each copied byte for a nul character

even if underlying implementation is not so different memcpy is much faster because it does not have to check what it s copying strncpy will stop when it ll copy the end of string character null

but for the example you give it doesn t matter - if it s going to fail it will be in the initial strlen so strncpy doesn t buy you anything in terms of safety and presumbly strncpy is slower as it has to both check bounds and for nul and any difference between memcpy and strcpy isn t worth changing code for speculatively

in this particular case it would just copy the 3 bytes as expected but why use strncpy when memcpy is a simpler solution

the memcpy version is not more complex or more dangerous than the strncpy version

if you compute the length of the string for unrelated reasons or have the length of the string from other resources it s unclear to me whether memcpy is better or worse than strncpy


slower world byte
memcpy can be faster than strcpy and strncpy because it does not have to compare each copied byte with 0 and because it already knows the length of the copied object

strncpy - memcpy is faster but you need to know the size of the input string

memcpy will always be faster than strncpy for any real world situation even in the corner case i spoke before look page_copy_fwd_maybe

memcpy is rarely slower than strcpy or strncpy and often significantly faster


websocket++	libwebsockets---------------------------------------------------

others
fastcgi++ is everything i could hope for for the ajax demands but it doesn t have websockets and i chose websocket++ over libwebsockets since websocket++ is more or less a simple #include so i assumed that i could incorporate it into fastcgi++


atomic	interlocked---------------------------------------------------

others
but consider this it s literally impossible to do any better than interlocked operations for cross-process communication with atomic updates and no locks are held


maven	buildr---------------------------------------------------

others
and even though everybody says ruby is slow buildr was 2-6x faster than maven

i read in a blog article that buildr a ruby based build tool was two times faster than maven for a simple build


qmainwindow	qwidget---------------------------------------------------

others
second you don t need a qmainwindow as top parent a qwidget give a better result

qmainwindow is basically same as qwidget when used as a guess what main window the noticeable difference is that qwidget expects you to have only 1 window in ur application while qmainwindow is more about serving as the most important window which will control all the rest like alert message boxes for example


id3v2	id3-tag---------------------------------------------------

others
i simply want to get the genre id3-tag of an mp3 file but the id3v2 utility returns more information than i require and i don t understand what this data represents


wav	opus---------------------------------------------------

others
it is even slower since i could only upload wav which is way bigger in size compared with ogg and opus


pdfbox	itext---------------------------------------------------

others
i explored itext and chose it over pdfbox it is perhaps 2-3 times faster than pdfbox and adding page is implicit and automatic

i have noticed that content extraction is faster in itext but searching words using regex in the content extracted by itext takes longer time than pdfbox

start with pdfbox as it s text extraction abilities are better than itext s

on the downside pdfbox is less mature than itext so it has less features and documentation available


couchbase	couchdb---------------------------------------------------

others
i d like to add that couchbase is a faster and more scalable option than couchdb the 2.0 version introduces views at a high level it s a distributed memcached membase server merged with couchdb but of course more sophisticated than just mashing them together

couchbase looks more like a memcache server with a persistence layer powered by couchdb and maybe it does not fit your needs

couchbase btw also uses binary replication mechanism which will be more efficient than couchdb as long as the couchdb protocol is not utilized for bidirectional data exchange and conflict resolution


kramdown	redcarpet---------------------------------------------------

others
not too easy extending redcarpet this way maybe kramdown is easier

also redcarpet and pygments were no longer available so they must be replaced by kramdown and rouge in _config.yaml


gtk	pygobject---------------------------------------------------

others
it looks like python-mpdor is using gtk 2 which would be pygtk as opposed to newer gtk 3 which is pygobject

to avoid this use pygobject build earlier than 2.90.1 if your gtk is old


imagemagick	graphicsmagick---------------------------------------------------

others
it would be somewhat easier with imagemagick than graphicsmagick as anthony thyssen has put together some excellent examples - but they rely on imagemagick capabilities such as aside-processing in parentheses which graphicsmagick lacks

i successfully compiled graphicsmagick with q8 but after all it seems about 30 slower than imagemagick 0.3 secs

i thought graphicsmagick was supposed to be leaner meaner than imagemagick

mmmm graphicsmagick is somewhat less developed than imagemagick in many respects

for a pdf that imagemagick was giving inaccurate colors i found that graphicsmagick did a better job

graphicsmagick provides more extensive api documentation than imagemagick

note that imagemagick is the most powerful exactimage is the fastest and graphicsmagick is a folk of imagemagick which is faster but a little less powerful and has some bugs


end s3 file
for me graphicsmagick is performing far better than imagemagick

graphicsmagick is a fork of imagemagick that is faster and has fewer bugs this is what flickr uses internally so it should be good enough for you

after trying both and finding that imagemagick was better but in the end i choose neither and went with graphicsmagick instead

graphicsmagick also seems to be faster than imagemagick using better multitasking

graphicsmagick converted much faster than imagemagick although i did not test conversion with cuda processing

the origin server would get the images from s3 process them using graphicsmagick since it s much faster than imagemagick then serve them

i do know imagemagick better than graphicsmagick

i keep hearing from some people that graphicsmagick a fork from quite a few years back that branched off from imagemagick is significantly faster than imagemagick

also changing your imagemagick install from a 16bit one to a 8bit may improve speed as i belive that is one reason graphicsmagick is faster

graphicsmagick is not that much faster -- and the outputted file sizes are significantly higher than imagemagick


accessor	ivar---------------------------------------------------

runtime situations significant
technically accessing the ivar directly is faster than using accessor but there are very few situations in which it will make a significant performance difference and would probably be a case of premature optimization

the accessor will be faster since you ll avoid all the slogging through the runtime to find the ivar in question


others
nonatomic properties don t use locks but direct ivar is faster because it skips the accessor call

there s not much to recommend one over the other except that the direct ivar access is slightly faster the properties version creates a temporary array and sends an accessor message to make the new condition create its copy of that array

if an ivar is going to be changed frequently declaring a properties and always using the accessor will make it easier to avoid memory management errors


integer	radix---------------------------------------------------

others
so when using radix sort make sure the longest integer is shorter than the array size or vice versa

if this is not the case a standard comparison-based sort algorithm or even an integer sorting algorithm like radix sort is asymptotically better


equal decimal value
integer.parseint takes string as a signed decimal integer and that integer must be less than and not equal radix value base

a radix search tree trie might be more suitable than a hash if you re mapping from string to integer


memcpy	realloc---------------------------------------------------

others
hunch a clever implementation of realloc should execute faster than a brute memcpy to a new array

as we can see copying manually with memcpy is always slower than realloc because in this scenario malloc is guaranteed to allocate new memory and you re forced to copy the data in every allocation which shows us that realloc is indeed reusing the same address and enlarging the block size in some cases

it wouldn t do a memcpy -- that s only necessary when the realloc size is larger and there s no room to expand

for example realloc may be allocating more memory than you actually request or allocating contiguous memory just after the end of the previous block so your code is doing more memcpy s than realloc

in the case of overflow a free malloc pair costs less than realloc because of its internal hidden memcpy


malloc memalloc tests
a realloc can occur significantly faster than a malloc memcpy and free

as you can see from the above tests realloc is consistently faster compared to memalloc memcpy and free


memcpy	malloc---------------------------------------------------

others
afaik malloc is not slower than memcpy

in the case of overflow a free malloc pair costs less than realloc because of its internal hidden memcpy

this allows you to use the assignment operator instead of memcpy and requires 1 less call to malloc - the one you make


loop-and-copy better copying
the function then allocates space to a new pointer with malloc and does a memcpy operation or loop-and-copy although memcpy is probably better

as we can see copying manually with memcpy is always slower than realloc because in this scenario malloc is guaranteed to allocate new memory and you re forced to copy the data in every allocation which shows us that realloc is indeed reusing the same address and enlarging the block size in some cases


perforce	cvs---------------------------------------------------

others
since perforce is less commonly used compared to cvs svn amongst bamboo users we generally get less feedback about it and hear less about existing issues


jsr168	jsr286---------------------------------------------------

others
the posts you see seem to be logical as jsr286 is a newer spec and there are some features that make jsr268 portlet not a jsr168 portlet

as the previous poster points out this would be easier with jsr286 portlets wef and non-wef as the eventing is standard but it s not impossible with jsr168 if you re limited to that version in the short term


carrierwave	paperclip---------------------------------------------------

others
carrierwave is a newer gem than paperclip and it looks a lot more flexible

carrierwave seems to be gaining more popularity than paperclip but most people seem to be on paperclip

seems like paperclip is more file oriented and carrierwave is more object oriented

new to carrierwave already loving it so much better than paperclip


dropbox	icloud---------------------------------------------------

others
instead of dropbox i could use key value store as rest web service which i want to do later but have no time for this for now in my opinion my solution is more reliable than icloud and which is very important i have full control on how itâ s working mainly because itâ s my own code


scikit-learn	nltk---------------------------------------------------

others
if you are worried about memory then do look into scikit-learn since equivalent models can use significantly less memory than nltk

or scikit-learn directly .for more details nltk 3.0 documentation

what you re looking for is linear regression and scikit-learn is much better than nltk for this see

if your in to python there is nltk as already mentioned by it s author but there is also scikit-learn which provides much more than just clustering

the nltk library includes a confusion matrix that is simple to use and produces a nicer output than scikit-learn


cvsnt	svn---------------------------------------------------

others
just a wild guess here but if you re using cvsnt on the server this observation might be based on the fact that cvsnt simply is much better at merging than svn because it has the notion of mergepoints


moq	moles---------------------------------------------------

others
personally i think moles is much better suited for mocking the unmockable and i prefer a combination of moq for my own interfaces and classes and moq for framework and externalities like file i o gui db connections etc

moles is more often compared contrasted to typemock in that it offers a set of facilities outside of moq and or rhinomocks sweet spot


fftw	gsl---------------------------------------------------

others
on the accuracy front this accuracy benchmark from fftw suggests that they have similar accuracy for most case with fftw being slightly more accurate but that gsl tend to exhibit accuracy degradation for real data and larger transform sizes

you can have a look at this speed performance benchmark from fftw which suggests that gsl is about 3-4 times slower than fftw 3

gsl can do fft s but fftw is better at doing that


matlabpool	parfor---------------------------------------------------

others
in general parfor with matlabpool is an easier combination to use than dfeval

also when you open a matlabpool the workers are launched and ready so the overhead of parfor is much less but still not zero as the body of the loop needs to be sent to the workers

if you want to batch and parfor at the same time open one less worker with matlabpool than you otherwise would


mezzanine	cartridge---------------------------------------------------

others
you requirements sound like mezzanine + cartridge would be a better solution for you


ftp	smb---------------------------------------------------

others
push log files to a central location ftp is faster than smb the windows ftp command can be automated with -s scriptfile


qfile	qdatastream---------------------------------------------------

others
a qfile may be used by itself or more conveniently with a qtextstream or qdatastream


getc	fputs---------------------------------------------------

others
using fgets and fputs is faster than multiple calls to getc and putc all you need is a buffer a little buffer in this case to store the current line


nsviewcontroller	nssplitview---------------------------------------------------

others
i ve tried a great deal of configuration changes i ve tried using an nssplitviewcontroller vs just dropping an nssplitview into an nsviewcontroller to adjust more parameters programmatically but i m not having any luck


ng-show	ng-class---------------------------------------------------

others
edit as mentioned by chandresh using the ng-show directive with a true false value would be a better option than using ng-class


mergesort	timsort---------------------------------------------------

others
however if the data is well scattered causing timsort to behave more like mergesort then binning first will possibly make for a slight win

timsort is used by python and java for their sort methods and is rather supernaturally fast but it s a more complex algorithm than mergesort which matters if you re working in something like c - so if you just need something that works pretty well and is simple go with mergesort

this means that while the two underlying sorts it uses mergesort and insertion sort are both worse than quicksort for many kinds of data timsort only uses them when it is advantageous to do so


casting	autoboxing---------------------------------------------------

others
is that casting from long to int plus sparsearray optimizations are going to be cheaper than autoboxing long to long for my hashmap operations


dplyr	rlang---------------------------------------------------

others
hadley wickham released a fundamentally new version of dplyr with a new underbelly called rlang which provides a more consistent framework for non-standard evaluation


ng-view	ng-include---------------------------------------------------

others
i could add the dropzone in a ng-include above the area and have it hidden when the template is looking elsewhere but have heard that ng-include uses more processor than ng-view so would prefer to keep it all together


debian	centos---------------------------------------------------

others
note that centos software versions are older than debian s but versions of opensuse software are newer than debian s versions

debian ubuntu and centos these are less of the lightweight base images each coming in around 50m give or take

we recently have migrated redmine from a server which was running under centos 5.5 with the same ror environment the same load the performance was a way better than on debian 7

he says he uses debian and is less familiar with centos and so i am posting here

i am more acquainted with debian than centos and i know the libraries i need are


gson	moshi---------------------------------------------------

others
if you re using retrofit and okhttp to perform the network calls i suggest you use moshi as it s also from square and claimed to work faster and better than gson


symfony	phalcon---------------------------------------------------

others
i am new to phalcon and coming from more of symfony background i just need to know how define optional relationship between foreign keys in phalcon models


coalesce	nullif---------------------------------------------------

others
since my solution with nullif had performance problems and your use of coalesce was much faster i wonder if you could try tweaking that solution to deal with the issue of -1


qsort	bsearch---------------------------------------------------

others
one of the reasons i argued so strongly above that bsearch would be faster is because it cheats relative to other associative data structures by doing the work of the sort via qsort up front


mri	rubinius---------------------------------------------------

choices web yarv
for longer-running applications like a web application rubinius or jruby will generally perform better than mri

works on some rubies better than others jruby and rubinius are recommended efficiency on mri is decreased due to gvl global vm lock

in practice this means that deploying a rails app to jruby is a good idea as is running your integration tests but for developer unit tests and scripts mri yarv or rubinius are better choices


others
something where the app is about serving different pages you want low memory and good context switching things like preforking unicorn or running on the rubinius version of ruby with puma that makes concurrency easier to code because it will perform well with threading as opposed to something like mri with a global interpreter lock


qmainwindow	qdialog---------------------------------------------------

others
i m creating a program which has a settings menu in the shape of another window this used to be a qmainwindow but i read that a qdialog would work better for this so i manually converted the qmainwindow into a qdialog window

if you re not using qmainwindow s docking area functionality a qdialog would be a more sensible base class to use


multiplying	addition---------------------------------------------------

operation boilerplate complex
the boilerplate code would multiplying rapidly when the express get more complex than addition of two terms

however multiplying is a more complex operation than addition or shifting


others
for instance to achieve addition you would scale the larger value to have the same exponent as the smaller one by multiplying it by 10 largerexp-smallerexp then adding the two values and rescaling

in the remote case those operations are not simplified assuming that there is a jit that maps the multiplication and add opcodes in a 1 1 relationship to their cpu instruction counterparts in most modern architectures all integer arithmetic operations usually take the same number of cycles so it will be faster multiplying once than add four times just checked it addition is still slightly faster than multiplication 1 clock vs 3 clocks so it still pays using a multiplication here

so the compiler can t make the optimization because it can t tell if you wanted the exact behavior where multiplying is better or the implemented behavior where the scale of sum affects the result of the addition

functionally a multiplying will always take more time than an add because it combines a true multiplying along with a true addition step

either way your example with the numeric expression would multiplying by 3 first because multiplication has higher precedence than addition or subtraction

if multiplying is slower than addition then case 2 is slightly slower than case 1

you can try x1 c1 and then x1 + c1 but i don t think the addition is much faster than multiplying on todays cpus

we don t actually multiplying it s slower than simple addition and as you can see we destroy temporary register t0 but don t touch s0 s1

since you want to do same thing couple times writing your multiplication num1 num2 function yourself with only addition and using that when multiplying would be much better choice

so we must show that a gradeschool multiplying circuit is o log n times deeper than an addition circuit

you didn t provide a full code sample that includes the surrounding loop presumably there is a surrounding loop so it is hard to answer definitively but the main problem i see is that the latency of the dependency chains of your fma code is considerably longer than your multiplying + addition code


tidekit	tidesdk---------------------------------------------------

here is the blog post about the comparison how tidekit would be better than tidesdk


xts	lubridate---------------------------------------------------

others
hence i conclude lubridate to be more practical here also because ggplot does not understand xts objects right away


playsound	mci---------------------------------------------------

others
window media player uses directshow which gives you better performance and greater flexibility than playsound under mci


momentjs	datejs---------------------------------------------------

t.j better
nowadays datejs is outdated and not maintained so use momentjs which is much better as pointed out by t.j

you should try momentjs i think its much better than datejs


others

qtcpsocket	qnetworkaccessmanager---------------------------------------------------

others
qnetworkaccessmanager is higher level than qhttp and qtcpsocket so they have abstracted away the sockets connection state


valgrind	memcheck---------------------------------------------------

others
by simple i mean setting up some compiler flags -wall doesn t show any errors or using such tools as valgrind used it with memcheck that didn t help much


actionscript	mxml---------------------------------------------------

better ide non-programmers
so yes it can be used with flash or rather pure actionscript but it is a little less convenient than with mxml where everything is set up by the framework because it takes more under the hood configuration to be able to run all the necessary parts for remoting

i would say pure actionscript is better for programming whether you use flash ide or flex ide is not that relevant and mxml is better for non-programmers to combine the components programmed in as


others
if you write your own reusable components then writing them in actionscript may sometimes give you a little more control but for non-reusable views mxml is much better

actionscript is quicker than mxml but for what you re going to do you re trading speed for convenience - mxml comes with all the different ui classes list scrollbars etc already there

i can see that my skeleton mxml module is slightly larger than my actionscript module 66kb vs

sometimes your mxml does not get you the itch of what you are looking and actionscript gives you more power

what s the deal i thought actionscript would be nicer than mxml


fuzzy	lemmatization---------------------------------------------------

others
lemmatization implies a broader scope of fuzzy word matching that is


pbkdf2	salt---------------------------------------------------

purpose slower method
you should add a salt and use a slower hashing method such as pbkdf2 and bcrypt

why do people suggest using key stretching algorithms like bcrypt pbkdf2 which take longer to calculate on purpose rather than using faster algorithms which are also secure like salt sha-256 or sha-512 and using a throttling mechanism to limit brute-force attacks


bit iteration byte
just use pbkdf2 to make your hash directly make a 64 bit 8 byte random salt use a higher iteration count 4000-10000

in django for example passwords are hash with pbkdf2 or bcrypt but session hash use a less complex hmac and no random salt


others
pbkdf2 is more secure than a simple hash or even a salt hash

as a side note from what i ve read key derivation functions pbkdf2 scrypt bcrypt are considered better more secure #1 #2 than plain salt sha-1 sha-2 hash by crypto people

a randomly salt one way hashing algorithm would be ideal and sha1 and above should be fine though pbkdf2 would be better

although because pbkdf2 applies your hash function a large number of times a long salt is less important than in traditional straight hashing applications. for my application i use a 32 byte random salt unique for each users account where i m hashing their password with pbkdf2

it should be in my opinion more strongly noted that password hashing with salt is no longer secure and should not be used as others noted use pbkdf2 or bcrypt


printf	strcpy---------------------------------------------------

others
at first glance it must be significantly faster because strcpy must be significantly faster than printf

either the strcpy or the printf function is more appropriate

the above printf should work although strcpy would make more sense for that purpose


ubuntu	debian---------------------------------------------------

others
both use debian packages and ubuntu is based on debian but is more user friendly

recompiling ubuntu kernels is harder -- it will require working with debian build tools

i have installed these two tools with the official package of ubuntu and also with the package of debian that seems more updated

since ubuntu 10.10 is newer than debian squeeze if you can do it on squeeze you can certainly do it on ubuntu

ubuntu is far less conservative than debian so you will get closer to the bleeding edge

i believe ubuntu is smaller debian wheezy smaller still or even alpine for tiny start point

the main advantage of the debian image is the smaller size â it clocks in at around 85.1 mb compared to around 200 mb for ubuntu

this is because ubuntu 15.10 uses a newer version of libc and libstdc++ which is not available on debian 8

i m in debian wheezy which is much more recent than ubuntu 10.04

on my debian should be more or less the same on any debian based distro like ubuntu

ubuntu has nicer frontend and could be more suitable for windows emigrants while debian is more for backend guys

ubuntu heavily relies on python scripting and generally consumes more resources than debian


better stable team
but if your team has ubuntu experience maybe debian would be better choice for server infrastructure if you do not need the bleeding edge set of applications

as for debian being more stable than ubuntu for using as server it can be true in very rare occasions where the package is very obscure


recvfrom	datagram---------------------------------------------------

others
the datagram is larger than your buffer so it gets trucated you get an error return from recvfrom and getlasterror returns 10040 wsaemsgsize

wsaemsgsize usually means that the buffer you provided to recvfrom was smaller than the incoming datagram


abc	isinstance---------------------------------------------------

others
the fact that checking with isinstance the membership in a concrete type is not so good while checking the membership in an abc is more often useful lies in a principle that the gang of 4 expressed clearly and intensely in the first part of their wonderful book design patterns in a mostly c++ context but it really applies much more widely than that


atoi	strcmp---------------------------------------------------

others
once you ve done that you can use strcmp to see if the string is equal to stop and if not then call atoi or better yet strtol which has better error checking to get the numerical value


crypt	hash---------------------------------------------------

others
the second hashing function is hash which supports many more algorithms and variants than crypt but does not support some algorithms that crypt does

that accepts either nothing a salt or a hash that crypt made earlier which has the salt to make the hash embedded in it

crypt with hash is simply more expensive than md5

mac os x llvm gcc based crypt fuction is borked junk hardwired to only use des a proven breakable hash worse than md5

so when i see that the salt is stored in the hash password and that you use that hash password as salt i think crypt + salt is not more secure against a brute force on output hackers who managed to steal hash passwords

hash is newer and seems to support more hashing alogrithms than crypt


recoverable addition unrecoverable
my sense is that encode and decode are probably good solutions when you want the data to be recoverable but that unrecoverable hash using crypt md5 is a better approach for stored passwords

in addition using crypt to hash password is better


boost	stl---------------------------------------------------

exceptions better mfc
once you re past the basics with c++ learning how to use parts of stl and then how it works will be better than tackling boost

.net library support is way better and cleaner than stl mfc and boost

c++ s stl is getting better and better yet it s not nearly as huge as boost and is not intended to

maybe this would have all been better with boost but i m still learning stl and didn t go that way

i ve used both for the same project boost is better integrated with the stl and especially c++ exceptions


others
i don t want to use boost because that s a library i haven t used extensively yet and i m doing this partly as an exercise to gain greater mastery over the stl

boost s io stream might be a better solution than stl s own stream

i am a c++ programmer and over the years have been subjected to hearing the notion that stl is not good for use in embedded environments and hence usually prohibited in usage for embedded environment based projects.i believe stl libraries like boost are far more powerful and provide a much more faster less error prone means of development ofcourse the syntax is little intimidating but once past that i think it s a real treasure .also i find the claims that stl is heavy and increases final footprint of code absurd because since it is templatized one is only going to get compilable code which he asked for and not the entire stl

the boost pool library provides stl allocator that are more efficient when allocator objects of the same type as opposed to std allocator which simply uses new and delete

while boost is more modern c++ it also harder to use for non trivial tasks - and without a modern c++ experience and deep stl knowledge it is difficult to use correctly

for example using classes and class methods and function overloading which are usually easy for even c diehards to cope with but not the stl stream operators and boost which are harder to learn and can have bad memory characteristics

too bad that find calls often end up verbose â it s even worse with stl than with boost ranges


template www.boost.org libraries
boost libraries are generally less mature and less standard than stl

as for not reinventing the wheel like many have said already make sure to first explore the possibilities in the standard template library stl which is much richer than you might think and then look at boost www.boost.org which has libraries for a lot of diverse purposes and they are extremely high quality and some are just works of art like spirit proto lambda and mpl


trie	dawg---------------------------------------------------

waste efficiency space
it combines efficiency of a trie trie can be seen as a special case of dawg but is much more space efficient

use a dawg which is more efficient than a trie in terms of space waste


others
a dawg has better memory performance if the strings have many common suffixes but they are more expensive and difficult to build and update so start with a trie

a dawg is ideal but a trie is simpler and a decent starting point

using a dawg could save you more space as compared to a trie

however that space overhead can be reduced by compressing the trie using the patricia tree representation using a more efficient data structure to store child pointers or building a dawg from the trie

it is a structure similar to but twice as space-efficient as the dawg that is more efficient than the trie which only compresses prefixes

if you have a large number of items in your ignore list and need to lookup the list often it would make more sense to put your ignored items in a trie or a radix trie or a dawg these are more or less the same thing


memory structure values
i would suggest that given your desire to also search through the stored string values you should consider whether either a trie structure such as a patricia trie or for even better memory amortisation a directed acyclic word graph refered to affctionalty as a dawg would work better

if you re interested there is another data structure called a dawg directed acyclic word graph that is similar to the trie but uses substantially less memory


uilabel	uibutton---------------------------------------------------

others
the uilabel text is shown correctly but the uibutton title update is slower

an uilabel could be used kind of showing a link but an uibutton might be more appropriate

the problem i am having is when the test of the uilabel gets longer after pressing a uibutton - read more in the cell itself

my solution is i create a uibutton name read more at bottom-right and below the uilabel

if the uilabel is larger it will then wrap around the uibutton to the next line

secondviewcontroller which is a subclass of firstviewcontroller also has a uilabel but has one more uibutton


richfaces	trinidad---------------------------------------------------

others
regarding skinning i feel trinidad default skinning to be more basic than richfaces one but i think both have ways to make them as beautiful as your css skills allow you

i think richfaces has a more mature ajax integration and their ajax components and events are more easy to use for me than trinidad ones


haskell	sml---------------------------------------------------

others
i haven t read the paper on edison but if it s nothing more than the haskell implementation of purely functional data structures doesn t it make more sense to port the sml code that s in the book thesis

because sml is eagerly evaluated the execution model is far easier to comprehend and debugging via printf works a lot better than in haskell

also sml has stricter precedence rules than haskell


wtforms	formencode---------------------------------------------------

others
i also recommend wtforms it s much easier to use than formencode and have builtin sqlalchemy extensions


profiler	btrace---------------------------------------------------

others
in my experience btrace overhead is far less noticeable than any profiler depending on activity of course - if you want to trace execution of all methods this will be expensive no matter what


documentfilter	jtextcomponent---------------------------------------------------

others
for listening changes into jtextcomponent is there documentlistener if you have to need control over inputed char sings whitespace chars or word s you have to implements documentfilter


glut	fltk---------------------------------------------------

others
fltk is really a full-blown gui toolkit though rather small as gui toolkits go that has a built-in glut emulation that at least the last time i played with it seemed considerably better implemented than glut itself


mongodb	bson---------------------------------------------------

format storage types
the distinction between int64 and int32 in mongodb is more about bson storage size

mongodb s server-side document representation is a json-like binary format called bson which has richer types than javascript json and preserves field order

the bson storage format used by mongodb supports more native types than javascript including 32-bit and 64-bit integers

i generally use mongodb because it returns queries in json format integrates well with angular.js and its bson format is much faster than json


levels nesting documents
mongodb supports no more than 100 levels of nesting for bson

basically mongodb supports no more than 100 levels of nesting for bson documents

mongodb supports no more than 100 levels of nesting for bson document.

mongodb supports no more than 100 levels of nesting for bson documents


others
if your requirement is to store a key with value as json then mongodb is a better fit in this scenario as by default mongodb stores data in bson which is json + additional data types

the bson becomes even more annoying to work with when exporting data from mongo to another db platform this is the case when dealing with big data that is collected and you want to merge it with some properties from the back office mongodb this means a lot of pain you need to transform the binary objectid to a string in order to join with the id in different platforms that do not use bson representation

how to encode 12-byte bson string of mongodb s objectid to shorter form

mongodb stores everything in memory anyway and works in a similar vein being a key-value based system however i believe mongodb is more flexible as it allows for storing bson objects within themselves


mb larger limit
note that json representation of mongodb document could exceed this limit since bson is more compact

gridfs is not a server-side feature but rather a convention on how files larger than the bson document size limit of 16 mb can be stored in mongodb

so if your document bson is larger than 16 mb mongodb throws exception

a document in mongodb is more or less like a json structure bson to be specific

yes mongodb persists data as json or bson to be more precise but you don t have do deal with it

mongodb must be smaller than the maximum bson document size


slider	fotorama---------------------------------------------------

others
call to instagram on success of which you call fotogram to initialize your slider but the problem is that since you re loading many images fotorama initialization gets run more than once on each success .after first initialization any further attempt would only mess up the slider.note that if you put it outside 2 foreach that wouldn t work either because at this point even the first request would be in pending state


nsscanner	nsstring---------------------------------------------------

others
use the floatvalue nsstring method or a nsscanner which is more powerful and flexible

of course you might be able to make the first step from long string to number easier by using nsscanner or by taking a substring of your long string cutting out everything except for the number itself and then using the nsstring method integervalue or doublevalue


ivar	subclassing---------------------------------------------------

others
if i have a class hierarchy in which subclassing require use of more specific types than those specified in the superclass ivars is it better to declare the superclass ivar as id or to type it and then cast where necessary in the subclassing


git-rebase	undo---------------------------------------------------

others
what i d like to do now is undo the git-rebase and redo it more thoughtfully


qtkit	quicktime---------------------------------------------------

others
you can do it with qtkit but works better in 32bit quicktime framework


qtoolbutton	qpushbutton---------------------------------------------------

others
qtoolbutton is much more complex under the hood than qpushbutton

qtoolbutton has smaller default internal margins than qpushbutton


qtreewidget	qtreeview---------------------------------------------------

others
if your exchange data between 2 widget i suggest to use qtreewidget more than qtreeview because data in qtreewidget can edit dynamic data row and value


suggestion issue use
and one more suggestion instead of using qtreewidget i think qtreeview is a better choice if you can explain the issue a bit more maybe i can provide some sample code

or isn t qtreewidget purposed for this use and a qtreeview would serve better


scikit-learn	liblinear---------------------------------------------------

others
also linearsvc class from scikit-learn performs even better than liblinear whch is also surprising considering that it s a wrapper of liblinear

you can also try sklearn.linear_model.logisticregression and sklearn.svm.linearsvc both implemented using liblinear that is more scalable than libsvm albeit less memory efficients than other linear models in scikit-learn


excon	eventmachine---------------------------------------------------

others
if you re using faraday and start out with net http you can later decide to use excon typhoeus patron or eventmachine without changing more than a line or two of configuration


cypher	gremlin---------------------------------------------------

others
neo4j and cypher is still faster and obviously this has no effect on the gremlin queries on neo4j but that might be just a issue with the gremlin implementation for neo4j

in this case a traversal-oriented approach is best maybe gremlin is better since cypher doesn t allow you to specify traversal order

but i read in this post that group by on union are not possible yet it mean that cypher is less powerful than gremlin

translating this to gremlin is a tad bit tedious pattern matching in cypher is more natural but lmk if this is in the right direction and i ll do it

cypher seems much more clear to me than gremlin and in general it seems that the guys in neo4j are going with cypher

recently we noticed that cypher queries run faster than gremlin so we decided to convert our queries


uninstall	upgrade---------------------------------------------------

new reinstall old
the old upgrade was more an uninstall and a reinstall

the upgrade works correctly but if uninstall new build for example build 9 and install an old one example 3 i got an error although nothing currently installed on my machine this versioning is older than installed one


others
for example if you tried that and it only installed newer files with higher versioning then your major upgrade logic is incorrect by definition because that will uninstall the older product before installing the newer one

one thing before the problem the upgrade from one wix packaged sw to another wix packaged sw is actually working fine i am able to uninstall the older versioning and install the newer versioning

then i tryed following changing upgrade code of product - and make high versioning again then uninstall and install lower versioning - and it worked fine

i did it an upgrade test on a dummy machine and when i get to the real thing i had to uninstall and remove all leftover db s tfs_configuration you can see migrate data from tfs 2008 to an already working tfs 2012


pkcs#5	cryptojs---------------------------------------------------

others
regarding the padding itâ s more tricky as cryptojs does not list pkcs#5 as supported and java does not list pkcs7 in fact it lists very little so it might be implementation depended which padding algorithms the aes provider supports but at least nopadding is supported by both java and cryptojs


scala	typesafe---------------------------------------------------

others
scala does not provide an alternative and any alternative that was provided would likely be less reliable as typesafe does not have the resources that sun oracle ibm etc


codeigniter	cakephp---------------------------------------------------

others
in my opinion it will probably be easier to integrate with codeigniter although someone more experienced with cakephp might prove me wrong

i personally use codeigniter which probably falls in to the heavy framework category but is at least much lighter than cakephp and lighter than zend too i think

cakephp is very hip zendframework is widely used although more of a all-purpose component library yet i personally believe symfony flow3 and codeigniter to be more favourable

i suspect codeigniter doesn t have quite as flexible a structure it s smaller and lighter than cakephp but a quick look at the cakephp manual to see how behaviors components helpers and the vendors folder may be helpful

cakephp is considered slower than codeigniter but you can tweak it to enhance speed

i have been reading about cakephp but it seems a bit more complicated than codeigniter

cakephp is newer more feature rich and heavier than codeigniter codeigniter is designed to have a much smaller footprint so you will most likely find yourself creating functionality in codeigniter to match cake s

in my view cakephp seems much more lighter then codeigniter but i never used either one so i can t judge

why do people say cakephp is somewhat harder than codeigniter for people new to mvc

i am currently looking at yii and while its more complex than codeigniter the documentation is much more informative and therefore understandable than cakephp s


yii libraries lower
codeigniter has the lower learning curve overall so i would recommend it over cakephp

if you employ php frameworks like codeigniter yii maybe even cakephp which have comparatively smaller learning curves you will find your path wellpaved for you in php

depending on how much you used cakephp you may need to realize that frameworks other than codeigniter often have more libraries and auto-generating funcionality is that the right word


atof	strtod---------------------------------------------------

position job starynkevitch
you can actually switch to strtod always a much better idea than atof and ask it to give you the character position that caused it to stop parsing

edit basile starynkevitch mentions that strtod is better than atof for this job as it gives the ending character


others
the second form is recommended for newer code as atof is deprecated in favor of strtod .

it would be better to use strtod for this purpose as it allows for error-checking but atof is simpler to use and so is used here

note atof and similar functions don t detect overflows and return zero on error so there s no way to know if it failed not sure if it sets errno see also keith s comments about undefined behaviour for certain values so the point is you should use strtol for converting from strings to int and strtod for converting to double those have much better error handling

atof may be faster than strtod on one platform and slower on another


multiplying	division---------------------------------------------------

divinding quaternion decimal
i believe that division would be faster than multiplying by the inverse since the inverse has to be calculated first then multiplication performed

division of quaternion a by quaternion b is nothing more than multiplying a by the multiplicative inverse of b

according to agner s instruction tables a single fp division is slower than a single reciprocal op and a single multiplying op

i presume that you know that using a division is a lot slower than multiplying by decimal number 5 is always slower than 0.2

my question i would rather not use the multiplying operator as multiplicative division operators are slower to execute on my target

these can be compared to multiplying by 2 x left-shift or divinding by 2 x right-shift but it should be noted that a binary shift is much faster than a division operation


note performance dshin
note that i ve incorporated dshin s comment that multiplying is faster than division however the performance improvement is about 90 removing the binary search 10 multiplication vs

sure that s probably compiled or jit d away but you should avoid division in performance critical code it s far slower than multiplying


others
but in normal case it takes n 2 comparison so you half the height of tree but you multiplying each merge with two so total running time is not better than division to 2 part

in usual programming practice one wouldn t bother and simply multiplying by the floating-point representation of 180 ï because multiplication is so much faster than division

while working with integer division it s better to multiplying first and divide later to minimize the rounding error

multiplication and division are much more complicated and the compiler usually produces some small helper functions to deal with these whenever you multiplying 64-bit numbers together

perhaps it s the case that division is much more accurate than reciprocal plus multiplying

to improve on the multiplying by this irrational number notice how the division routine gave lots more precision didnt need to be that extreme assuming 16 bit numbers using 32 bit math operations

in a 64 bit application this code will be a lot faster than in a 32 bit application in a 32 bit application multiplying two 64 bit numbers take 3 multiplication and 3 additions on 32 bit values - however it might be still faster than a division on a 32 bit machine

but determining the digit and the carry by division is much more concise and for the larger factors also much more efficient when multiplying a digit by 100 the result is on average 450 requiring 45 subtractions but two divisions are sufficient for all factors

division typically uses more resources.â to avoid division we multiplying rather than divide

division is much harder to calculate with subtractions can t go too far find remainder - if a float then calculate fraction from remainder which in itself is oodles of add multiplying and subtract

i read about python following pemdas that is precedence of multiplying is more than division


appkit	nsapplication---------------------------------------------------

others
the documentation for deactivate method for nsapplication says that i shouldn t call this method directly since appkit knows better how to deactivate stuff


springsource	grails---------------------------------------------------

others
the community is smaller than grails but the project is supported by springsource who is quite active in the community

division	addition---------------------------------------------------

others
division is performed by repeated subtraction therefore needs more level of subtract logic making division slower than addition

and division has larger complexity than addition

an addition is faster than a division and a multiplication

so if your code has tough data dependency problems addition is about 12 times faster than division

notice that by making the rule for contain the rule for this grammar makes sure all multiplication division operations occur lower in the parse tree than any addition subtraction

on simple low-cost processors typically bitwise operations are substantially faster than division several times faster than multiplication and sometimes significantly faster than addition

division has higher precedence than addition

the addition is much cheaper than other operations like modulo and division and array access

for example an addition is typically much faster than a division

if you are doing physical simulations things like division or square roots are going to be way more expensive than addition

the division has higher precedence than the addition so what you re calculating is sumaverage1+ sumaverage2 5 which is integer division which is probably not what you want

the division operator has a higher precendence than the addition operator so your function is calculating 1 1 + e -x

for example on most 32 bit systems 64-bit addition is faster than 32-bit division modulo

for floating point operations addition and subtraction are harder than multiplication and division so they may be slower or not again it depends on how much transistor real estate there is dedicated to the fpu

for that matter 64-bit addition might be faster than 32-bit addition and 32-bit division faster than 64-bit division

this happens because the division operator has higher precedence than the + addition operator

multiplication and division are higher precedence than addition so they get done first - before the implicit conversion to string for concatenation

you could also have dispatched a 1d grid and wrapped it to a 2d grid yourself but using a 2d thread position can save you an expensive integer division in the kernel in addition to being more intuitive

the first difference is that division is much more expensive than addition

it is true that division and modulo a division operation is slower than addition

so even disregarding that division is more expensive than addition and multiplication we see that the number of operations the sieve requires is much smaller than the number of operations required by trial division if the limit is not too small

division has a higher precedence than addition ergo

since division has a higher precedence than addition 5 2 gets evaluated as a integer division returning 2 as an integer

for e.g if i do an addition vs division in a loop will the calculation time for addition be less than that for division

the division operator has a higher precedence than the addition operator + so you need to enclose the sum with brackets before dividing

i need to find out that how much division operation is faster than addition operation in a gpu

performing addition on this slightly larger type will pretty much always be faster than doing division or modulo on the type itself

note parentheses are redundant as division and multiplication have the same priority and modulo has higher precedence over addition

knuth writes that fibonacci search is preferable on some computers because it involves only addition and subtraction not division by 2. but almost all computers use binary arithmetic in which division by 2 is simpler than addition and subtraction

division has worse latency than multiplication or addition by a factor of 2 to 4 on modern x86 cpus and worse throughput by a factor of 6 to 40

2.the division by 2 can be done by bit - shift operation is it really slower than addition

in addition to that the crossing off may be less work than a division don t know about python it is for c arrays

as far as i know the division is more complex and slower than other operations like addition so is my code incorrect then

the division operator has a higher order precedence as the addition operator

division and multiplication have higher precedence than addition so what this is actually doing is

the addition and subtraction is okay because the types of a and b force them to be performed using floating point arithmetic - but because division binds more tightly than addition and subtraction it s like using the brackets above only the immediate operands are considered

put each token +- of final command string in a list maybe a binary tree works and sort that list to tell the calculator that division and multiplication has the highest priority in the mean time addition and subtraction has lower priority

this means the work is sequential addition not multiplication not division which are much more expensive

note that division has a higher precedence than addition

then you can process any length number using very few division remainder modulo operations which is important because they are much slower than addition

but that s not the case here since division and multiplication have higher precedence than addition and there are no parentheses involved

division and modulo are indeed costly hardware operations whatever you do this is more related to hardware architecture than to languages or compilers perhaps ten times slower than addition

with careful optimization however you can make addition 61 times faster than division

however if the result a is added to or subtract from another expression and not reused then starting with the division may be more interesting since you can group the multiplication with the following addition by using a fma thus with a single rounding

you should expect a division to be a bit more expensive than a multiplication and a multiplication to be lot more expensive than an addition

also addition is faster than multiplication and multiplication is faster than division

it could be done via division which is much slower than addition or it could be translated into a bitwise and operation as well and end up being just as fast as the version

division has a higher precedence than addition or subtraction so it s really this

i think it is a few cycles slower than addition but yes division is very slow compared to the others

generally the division is more costly than addition i think but not much difference in this case


cycles example time
i remember it says something like division takes much much more time than addition

best example the division it an an addition are both o 1 but usually the division takes far more cycles time to execute than the addition


greater return integer
i found it fairly easy to generate addition subtraction and multiplication questions at random however division is more tricky

finally we all know that multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction so we can remove the extraneous parentheses so this turns into

the addition and subtraction are much more than multiplication and division

i know the basics division and multiplication higher than addition and subtraction but i would have to look up something more esoteric

multiplication division and modulo have the same precedence and they all have higher precedence than addition and subtraction

the intuition would say addition subtraction are faster than multiplication division but is that really correct

it is also possible to manipulate the inputs so that various parts of the calculation return 0 for addition or subtraction or 1 for multiplication or division to make testing easier but this only gets me so far

i don t understand why the division multiplication in c++ is so much slower than addition subtraction where the managed c# version is more reasonable to my expectations

division multiplication has higher precedence than addition subtraction and parentheses is required to do addition subtraction before multiplication division

typically operations like addition and subtraction are much faster in integer -- multiplication and division less so

multiplication and division operators have higher precedence than addition and subtraction in c++ same as in scientific notation

multiplication and division have higher priority than addition and subtraction

multiplication and division have a higher precedence than addition and subtraction

this is happening because the concatenation operator has a higher precedence than the addition or subtraction operators but multiplication and division have a higher precedence then concatenation

multiplication is more expensive than addition subtraction and division is more expensive still

apart from that multiplication is addition done more than once and division is subtraction done more than once

i don t think they have a natural precedence unlike say multiplication and division being of greater precedence than subtraction and addition because they can be built from subtraction and addition

in general you ll have more variation with multiplication and division than with addition and subtraction

integer multiplication division and modulo are much slower than integer addition and subtraction

to start with i need multiplication and division to take higher precedence than addition and subtraction

nothing follows the rule of multiplication and division having more precedence over addition and subtraction

implementing multiplication and division might be more costly than you would like but at least addition is easy modulo protecting against over underflow and you claim to not need any operations so even better

the term is apparently not an exact measurement as it is clear that a double-precision floating-point operation is going to take longer than a single-precision one and multiplication and division are going to take longer than addition and subtraction

the operations are always algebraically simple never involving anything more than addition multiplication subtraction division and taking powers

it will be much slower i don t have benchmarks but i would guess at least an order of magnitude maybe more decimal will not benefit from any hardware acceleration and arithmetic on it will require relatively expensive multiplication division by powers of 10 which is far more expensive than multiplication and dividion by powers of 2 to match the exponent before addition subtraction and to bring the exponent back into range after multiplication division


d3.js	rickshaw---------------------------------------------------

others
rickshaw is a graph library focused on time series whereas d3.js is more of a framework so it gives you much more functionality


passenger	webrick---------------------------------------------------

others

tiny good thin
phusion passenger is the de facto apache mod and yes it s better than webrick which is really only good for tiny sites or testing

in production it is much better to use a more sophisticated server like phusion passenger or unicorn since they have better performance than thin mongrel or webrick


tablet	mdpi---------------------------------------------------

density images android
owing to the fact that the screens density on the tablet is smaller android therefore uses the images in the mdpi folder for the tablet and the slightly bigger ones in the hdpi folder for the phone

the reason those two really high resolutions exist in mdpi is because they are only used on tablet which have a larger screens size...so the dpi rating works out to still be in the midrange


others
i ve tested this on a few devices a nexus 10 tablet which gets the bigger version of the file from the xhdpi folder a generic tablet using mdpi a galaxy ace phone mdpi again and everything works ok

and in my analysis the tablet must be more than 7 inches xlarge starting at mdpi


gruntjs	yeoman---------------------------------------------------

others
all this will be much easier with yeoman 1.0 which will be more customizable and will let you use whatever gruntjs tasks you want


fgets	ftell---------------------------------------------------

others
reading lines from the input file with fgets would be more reliable than your current method you cannot reliably compute the file size with ftell


typhoeus	eventmachine---------------------------------------------------

others
if you re using faraday and start out with net http you can later decide to use excon typhoeus patron or eventmachine without changing more than a line or two of configuration


emma	jacoco---------------------------------------------------

others
the reports from jacoco also look nicer than the ones in emma


strlen	strstr---------------------------------------------------

others
the problem turned out to be a loop in strstr which used strlen more or less as shown above


restkit	asihttprequest---------------------------------------------------

others
i have been using asihttprequest but it seems to be deprecated and i read that restkit is the newer library


nsdateformatter	nscalendar---------------------------------------------------

others
don t use nsdateformatter use nscalendar which is much more accurate


opentype	woff---------------------------------------------------

others

better raw fonts
truetype opentype font that provides better compression than woff 1.0

woff is compressed - smaller download sizes compared with raw truetype or opentype fonts


profiling	debugging---------------------------------------------------

others
of course you can only debugging the code to see the generated sql but it s easier with a profiling tool and you ll see how long time the query takes

note that this usually happens under the release profiling which is more strict by default about errors than say debugging

the reason is that maybe like in my case the xcode bot was attempting to archive with the development profiling and development profiling is much easier to debugging than 4f96f173-7ebe-4892-b283-52489de2f409

now the provisional profiling need to be tagged to even device for debugging which was earlier sufficient to just list the device uuid in store certificates and profiling section

nevertheless various profiling callgrind tool in valgrind cpu profiling google-perfutils and perf doesn t find those debugging symbols resulting in more or less useless output

corecompile input file c buildagent temp buildtmp.netframework version v4.0 profiling client.assemblyattributes.cs is newer than output file bin debugging dllname.xml

another thing to try is the excellent entity framework profiling - has saved us many headaches in debugging performance issues like these - gives you a lot more than sql profiling and you can see what queries objects are created per objectcontext and method source line etc -

this performance difference issue when doing profiling is better than debugging also has troubled me for a few hours i even tried to move code from web api to console application to test and console application has similar performance as good as when profiling web api


better faster micro-benchmarks
edit i guess release is much faster than debugging but why is this profiling so time consuming

time spent learning a profiling is probably better spent than time writing and debugging micro-benchmarks


profiling	benchmarking---------------------------------------------------

others
as svick said it s no better way than profiling your program identifying hot spots and optimizing them using concrete benchmarking

using a profiling is often more appropriate than benchmarking but it seems to be even more tricky

the issue is that the execution time of a benchmarking is much higher about 3 times in case i do not invoke the profiling along with it than the case when the benchmarking is executing with the profiling

minitest has much more than most people know for example minitest spec has bdd matchers akin to rspec minitest mock is a mocking system and minitest benchmarking is for performance profiling

to get a more reliable timing of the query you d need to use profiling or some other way of benchmarking that works more directly with the query


northwind	adventureworks---------------------------------------------------

others
talk about sql server 2005 adventureworks is better than northwind


vbo	normals---------------------------------------------------

others
g_vertex_buffer_data and g_color_buffer_data are the arrays of data to use you will likely need to set up some shader code and the render code still has to be added but this is how to have more than one vbo texture coords colours normals etc

when using interleaved vbo s the normals routine is that the same vertices and normals will be written more than once right

when i use vertex array model looks perfect but when i switch to vbo model looks worse because of vertex normals


typedef	struct---------------------------------------------------

others
many people who use the symbol defined by the typedef feel it more natural because often they come from other languages c++ c# ... where there s no need for the struct thing

you already typedef the pcb_q no need to use struct keyword any more

one camp most notably the linux kernel people thinks that struct a is clearer than the typedef

if you re using typedef you no longer need to write struct all over the place by useing typedef code is more cleaner since it provides a smidgen more abstraction

looking at what they have the struct holds and int and it holds an array that should be populated with the f_string typedef they defined earlier

you can verify with a simple objdump symbols objfile.obj that the length of decorated symbols by using typedef s is incredibly longer than their similar counterparts split into struct s microsoft compilers have historically used a proprietary name mangling scheme

i usually typedef my struct to make it more readable

also i think typedef is a better choice when you want to define a struct

the list is composed of link struct to be more precise it appears the link type is typedef d to be a pointer to the actual node struct

c++ allows you to define struct without the struct keyword so the typedef is used less often

having typedef s internal to the struct gives me better encapsulation since i only need to pass a single template parameter the dataset class rather than individually specifying the dataset plus t r .

this is a good example of a time to know the basics - i think understanding the ins and outs of struct is more helpful than typedef since you can do so much more with it

following the linux kernel coding gudelines i don t fancy typedef because they tend to make the data definitions opaque if something is declared elsewhere as the typedefined type understanding that is a struct is somewhat more complicated


file little life
i changed the bitmap header file a little to typedef the struct and make life easier at least for me

struct foo is easier to parse then typedef d foo as the name-lookup is simpler


cat	tee---------------------------------------------------

others
tee then writes more data t and tries to read from the pipe then goes to sleep until cat writes more data


rdf	owl---------------------------------------------------

others
owl is richer than languages such as rdf schema rdfs

owl provides more mechanisms for asserting shapes of rdf graphs as does new work on rdf shapes

owl has more structure than rdf

owl is a more advanced language than rdf


feof	fgetc---------------------------------------------------

others
you should call feof or ferror to determine why fgetc is returning no more data

you could instead check say with if feof stream to see if you are at eof but i think just checking the return value of fgetc is nicer


jgrowl	qtip---------------------------------------------------

others
craig wrote the removedata is just a hack to allow more than one qtip to be bound to a single element at any one time hence allowing multiple jgrowl s


migrate	downgrade---------------------------------------------------

others
if you overwrite the env versioning the rake db migrate will go downgrade rather than upgrade if versioning is smaller than last known versioning in db schema so please check and avoid similar environment variable


strcpy	strncpy---------------------------------------------------

safer alternative overflows
using strncpy instead of strcpy is normally safer but here you alloc eachtime the right amount of memory needed to store inpoint into mpoint so i cant see what s the point

i was exploring around with c regarding strncpy since most people says that it is safer than strcpy additional parameter length to avoid buffer overflows

strcpy is notoriously unsafe as are it s cousins strcpy_s and strncpy although they are mildly safer than strcpy

concerning the problem your printpiglatin could use the existing function strcpy or better strncpy which is safer in regards to buffer overflows

replaced strcpy with strncpy which is much safer apparently and that removed the segmentation fault

strncpy is safer than strcpy

strncpy is not safer than strcpy it just trades one type of bugs with another

in general strncpy is a safer alternative to strcpy

myth 3 strncpy is a safer version of strcpy

strncpy is not safer method to use as strcpy


switch simpler checking
using strncpy 3 is better than strcpy 3 but things like strlcpy 3 are better still

switch from using strcpy to strncpy or strncat which i think is better than strncpy

to copy a string in c use carefully strcpy 3 often strncpy is better

i.e strncpy is actually better than the simpler strcpy if you are willing to improve the code

strcpy could be better replaced by strncpy which does some bound checking


others
the best solution is to write a custom version of strncpy that is less weird or if you know the length of the input just use strcpy

using strncpy is considered safier than strcpy because the second one can easily cause buffer overrun

for instance strncpy is mostly useless it gives you nothing more than strcpy

so that the strncpy is more secure than strcpy

strncpy is more recommended that strcpy because protect your code against buffer overflow

but for the example you give it doesn t matter - if it s going to fail it will be in the initial strlen so strncpy doesn t buy you anything in terms of safety and presumbly strncpy is slower as it has to both check bounds and for nul and any difference between memcpy and strcpy isn t worth changing code for speculatively


null nonsense complete
it was never intended to be some safe version of strcpy - that s complete nonsense since strncpy is far more unsafe because of the null termination issue

it is in fact considered to be much more dangerous than strcpy since the null termination mechanism of strncpy is not intuitive and therefore often misunderstood


multiplying	add---------------------------------------------------

slower years
as of a few years ago multiplying was 3x slower than add

its the multiplying that historically was slower than the add


others
the pattern is if the integer is even divide it by 2 if the integer is odd and larger than 1 multiplying it by 3 and add 1

where multiplying binds more tightly than add

so the bottom line is after every divide do the multiplying the 5 with 5 and if the result of multiplication is less than the equals to n then divide the n with result and add the zeros counter variable

functionally a multiplying will always take more time than an add because it combines a true multiplying along with a true addition step

multiplying is still somewhat more expensive than add on modern computers and compilers go to some effort to replace them with one or two shifts+add instructions

if 50 is replaced by x a value known only at runtime there will be a multiplication before the add the multiplication canbe optimised into a faster operation if the multiplicand is simple enough as one instruction because there is support to multiplying by 1 2 4 8 and 16 - at least in some processors and even risc processors multiplication is often more complex than a few add and shift operations - small numbers are often very easy to deal with this way but 575 or 13412 may not be so easy to convert to a small number of simple operations so a proper multiplication will be needed

on a cpu with a fast multiplier multiplying may only be on the order of 4 times slower than add but on normal hardware it s 16-32 times slower for a 32 bit operation

they add horizontal pairs of multiplying results producing wider elements

for example fp add throughput is lower than fma or multiplying on intel before skylake 1 vector per clock instead of 2

if x is less than 1 add -1 to e and multiplying x by 2

like this you can add subtract multiplying and divide more easily

however lets say i want g to do something more complex than multiplying by 2 like ask the user for a number and add that like so


faster cycles multiplication
the multiplying operation uses more clock cycles than the add on many processors

in the remote case those operations are not simplified assuming that there is a jit that maps the multiplication and add opcodes in a 1 1 relationship to their cpu instruction counterparts in most modern architectures all integer arithmetic operations usually take the same number of cycles so it will be faster multiplying once than add four times just checked it addition is still slightly faster than multiplication 1 clock vs 3 clocks so it still pays using a multiplication here

however multiplying is faster than adding even though less clock cycles are used to add verses multiplying according to what my particular cpu s datasheet says about the instructions being used

add is faster than mul but if you want to multiplying two general values mul is far faster than any loop iterating add operations

while it is true that a simple shift or add is often faster than a multiplication but not always â multiplication are faster than you might think the only way you could use it here inside the loop is if you first checked to see that you were supposed to be multiplying by 2 and the cost of doing that check more specifically the cost of making the decision as a result of that check is far more costly than a simple integer multiplication


precedence divide higher
multiplying and divide have higher precedence than add and subtract

i would like to add the pow in my evaluator with an higher precedence than multiplying and divide

with extra braces because multiplying has a higher precedence than add - assuming these are both percentage discounts

a slightly more sophisticated approach with add subtract multiplying divide

moreover i would like to add the pow in my evaluator with an higher precedence than multiplying and divide

in the above example the instance of exprbinopadd is a child of the instance of exprbinopmul although precedence of multiplying is higher than precedence of add which results from the proper consideration of the parentheses

then i think it would be the problem of precedence in most case they are left-to-right and i think multiplying would be calculated first because in c multiplying is more prior than add instruction by one level

but my guess would be that in this particular chunk of code multiplying divide and modulo all take roughly the same amount of time and that time is greater than add or subtract

to give multiplying and divide higher precedence than add and subtract you can do something like this example adapted from john levine lex yacc 2 e 1992

can someone explain this behaviour multiplying operator has higher precedence than add operator


lower resolutions instructions
integer add subtract compare instructions but not multiplying are also lower latency than their fp counterparts

you can add higher and lower resolutions by multiplying or dividing them by 2


better bit-shifted sub
add sub are cheaper than multiplying better throughput and lower latency

still while it might be better than multiplying by say 17 16+1 or 12 8+4 as they only add in a couple bit-shifted copies of the original value instead of five it s a very weak hash compared to hash functions that do more than a single running multiplication and i ll illustrate that using some statistical analysis.


ssd	sata---------------------------------------------------

others
with this set each time you boot and the sata negotiated link speed of the ssd is less than 3 it s going to reboot until it s 3 however many times it takes

as compilation is mostly reading small files i wonder if buying a fast usb key to work on can speed up compilation time compared to a standard sata drive and with a lower price than an ssd drive 16gb keys are 30

the ssd disks are from 4 to 8 times faster than a sata hdd depending on the model

using faster disk connections sata etc. and or upgrading to a ssd might help but more cpu power will not


google-chrome	firefox---------------------------------------------------

second seconds time
i ve tried to load the page on google-chrome not blazingly fast but acceptable less than 1 second then tried on firefox takes more time between 2 and 3 seconds

however firefox takes significantly longer to run this code about 180 milliseconds on firefox compared to roughly 30 on ie and google-chrome and does not see that same reduction in run time that ie and google-chrome does

for example try hiding a dom of of 200+ children in google-chrome vs safari vs firefox you will notice google-chrome takes 20+ sec safari takes 5+ seconds firefox takes less than 1 second


smarter careless onunload
turns out using onunload is behaving as documented in firefox but google-chrome is just smarter with it or something still investigating but i ll mark this question as answered

i guess google-chrome is smarter about me being careless than firefox is


extensions easier extension
firefox extensions have much more power than google-chrome and have wider access to browser s internal api

i found programming google-chrome extensions easier than firefox but i couldn t come across something similar to xpcom in google-chrome

with firefox it was very easy i just grabbed the apk from their ftp server run the adb install command one would think it should be even easier with google-chrome but it s really not

other types of firefox extensions are significantly more capable than webextensions google-chrome extensions

firefox has a more advanced plugin than the google-chrome extension but both work

after looking into the issue with the inspection tools of both browsers it seems that firefox is making the #main_nav_bar ul 10px wider than google-chrome

the namespace is supported specifically to make cross-browser extensions with google-chrome in particular porting from google-chrome to firefox easier

i know js and i ve maked extension for google-chrome before but i think making for firefox is alittle harder

i have been trying to do this in firefox webextensions but if it s easier with google-chrome i will try it that way instead.

first just a heads up you may want to try firebug+firepath on firefox which is a more handy tool than google-chrome s developer tool

also google-chrome has a great tool that allows you to edit css on the fly which i find more useful and quicker than using firefox s extensions

also about firefox i know still less than google-chrome and i m not sure about how it innerly manage resources among threads and if it is even possible to achieve what i want but if possible i d need to do the same work with firefox threads

on stable versions of google-chrome the permissions show allow and it still won t connect even with firefox works older versions of google-chrome work

2 install the firefox extension there s also one for google-chrome but the firefox one is more reliable -- so if you re a google-chrome addict like i am then use both

i found that google-chrome was easier to get working than firefox but firefoxes tools such as firebug were quite nice to work with

firefox is probably easier than google-chrome these days

google-chrome extensions are considerably more limited than firefox extensions â â they can only hook the behavior of the browser in certain predefined ways

google-chrome extensions are much easier to learn and create than firefox

firefox just provides far more access to its own internals and system to the extensions so its technically possible to do more with them than with opera widgets or google-chrome extensions


better firebug tools
in firefox this might be handled a little nicer than google-chrome but rather than completely redraw an element you should try to append only what you need

until people have more experience with google-chrome i would think firefox is a better choice

and additionally the algorithm that google-chrome uses is better than the one in firefox at least for handling the resizing of text

google-chrome has a bigger time difference yet firefox is the one with the gap in the animation

my knowledge of firefox is better than google-chrome so my apologies if i missed something

is it a bug in google-chrome or am i more or less lucky to get this chaining to work in firefox

of late firefox has had much better performance than google-chrome

this is sporadic and i see it happening most of the time with firefox 4.0.1 and 5.0 and to a lesser extent with google-chrome

we wish google-chrome was better but the reality is that it s still not as good as firefox

the only thing is that flexbox is not supported by older browser support by ie10+ google-chrome 20+ safari 3.1+ firefox 2+ read more about support so i probably would need to add the flexie polyfill to support this on older browser

i guess firefox and safari handle huge numbers of elements better than google-chrome

in my personal experience it is impossible to modify the browser behavior in google-chrome if the addon api does not allow for it - in firefox this is much easier to change as much of the interface logic is written in javascript and there are api s for just about anything

firefox is easier and better than google-chrome in finding the element from the webpage

the performance in google-chrome is best less so in firefox and ie

you can do this by looking into the source code or better with firebug firefox or developer tools ie google-chrome in the network tab

on my computer firefox performs much better than google-chrome on these tests using jsperf

google-chrome shows it better than firefox firebug

although firefox is a better browser for developers than google-chrome cause it gives you more tools to work with

a similar tool is now present in firefox you had to use firebug before but google-chrome is more used partly because of its more powerful js engine v8

firefox is more picky about characters that are set in uris than google-chrome

google-chrome sends back and html collection that is longer really better imo than firefox ie or chromium

performance is browser and device dependent for example firefox handles objects better than arrays while google-chrome prefers arrays

google-chrome dev tools are by far better than firefox ie whatever imho

they use iframes in firefox which seems better but in google-chrome they do this by putting manually defined span and font tags

there is a firebug version available for google-chrome firebug lite but the firefox version is much better and i d highly recommend you at least try it out

so firefox is better than google-chrome - but both suck in that regard

evidently firefox debugger firebug is better than google-chrome debugger

ie8 is the same and firefox is much better but i ve migrated away to google-chrome now so would like to stick with the one browser if possible

you can see if you look at the bottom and right hand edges of both google-chrome lines up perfectly but firefox seems further in both directions and i cannot work out why either in firebug or google-chrome dev tools

have i discovered a bug in firefox or is google-chrome just doing a better job of clearing up my shonky javascipt

phantomjs achieves a better accuracy than firefox slightly lower than google-chrome but in around half the time of firefox

also ie and firefox seems to work better than google-chrome

it s not the first time that the plugin for firefox works better for me than the one for google-chrome

after fixing css background-image style formatting to get better compatibility with firefox and ie i found that google-chrome intermittingly loses the background images when you scroll up and down on the page

in firefox the render of new tiles and the panning is laggy this is not the case when using maps.google.com so it s not an issue of google-chrome being better than firefox

no and there won t be any time soon because google-chrome s add-on api is more restrictive than firefox

also it does appear that firefox consistently handles this better than ie or google-chrome

also consider doing a web search for responsive bookmarklet tools for results that can help a-bit more than google-chrome s inspector or firefox s firebug

basically the way google-chrome renders text looks ugly and i want it to look like or almost like firefox or safari which looks thinner and better

i have tried firefox and it better than google-chrome crash issue is not always happen but not solved this issue

firefox works a bit better than google-chrome but the settimeout just seems to delay the final result being shown rather than delaying each step

and it would look better with the firefox s google-chrome hidden

another alternative for javascript ajax is writing a google-chrome add-on easier than firefox or embeding a web browser within your application

in my experience google-chrome has better javascript performance than firefox

i used firefox as it can be configured to download to a default directory but i don t think the google-chrome situation is any better

the logs only seem to work with a google-chrome browser which is a laugh as usually firefox is better at running google apps than google-chrome

it works great in google-chrome and safari haven t tested ie but i m sure it s somehow worse than firefox

pd note that firefox s developer tools are better and more complete than google-chrome developer tools but in essence are for the same purpose

firefox on nexus 7 is a bit better at producing reasonable sample rate readings but the updating of the display is even more sluggish than google-chrome

instead of firefox or ie i use google-chrome and i superficially feel google-chrome is responding better

is it because google-chrome has much better javascript support than firefox

google-chrome handles these better than compared to firefox

firefox handles this better than google-chrome does but neither exactly the way i want

install firebug firefox version is better then a google-chrome one

also for animations google-chrome chromium behaves much better that is why i use it for development but do my general browsing in firefox

i have already run into problems with old javascript code which i thought was standards compliant by firefox or opera standards - which are pretty good but google-chrome was even more picky

the google-chrome apis are currently experimental hence these tools are likely to be better developed under firefox

when i ran the test individually with a timer google-chrome actually performed better than firefox hope this helps

it seems google-chrome applies some formatting to render better than firefox

here is a screenshot of how it is displayed on internet explorer better than firefox but not centered like in google-chrome

especially sensitive in google-chrome as firefox had a better response time---

used to be firefox but google-chrome is nicer out of the box

bad buffering can also be a result of a slow computer because statistics show that google-chrome is better for a normal-fast computer and firefox works best on slow computers

if you are able to enforce browser usage i find that google-chrome on android preserves line breaks when copying and pasting much better than firefox

ps i ve noticed that in google-chrome situation is better than in firefox but new line still starts beneath tag

transparency is also an issue however google-chrome seems to handle all three better than firefox

also why does firefox perform way better than google-chrome on this benchmark

in firefox it s much better than google-chrome but still not as black as ie

my firefox adds more chopping to video playing itself google-chrome plays the video much better

however mobile device emulation is one of the point where the google-chrome devtools are more feature rich than firefox firebug

what s up with google-chrome that the debugger behaves less conveniently than firefox

whether you use a plugin or write your own code css only is a no go for google-chrome safari and as you said firefox is better at dealing with it

font looks sharp in google-chrome safari ie8 not as good as other 2 but less fuzzy than firefox

better use google-chrome even thought firefox is not slower than google-chrome for once probably the tracing for the image comparison pays off yay


browsers image webkit-based
it s more effective with firefox more than google-chrome or any other browsers

solved the problem came from css specificity.bootstrap s css was judged more specific by google-chrome regarding my menu s selector but not by firefox and safari

browsers like google-chrome for instance won t allow it where as firefox can be more lenient in some cases

animation effect works fine for the lower image with firefox and ie-9 browsers whereas google-chrome does not show animation

maybe google-chrome is more lenient when it comes to illegal characters in the url than firefox or something like that

in ie and firefox fullscreen_block appears closer to the bottom than in safari and google-chrome

update3 now it works here which means that i couldn t fully reproduce my bug to show it to you but in general the problem is that the height of 5x5 table in google-chrome is less from firefox on 22px which is 22px gap between table container and a table itself

firefox is more tolerant when it comes to image headers then ie and google-chrome

however with this method image in firefox appears to be blurred at least if resized and in google-chrome it looks lighter sic

the function is available in browsers newer than google-chrome 39 and firefox 31

notably this doesn t happen in all browsers google-chrome renders more smoothly than ie and firefox for instance but is there any way i can make those white lines stop appearing when the user zooms in

in firefox and other browsers the background is much whiter and brighter than in google-chrome

in ie and google-chrome the table ends up under my image while in firefox it takes more that 100 an horizontal scroll bar is displayed

if you are trying to support all users on all browsers then you will certainly need to do testing on those browsers although actively developing on those browsers may not be necessary whereas if you only need to support webkit-based browsers google-chrome safari or webkit-based browsers and firefox that is less testing that you need to do

google-chrome was more tolerant showed the button while firefox caught the bad selector

all the webkit-based browsers safari google-chrome and opera should be closer in their rendering to each other than firefox or ie 9 separately


ram memory
we use google-chrome though which i believe uses more ram than firefox

firefox allocates lots of memory during that preloading up to 20-30 times more than google-chrome or safari do and even twice as much as ie


stricter data seconds
google-chrome is stricter than firefox when it comes to loading data from your local filesystem

but i am still curios why is the policy set stricter with google-chrome than for example firefox

apparently google-chrome is pickier than firefox

using the same data google-chrome does in less than 5 seconds what took ie and firefox 10 to 15 seconds to accomplish

google-chrome seems to allow this i do not know why but firefox is somewhat stricter

i d say that firefox is correct in being stricter than google-chrome here even though i m not entirely sure the base uri has changed and this new uri should be used for the relative uri #symboltype1 too

in google-chrome the same flow renders in 13 seconds but firefox takes more than 51 seconds

it looks like it shows for firefox more-so than google-chrome but it might help


smaller bigger text
safari and opera work with the google-chrome setting but firefox and ie display the iframed page larger than google-chrome causing part of the text to be cut off

the same word in firefox look wider than in google-chrome

currently with the 10px top padding the cells in google-chrome look taller than in firefox

arabic default font in google-chrome is larger than it is in firefox

in ie6 7 8 and in google-chrome text has proper size but in firefox it s bigger

in google-chrome it is appearing higher than the original in firefox

why height in google-chrome is bigger than firefox of input

let s say you wanted a table border-radius of 50 on google-chrome and safari but firefox is adding more padding by default so you d like to tone it down for that browser alone to 45

and i get connection was interrupted in google-chrome or connection was reset in firefox for uploading docs bigger than 4 mb

while the rest of the browsers report the correct width of the document firefox reports a smaller one example at screen resolution of 1920x1080 ie google-chrome and safari reports 1920 while firefox reports 1903

the issue that i encountered was that google-chrome was giving me height about 300px more than the firefox ie

however since around 2006 think ie7+ firefox 2+ google-chrome etc browsers no longer provide the full file path they only provide the file s name without directory information

my menu links seem in google-chrome correctly but in firefox my menu links are 1 px smaller than google-chrome

it looks normal in google-chrome every column doesn t resize after updating whereas in firefox it gets smaller and smaller

found that the issue stemmed from using the firefox webdriver which apparently has much higher security than its google-chrome counterpart

i ve ran into out of memory errors on firefox with canvas heights greater than 8000 google-chrome seems to handle much higher at least to 32000

i tried here but google-chrome doesn t show any styling except font color while firefox shows some more

what s interesting is that firefox and ie9 will process the larger data set just fine but i thought google-chrome had a larger stack size limit than either of these browsers so i would ve expected them both to fail as well

if we remove the font-size it appears properly in google-chrome but shows up smaller in firefox

it looks like while google-chrome and safari are trying to do the right thing with 0px firefox is sticking closer to the standard

the code looks good in firefox but in google-chrome there are bigger spaces between the items

firefox recognizes this attribute but webkit google-chrome safari etc don t more info on caniuse.com

it displays ok in google-chrome and safari but in firefox it has more space between the text and the bottom border than between the text and the top border

the position of the list in firefox is always higher than that of google-chrome no matter how i padding or margin the list

it seems that in firefox ie the line-through style is a bit lower than google-chrome i am not sure if this is because of the implementation of different browsers or something

in google-chrome the button is wider than in firefox

that happens because pixels size in google-chrome is bigger than in firefox

what firefox displays is about 5 inches higher than what google-chrome displays

i just found out that if you re using google-chrome you trigger antialiasing at 49px or higher however with firefox it s set at 257px or higher

firefox thumbnail 4 times smaller than on google-chrome

in firefox the input button has more padding than in google-chrome

in google-chrome the green div is bigger than in firefox i really don t know what is the problem i think in firefox it displays as it should but in google-chrome and ie9 it displays different

i built a site and the problem is google-chrome display font-size 1px bigger than firefox

suffice to say ie and google-chrome start having problems at larger heights than does firefox

by highlighting the shape of the two elements you can see that in firefox left the button is 2px taller than in google-chrome right

but in firefox the left-collumn gets a much bigger height than in google-chrome

firefox s default textbox includes more padding than ie google-chrome

ie firefox higher than baseline google-chrome on baseline

pc google-chrome and safari are fine ie shows the links like in the picture firefox shows more revealed urls

the height of the blue bar in safari and google-chrome matches but in firefox it is smaller

now this works fine in google-chrome and safari and i have had to use assitional css settings for firefox but ie and opera both display my ribbon div about 25px higher than in google-chrome or safari

font-face bold in firefox is bolder than in google-chrome

the font rendered in google-chrome left have more space on the top versus firefox

google-chrome doesn t implement the sizing correctly and firefox does although in your case the default behaviour of google-chrome is closer to what you want

the next text is an overlay between firefox und google-chrome - firefox is broader

if i remove this code the width of green image in firefox becomes smaller but it s still bigger than necessary about 100px the google-chrome images keeps unchanged

i know different engines render fonts differently and but the issue i m having is that firefox renders the font higher than google-chrome - at the size i am displaying the font this is very noticeable 3 or 4 px - which on a button means they re totally misaligned

google-chrome renders longer input fields than firefox and ie

even if you give the inputs a attribute firefox renders them wider than google-chrome

internet explorer s limit is lower than firefox s or google-chrome s and varies between versions

but the text turns out to be much bigger under firefox compared to that under google-chrome

i have a search positioned absolutely beside my navigation but the top is 10px lower than firefox in google-chrome so basically if it is centered in firefox it hangs low on google-chrome

on linux google-chrome displays text about one pixel higher than firefox and opera

here my problem is date input field in aligning correctly in firefox but in google-chrome it is displaying bigger than all other text boxes

in firefox it seems that this is 1px lower than in google-chrome and safari

regarding the viewport resizing firefox goes 10 by 10 while google-chrome has a wider range 25 33 50 67 ... and other browsers may have other values

px firefox will display smaller and smaller shadow while when google-chrome goes below 1px it suddenly displays nothing

why in firefox text smaller left than in google-chrome and opera right

i have too problem with text in the firefox is bigger maybe bolder as in google-chrome .

here the working header request with firefox bigger than google-chrome request

the idea is that if they are using ie then they must install google-chrome frame and if they are using less than firefox 4 or opera 11.5 then they must upgrade their browser not not sure if the way i am doing that is correct

for my website i noticed that tooltip delay in firefox was much higher than in google-chrome

regarding frequency of polling when no connection is maintained google-chrome appears to be 3 seconds where as firefox s is much larger

google-chrome renders passwords smaller than firefox

firefox produces more space compared to google-chrome

when i have a lower width for the browser firefox ie and google-chrome that is lower than 980px this fixed menu should not appear

in google-chrome the button should be a tad smaller than in firefox

for example if you have a text size of 15px well firefox makes a larger 15px than google-chrome does

i have an iframe inside a list i m using a slider and on google-chrome sets its size perfectly but on firefox it has a smaller size

google-chrome has no issues in this code.the default zoom level of firefox is higher than it was in the earlier version

firefox text is 1px lower than in google-chrome and ie

when viewing my text area in firefox it shows up a correct width col 30 however in ie and google-chrome it s significantly smaller

the reason this is happening is because firefox renders the select box as a taller element than google-chrome and the container of the blue text is getting caught on the select s container element because it s now sticking out lower than the others

on my mac firefox has no issues whatsoever but google-chrome is worse than i think you ve noticedâ the text exceeds the bounds of the container after the resize

google-chrome placed more importance on your body margin than firefox did and used your style as higher priority

that i gave to every link in the set of links home about us products contact and it seems that firefox is making that 1px margin much bigger than safari or google-chrome and distorting it

in google-chrome the font appears to be 1px smaller than firefox and ie and i cannot see why

on windows the while loops above is 20 faster than the original for-loop in google-chrome in ie and firefox both loops perform the same

i want to set my own time limit rather than use the browser s default i believe google-chrome s is much longer than firefox s

firefox has like 40px less width than google-chrome in columns which is causing problems

i ve found that the font-size in firefox is a bit larger than in google-chrome

reducing cols fix issue on firefox but on ie google-chrome it show more space towards right

this is due to the simple fact that firefox has been in the extension business longer than google-chrome or ie

this is because in ie and firefox the footer link text is larger than in google-chrome and safari therefore the margins that i ve set up for the icons do not work

it looks like google-chrome is smaller in your screenshot there so firefox could just not be at the defined break-point yet

even then google-chrome s fonts look thinner than in firefox or ie


others
this problem was harsher in firefox 24 than in google-chrome 29 since firefox would crash sooner around 2000 ms sooner than google-chrome

the advantage that you have is that unlike upgrading an operating system upgrading from ie7 to google-chrome 8 or firefox 3.6 is a more reachable goal for the average user of your app especially if you provide a link and upgrade instructions

you can view it live on cssdesk this method works in a lot more than google-chrome but breaks in firefox 3.0 and just doesn t work in a number of ie versions

it s clearly visible in firefox and is far more subtle yet also distinguishable in google-chrome

i had a hiccup in firefox but found a fix after figuring out firefox is a bit more picky than google-chrome when defining svg attributes

google-chrome recent builds only and firefox are behaving very strict in this regard no matter how much content you have it will be no bigger than your viewport while opera presto behaves more like a table 100 is treated as a minimum not a maximum

i m sticking with firefox debugging of my angular 2 app outside of vs code as its user experience is better than google-chrome especially when working with typescript files so i ll stick with that for now unless i can figure this out

to answer my own question neither google-chrome nor firefox support more than two values in background-position

google-chrome is reporting the missing key with a higher severity than firefox is so i want to eliminate that as a possible cause

the second happened when you remove everything and starting type and hit enter different browsers behavior very differently google-chrome insert very first line as a just text node of contenteditable container and than put every new line into div opera 12.12 handle it better and it never allows remove last div node ie9-10 starting jump around and after you started again uses p tags instead of div that s not even such a disaster just inconsistency but yet the firefox is not yet even trying to change it s br behavior

but if firebug donâ t enabled after launch firefox â time equal 2ms that faster than opera and google-chrome and difference between empty filled array disappears

this is trickier to work around and you should file a google-chrome bug describing the situation and where it s slower than firefox but you could potentially reduce the amount of buffer uploads by looking into instancing or using uniform arrays instead of updating vertexes for positions textures

you might be able to avoid asking this sort of question in the future if you start using a google-chrome s inspect element context menu command or b firebug for firefox which is more or less the same thing

but it does seem like adding will make firefox behave more like google-chrome in this specific case

often google-chrome is understanding more thing then it should and firefox is bringing you the reality back in your face eheh

or does this mean firefox is less secured on that point than google-chrome

as you can see here a friend of mine did some testing and it seems that google-chrome and ie work a lot faster with the dot syntax while firefox and safari are more keen on the key syntax

btw google-chrome is less close to w3c specs than firefox de 42+ i d opt to start using firefox for your initial testing and then test it in ch to detect quirks

try your current setup in google-chrome google-chrome typically has a narrower minimum viewport width and try something like min-width 600px in firefox and your styles should be applied as expected layout.css will be applied when the viewport is at least 600px wide

this is to get it in firefox to be more like in google-chrome

firefox is more technically correct in this case as it outputs the state of the object at each point in the loop whereas google-chrome is apparently waiting until the end of the loop to output each console.log but i m not aware of a standards specification that covers the console host object

but firefox keeps being less responsive than google-chrome or ie

but given what the note says above i would say that ie and firefox are closer to the intended css3 definition since in google-chrome you can t seem to change a table s box model using the box-sizing property

this doesn t happen in google-chrome and is less frequent in firefox than in ie

is it possible to adjust rendering of svg content on safari and google-chrome to resemble more firefox rendering

given these last two complications i am leaning towards a browser plugin as the solution probably firefox since low-level http stuff seems to be better supported than in google-chrome but i am wondering if anyone has an idea for a more cross-browser-y solution and or if there is something out there that might provide a good api for this kind of thing

firefox takes almost 3 times longer than google-chrome

obviously google-chrome is more persnickety whereas firefox defaults to moving and sizing the printout as necessary

so if something works on safari it s more likely to work straightaway on google-chrome more than it is on firefox - but that s just a family resemblance at the end of the day you ll still have to test each as every webkit browser product and version still uses a different version of webkit

google-chrome is more flexible in this sense than firefox which is why it works there

this happens in firefox and also in google-chrome cells shrink less in google-chrome but not in safari

in google-chrome a basic for-loop is faster than i-- and --i while in firefox it s slower

the google-chrome renders the letters using pointy ends but the firefox uses more solid and bold effect

any ideas why google-chrome is apply more spacing than firefox ie

i think it mostly depends on the interprter engine in browser which responsible for interpreting th scripts which server sends to your browser and another thing about firefox as you have mentioned the extension in firefox is also responsible for it and another thing which i think matters a lot the developement of the browser as you can see google-chrome has same ui on all windows linux mac since it is mostly written in java so it requires jvm to run hence it is slow as compared to firefox which is written separately for each os using the respective oss apis hence it is fast since it directly interacts with os than interacting with jvm which in turn interacts with os like in case of chrome.still google-chrome is faster in incognito mode because of its intelligence to keep frequently data cached if you ll see the temporary files created by google-chrome they are huge in size as compared to that of firefox

in firefox it s less noticeable but in google-chrome it s very noticeable

google-chrome always reports 250 for both widths as expected but firefox always reports a larger number though the exact number may depend on the os and or version of firefox and or phase of the moon

fwiw i was able to solve my problem with greensock using tweenmax to animate individual paths inside and this worked in firefox gecko and webkit browsers safari google-chrome it does a better job of calculating the origin not exactly sure how but it worked for me

google-chrome decided to treat them as function declarations and hoists them firefox treats them more like function expressions

firefox encodes more characters than google-chrome

this all works well and good in firefox but when i try it in google-chrome which supports more html5 features it tries to load the url undefined in whatever directory i m in

firefox may be sniffing the document s encoding with more flexibility than google-chrome is

firefox is clearly less secured it deliberately allows something that google-chrome locks down

i suspect that this may be the case because ie and google-chrome need to know about the content of the div earlier than firefox

firefox window was less than 991px so appeared to be working google-chrome window was 991 so appeared to not be working

i ve been trying to sum up values over a swipe and see how different browsers report values and they vary a lot with safari reporting order of magnitude bigger numbers on almost all platforms google-chrome reporting quite more like 3 times more than firefox firefox being balanced on the long run but quite different among platforms on small movements on ubuntu gnome nearly only +3 or -3 seems like it sums up smaller events and then send a big +3

not all browsers support all operation most notable is firefox not supporting darker use multiply instead but google-chrome edge and firefox support all the others listed above

in my testing google-chrome is nicer it pops-up the unresponsive alert whereas firefox apparently doesn t care

firefox apply the last one contrary to google-chrome and ie it s possible that they consider that the first .gecko.single-portfolio renders the whole rule invalid

firefox safari google-chrome and opera make up more than 30 of the market and they support many html5 standards

so why is google-chrome less efficient than firefox and ie

in google-chrome there is more files download 47 than in firefox ie 42

unlike google-chrome which dies silently the latest firefox is more helpful

however a sdp object local description by firefox does not contain datachannel at all and moreover the sdp is much shorter than google-chrome and less information bundled

i also have .js files being redirected to javascript engines as well for main.js in google-chrome it tries main.v8.js in safari main.nitro.js in firefox main.gecko.js

is this a google-chrome bug an unresolved issue with the specification or is firefox simply providing more functionality than required

looks like for the slice use-case on google-chrome using a literal is about 4 slower on my machine on firefox it s more lke 9 with no difference at all on ie10

graph beeing cut in google-chrome is a known issue google-chrome does not respect some print css and works much better with firefox not all versions still

google-chrome does not check revocation in most cases and firefox might use a shorter timeout and ignore failures

in firefox it takes some more time compared to google-chrome safari

firefox has supported the newer functions since v39.0 google-chrome is slated to get support in v50

surly the input type should be text if the value expected is dublin -- google-chrome might be cleaver enough to recognise that the input is actually text whereas firefox and ie might be more gullible and not even try to set the variable

i ve learned partly by trawling this site that the google-chrome security is fussier and the app loads correctly without errors in firefox and ie but i can t find any resources that are loaded from a non https source

i m trying to add a ribbon to a page using css3 linear-gradients but the rendering in google-chrome looks a lot less pleasant than its firefox or ie alternative

when i posted this on facebook someone said that since firefox is open source project developers optimized math.min but google-chrome didn t since google-chrome is just a modification of chromium but beside that above statement is not quite right that makes no sense because that doesn t explain the reason why google-chrome s and firefox s math.min a b performs in similar speed and google-chrome s math.min a b and firefox s performs in same speed because if firefox is faster than google-chrome then google-chrome s math.min a b should be much slower than firefox s

use firefox network in development tools and check your requests sometimes it just sends options request in cross origin i insist on firefox because it s network tool is much more detailed than google-chrome and safari

having said that the google-chrome devtools as well as the firefox devtools have many more features and other smaller and bigger advantages over firebug as the team behind firebug is very small in comparison to the teams behind the other devtools

ellipsis still wraps in google-chrome but is more user friendly in firefox by adding the .

i use google-chrome as my main browser but sometimes firefox has much more verbose errors warnings that can make debugging a complex issue easier

it works fine even for italics but i m aware that the user s browser is being asked to make a best-guess here and have noticed that google-chrome will make individual chars appear slightly fatter than firefox when i do things this way

google-chrome is letting me get into bad habits and is happy to parse that format but firefox is stricter

check in firefox in google-chrome we have a cross-browser thinking

if the loop is very tight time-budget-wise there will simply not be any room for the browser to do other tasks such as gc - for google-chrome this task seem to be secondary versus firefox which gives this higher priority likely to get more performance out of its engine

but do keep in mind you re optimizing for a particular js engine when you re doing that v8-optimized code might generate cleaner memory in google-chrome and safari but for all you know ie might make a complete hash of things or some of the tricks you ve used cause firefox to slow down more than a fairly large array would have done in the first place

support exists in firefox and my test just confirmed thisâ but the handle is a little less noticeable than in google-chrome

firefox for example has a lot in common with google-chrome and safari and google-chrome and safari are even more so closely related

i have just noticed a site i am working on looks different in google-chrome than other browsers saf firefox everything is more saturated in google-chrome even a background-color rgb

firefox can get away with more than google-chrome before aborting

is there a way to get firefox to behave more like google-chrome when it comes to focus being set by mouse clicks without having to sacrifice accessibility by setting outline to none or 0

the vertical spacing in firefox between the real estate search h2 tag and the form input field for san francisco ca #city-field input tag is perfect but in google-chrome google-chrome is applying more extra vertical spacing than desired

i planned on using svgs for the entire site but with only 20-30 svg images of medium to high complexity used in the page and google-chrome already seems to be showing som jank and high paint times for scroll and firefox is even worse though safari seems to do a lot better

the center align property must be cascading from some other element because it s not only safari google-chrome which also uses webkit but also opera that shows the things center aligned and both safari google-chrome and opera are more standards compliant than ie and even firefox

in any case vorbis clearly has the most coverage google-chrome has more of the market than safari now opera is about half of safari and obviously firefox is huge and it doesn t really have the strong opposition that theora has


right information console
on firefox all seems right and a 200 code is returned but with google-chrome you have more information and will see a access-control-allow-origin error

they show up centered on mozilla firefox but in google-chrome it aligns more to the right hand side

in google-chrome it seems more or less ok but in firefox when i first tried it it should give me not logged in my console

on firefox they ask for more information and they show a captcha but not on google-chrome

the google-chrome console gives more information than the firefox console

thus i think firefox is perhaps more right but other developers at google-chrome think otherwise


earlier fine root
the window.external.addsearchprovider xml_url works fine in firefox as earlier the problem is only with the google-chrome since google-chrome supported earlier and don t know the root cause of not able to add now

if google-chrome seems to finish earlier than firefox then that is the freezing glitch in action

it works fine in firefox but in google-chrome it sends more than one requests to servlet and finally there is exception in servlet and it doesn t work


forgiving html errors
while in google-chrome usually another page refresh fix it firefox is more stubborn

in general i have found google-chrome to be more finnicky than firefox

firefox which is more standards-compliant than google-chrome doesn t allow this

most likely your post value has one or more characters in it that are breaking the html of the page and ie firefox are being a bit more forgiving than google-chrome is

google-chrome is just more forgiving for some mistakes then firefox

i guess google-chrome is a bit more forgiving than firefox

google-chrome provides more detailed information about the ajax errors even when firefox doesn t say anything

actually your code doesn t work on firefox because he is less forgiving than google-chrome about errors

i m taking a quite educated guess here that firefox is more forgiving with the irregular syntax than google-chrome

google-chrome is more forgiving or you could call it less compliant firefox less so

in my experience firefox is sometimes more lenient than google-chrome but i would definitely test in both

some css updates may also be needed but this may help firefox behave more like google-chrome for your html

is this expected and google-chrome is behaving correctly or is firefox just being more tolerant


error weird server
this does not seem to occur in safari or ie and a similar permission error occurs sometimes in firefox but is reproducible more often than not in google-chrome

in your example fn is attempting to call call but it s not specifying the context which typically defaults to the window object but in this case it just makes it undefined which triggers a weird error in google-chrome as you discovered but firefox is clearer about the problem

you forgot to open the so no more css after this line is considered in firefox and ie google-chrome is more cool on the error

google-chrome shows weird error but firefox shows more specific issue

when i run my http web server on google google-chrome it gives more 324 error than in firefox


strict date standards
google-chrome is a bit more strict than firefox here

apple s safari applies almost no cross domain restrictions to files opened locally but firefox is much more strict about what it permits with google-chrome somewhere in the middle

google-chrome s parsing may be more strict than firefox is at having things like trailing commas as specified by the standard at as stated in danilo celic s answer

firefox doesnt support the date format you have entered while google-chrome is more flexible and does support it

google-chrome is smart enough to guess where things should be closed and still work correctly but firefox has more strict of standards

here google-chrome cannot decide weather ma stands for march or may and gives an invalid date while firefox doesnt

it works in firefox because firefox is more lax about this security restriction and google-chrome happens to be more strict on mixed-content errors

ie7 is strict enough and used to give me javascript errors on them maybe google-chrome does it too firefox is more relaxed d

probably firefox just ignores it but google-chrome is more strict change code to

is this due to firefox being more strict than google-chrome

i think from my tests perhaps firefox has more strict standards than google-chrome about cookie manipulation

google-chrome is more permissive with delimiters when it comes to dates thus formatting the date with dashes works with google-chrome but not with firefox

google-chrome can read lots of locale-specific date time formats but firefox is pickier


strict switch object
i believe that ie11 only uses software and firefox may be less strict with its blacklisting of gpus but that doesn t explain why google-chrome can t switch to software when hardware is unavailable

firefox and ie9 require a proper domain to run from presumably because they are more strict than google-chrome in the way they associate the localstorate object to a domain in google-chrome it doesn t need to be a domain as such


internet explorer variations
when using a font declaration of arial firefox and ie11 show relatively huge variations while google-chrome and opera show smaller variations.

it seems that google-chrome internet explorer or safari are more strict than firefox on terms of security

i am using franklin gothic font for website and font looks good on google-chrome and safari but on internet explorer and mozilla firefox it looks darker

in that sense real life browsers firefox internet explorer google-chrome etc are much more flexible

while clicking open the dropdown before selecting the dropdownoption i wanted worked in google-chrome and internet explorer firefox was less forgiving and showed the weird behaviour

my website in developing process looking in mozilla firefox with same font-size declaration margin padding and different font-families always a few smaller than in google-chrome or internet explorer

answers in opera was checking browser support for my page and wanted to search some stuff up. i don t get this message in my default browser google-chrome nor in internet explorer or firefox


faster slower version
however if thats the case does this mean firefox is faster in execution than google-chrome

why is firefox so much slower than google-chrome on my laptop

it depends on the browser its definitely true for ie and firefox but seems slower on google-chrome

so i wonder the benchmark is also influenced by the installed extensions or google-chrome is really so much higher than firefox in performance

there seems to be a couple of points scrolling down the page where it gets stuck in google-chrome also tested firefox it seemed slightly slower at that point but not broken with the scroll wheel or up down arrows only moving a couple of pixels at a time

in ie8 and google-chrome it runs even faster than firefox in general and this slow down never happens

spidermonkey firefox is slower 50 of google-chrome max speed but the speed is consistent

at one point i even had a small scale on the .pan class that looked great in google-chrome but was even worse on firefox

after some investigation it seems this issue doesn t happen in google-chrome is related to newer firefox version 9.0.1 linux

what we can see is that regardless of raw hardware power google-chrome seems to run up to three times faster than edge and also significantly faster than firefox all updated to the latest verion

usually you want to avoid solutions from browser-vendor as they ll cater toward that specific browser but opera webkit google-chrome safari firefox devs are usually more knowledgeable in terms of cross-browser solutions and compliance with the standards than m ones

i would like this function to work in firefox ie google-chrome etc but at the moment it only works in google-chrome and older than firefox version 49

the most interesting thing i noted is that certain test combos in firefox are much quicker than even google-chrome

firefox is slower than google-chrome which boats one of the highest javascript engines a modified version of webkit

i ve tested the sample on firefox and it s a bit slower than google-chrome but usable

google-chrome is lightning fast when you use the dom api but vastly slower using the .innerhtml operator by a magnitude 1000-fold slower however firefox is worse than google-chrome in some areas for instance the append test is much slower than google-chrome but the innerhtml test runs much faster than google-chrome

also firefox 4 has hardware accelerated canvas that is marginally faster than ie9 and a lot faster than google-chrome

use firefox rather than google-chrome - google-chrome with dev mode is much slower than firefox

and of course the results - if they are reproducible - might suggest that google-chrome is faster than firefox or that firefox just prioritises timeouts over dom events

because of how google-chrome s plugin system works development mode in google-chrome is much slower than in firefox or safari see here for more details

the reason google-chrome is slower than firefox is that the devmode plugin runs in a sandbox so calls and data have to cross the sandbox boundaries

a very quick test suggests that the difference is probably negligible in google-chrome but that firefox is substantially quicker with indexof for short strings at least

i have encounter a problem with google-chrome that is similar to an older issue with firefox at this url scrolling blocks javascript execution in firefox

the problem with this approach is it works mostly in google-chrome but not in firefox which is slower

it appears firefox and older versions of google-chrome are far less picky with content-type headers on file downloads for apk s

the trouble is choosing a good value for x since for this particular page google-chrome is so very much faster than firefox which is faster than ie

it worked perfectly with google-chrome but safari 5 and firefox implement a more recent version of the websocket protocol and cramp does not so i couldn t get it to work there

i ve found that firefox is greatly faster with imacros than google-chrome

conclusion diff1 is faster in firefox opera and safari diff2 is faster in ie and google-chrome

google-chrome is just faster than firefox which just faster than ie at bit-wise operations

using firefox even it s slower than google-chrome it s still more respectful of privacy

rendering without buffering on google-chrome is faster than firefox so i m actually not sure why google-chrome is having such a problem with drawimage

as you can see ie 8 is about 5 times slower than firefox 3.6 and almost 20 times slower than google-chrome 9 at least when using sunspider tests

do you have any idea why google-chrome loads javascript function much slower than firefox

google-chrome is extremely slow for your code path but grep seems to be 50 faster than array.filter here making it 900 slower than the firefox run

for example using renatoargh s test google-chrome is faster with option 2 firefox with option 1

i m on a mac os x 10.8.2 running firefox 18.0.2 - it actually runs the game faster and smoother than my google-chrome 25.0.1364.99

oddly enough new array size is almost 2x faster than in google-chrome and about the same in firefox and ie measured by creating and filling an array

and also does anyone know why is firefox so much slower than google-chrome in 3d rendering

firefox ie10 and google-chrome use the newer hybi variant

i usually use google-chrome s developer mode which imho already gives even more details than firefox

i did a couple of screenshots and firefox canvas was faster than google-chrome capturevisibletab

i use google-chrome for development as i find it runs faster than firefox and ie so it is a bore to guess where the icons are

as google-chrome s v8 is dramatically faster than firefox s spidermonkey at the moment these things are constantly in flux pick the forward loop as it s faster on the slower engine

maybe google-chrome is working faster than firefox try adding a wait with expected conditions

so is there an issue with the map file i am thinking no cause firefox is able to read ok why is google-chrome referencing the less files

in my experience google-chrome will be a lot faster than firefox to debug huge js files

google-chrome being probably faster than ie or firefox seems to handle this differently

after inspecting the test in ie 8 9 and seeing its results look like those of firefox i think there s an explanation for the google-chrome results i m pretty sure google-chrome webkit has a better optimization in the first version of the test especially the parseint part which gives a better result for parseint there

but i guess google-chrome i have version 10 should be much faster than firefox 3.6

svg performance in firefox is slower than in webkit google-chrome and ie10

the latest stable firefox 3.6 is fast but for example google-chrome is even faster

on google-chrome it s significantly faster to do this using 1 0 but on firefox it s slightly faster to do this using bool

compared to a non worker version in google-chrome my benchmark is somewhat slower in firefox it is much slower

firefox gsap performance is still much worse than in google-chrome but google-chrome gsap does still lag every few repeats or so while in google-chrome the css animations do not

well unless you re targeting older than google-chrome 1.0 firefox 8.0 ie 4.0 opera 7.0 or safari 4.0 it s safe to use insertadjacenthtml

as for firefox being slower at rendering than google-chrome i can assure you that for most practical purposes it s not

tldr in firefox filter is slightly faster in google-chrome that s the opposite

the points of data in firefox and safari are much smoother in google-chrome they don t go past the dots

if you need to test with firefox then use an older version or google-chrome with the chromedriver

firefox is even slower that google-chrome

google-chrome or safari on a mac could be much faster than firefox on a pc especially with newer apis

the funny thing is that for abc_def property google-chrome is actually much faster than firefox and ie as i expected

update just tried it on firefox 30 and it did not experience the same slowdown in a worker thread but it was slower than google-chrome when run in the main thread

in fact i ran some tests at dhtml kitchen and found that in firefox opera and google-chrome document.write was actually faster on the first load and comparable in speed of standard html on subsequent refreshes

here is a simple performance test showing that in google-chrome filling is faster than clearing i am not sure what goes on with google-chrome and canvas nowadays but in firefox clearing is many times faster than filling both significantly faster than google-chrome

based on what you have provided i cannot tell if google-chrome actually does load faster than firefox

now when clicking a time less than 1 millisecond will be displayed however it obviously takes nearly a second on my computer until the changed color actually is displayed where btw. google-chrome seems to be faster than firefox

and found out that framerate of createjs easeljs is much worse in firefox than in google-chrome ie

firefox - good a bit slower than google-chrome

in google-chrome it seems .prototype is faster firefox shows no difference between the two although generally performs slower than google-chrome

in firefox it runs extremely slow 3-4 seconds in google-chrome it runs much faster

in google-chrome typeof is slower than the other two but in firefox it is the fastest

right now google-chrome is faster than firefox sunspider tests so your statement it loads faster in firefox is not really correct

this makes firefox 50x faster than google-chrome and 70x faster than safari is there any known reason for that

i was testing on google-chrome win7 but with firefox it seems worse

also google-chrome s map function is up to 2x slower than firefox on my machine

the results varied from a browser to another firefox 4.0b12 is faster using but google-chrome webkit and opera is faster when using

in ie java-script load slower than firefox safari and google-chrome

sometimes firefox might come out on top whereas other times google-chrome might be faster still

that means firefox is more than 7x faster than google-chrome here

so far this works how i wanted on google-chrome but it doesnt look the same when on firefox and looks even worse on ie 10

though from a design perspective it may be easier to simply add the extra 5px to the width designing for the worst case browser to prevent wrapping in google-chrome which is worse than extra space in firefox ie

i need to do the same condition but for less than google-chrome version 46 and for less than firefox version 44

i have been working with linear parsers lately and noticed the performance in google-chrome v37 was much slower than in firefox v30

when i try the demo in google-chrome or safari it is indeed much faster but when i ve tested it in firefox it s consistently slower

it is also proper browser behavior firefox is just stricter about it than google-chrome is

it s just a matter of preferences and browser implementation eg firefox works faster with brackets while google-chrome works faster with the dots

firefox is slower than google-chrome in javascript

as you said google-chrome is faster than firefox so the webdriver is trying to interact with the dom before when elements are not yet visible exist

different js engines are good at different things so depending on the test program you could have google-chrome being 5x faster than firefox say or vice versa

i am not concerned about the fact that firefox runs faster as browser js implementations will vary so much as the wide spread of results encountered in google-chrome that makes getting an accurate result impossible

my guess is google-chrome is caching more agressively and thats why you are seeing worse load time on firefox


jscrollbar	jslider---------------------------------------------------

others
aside you should probably look into using a jslider which seems more natural than using a jscrollbar for value adjustment


translation	localization---------------------------------------------------

others
you may find some localization firms are happier to start with a quality simplified chinese translation and adapt it to traditional but you may also find that many companies prefer to start with the english source

i don t need more than 2 localization now english and portuguese but i might need more later so it should be easy to add a translation if my app gets used by an russian site it should be able to send welcome emails in russian and with the name of the site brand that uses my app so i supposse what i want to do is something like a whitelabel product

consider training authors or adjusting localization and read folder permissions to only the authors responsible for translation for those publications

i d have one project team responsible for localization which may well involve more than just translation - different countries have different legal requirements currencies payment providers etc. and one team for improving the code base

is the best solution to add a new column called engmaterial and add the english translation there or is it possible to solve this in a better way with localization in .net

now i m not sure if i should store the strings in core data or use ios localization as the translation seem more like app data than true localization to me

this is where i learned that localization is a lot more than translation

the second example the plural form can be translation using more than two strings because part of localization file is how plural forms are arranges

localization it s easier to translation text than images


bitarray	bitset---------------------------------------------------

others
1 might not yet be sparse enough to make this better compared to just a plain bitarray assuming longs storing 64 bits each it doesn t take more than 2 longs to have more than one bitset on average but if the sparsity increases beyond that the space and time savings will show


namenode	checkpoint---------------------------------------------------

others
for efficiency secondary name node periodically does a checkpoint to update the fsimage so that the namenode recovery is faster


robospice	ion---------------------------------------------------

others
i ve used both robospice is more robust but ion is easier on the eyes


uilabel	nsstring---------------------------------------------------

others
but the problem i am facing if text is doted inside the label it calculates nsstring size less than uilabel size in the below code


stretchblt	bitblt---------------------------------------------------

others
from my tests bitblt is x75 faster than stretchblt


salt	md5---------------------------------------------------

others
if your php installation is too old even salt hash with md5 are better than two-encrypted password

using a encypted method with a salt would be even safer but this would be a good next step past just using a md5 hash

i think i understand the purpose of using sha1 as it s supposed to require more cycles than md5 to hash unhash and the salt is supposed to prevent the use of rainbow tables

please do not just a md5 better use something more secure from todays perspective and salt it properly to minimize the risk of rainbow attacks

if you care about your user s passwords at all use something more complicated than md5 and ideally you should have a salt string of some form

a construction with a salt may be md5 answer || salt where || denotes concatenation

actually you can insert the passwords as a simple md5 hash it will still work for letting the user login though it is recommended to then change the password through the front end system as the salt passwords are more secure


fancy good answers
passwords stored as md5 without a salt are much more easily cracked

it is not better than md5 plus salt

this uses pdo and prepared statements which patches the sql injection vulnerability in the most elegant way possible not mysql_real_escape_string and also uses bcrypt for hashing passwords which is infinitely better than one md5 with no salt

for the password hashing there are lots of discussions about this out also good answers on so you should probably move away from md5 and use a better salt

decode the passwords yourself and re-encode them with a salt i recommend something a little more fancy than md5


password algorithm random
an md5 encrypted password usually includes a random salt to make it more difficult to perform dictionary attacks

encrypt the passwords with one-way encryption algorithm with a random salt like the common opinionï¼š sha-256 is stronger than md5

hashing with sha md5 or any other algorithm solves the problem of key protection because you don t need to keep any secret value other than salt but salt is significantly less sensitive than encryption key

now personally i generally use a salt sha-256 hash on my passwords because i thought that md4 and md5 were no longer secure and that hashing a password multiple times would just put too much strain on a server for no practical benefit

you can md5 or encrypt for better security the client ip using a secret salt + date and pass this as a parameter in iframe src url

so md5 + strong password + average salt is better than usual password + super-extra-cool_hash and quite enough

bcrypt is considered the most secure way to implement password hashing with salt because it is slow - much slower than an md5

so md5 + strong password + average salt is better than usual password + phpass


sha256 secure
4 md5 can be made more secure by using a salt

using sha256 with a salt will be much more secure than md5


hash-collision	key---------------------------------------------------

better buckets worse
if not md5 would also be suitable for this purpose since you are concatenating the bucket and path and using the hash to provide better key distribution not uniqueness so you have no hash-collision concerns

the more hash-collision you have the worse the performance of hash maps because much of the hash maps good performance relies on as few as possible key in the same hash buckets


slower sizable different
it will only really matter if you have lots of hash-collision since then the get key call gets slower than o 1 - it gets o k with k being the number of entries in the same bucket the number of key with same hash code or a different hash code which gets still mapped to the same bucket - this depends on the capacity size and load factor of the map as well

but if your key space is vastly larger than the number of targets you ll have a sizable number of hash-collision where you ll have to check if the target stored there is really the key you re looking


others
hash code of key to make hash-collision harder to find


jqplot	flot---------------------------------------------------

others
i found jqplot easier to use with more options and better documentation than flot or graphael

bluff charts get really weird when scaled to more than 800px flot has a very limited api and the tooltips on multi axis dont work plotkit and jquery visualize doesnt have tooltips and i couldnt find any good documentation on gpraphael my best shot was jqplot which was meeting all my needs until i tried to print it on paper they print unaligned

jqplot is free in my opinion has better chart than flot it doesnâ t have events

by looking at the google groups for qjplot and flot the support for jqplot is better lot s of unanswered questions at the flot group


tooltip	scrollbar---------------------------------------------------

others
tooltip text is more scrollbar is displayed to scroll through to


vsto	add-in---------------------------------------------------

others
the comaddin base class makes it a bit easier to create an office add-in and reduce infrastructure code to be more familar with vsto - thats the whole idea

if you want to go the visual studio .net route i would recommend you look at add-in express or xldna rather than vsto both of these have less limitations than vsto

however since i know that the add-in is more or less working as is for all users some of whom use excel 2010 and some of whom use excel 2013 and some of whom may explicitly have vsto installed and some of whom may not i d like to be sure that i m not setting myself up for a bruising later on when some features of the add-in stop working for no apparent reason due to changing the setting

if you spreadsheet file has to be downloaded from server you can use epplus on server to generate spread sheet it will be much faster than vsto than you can use wcf from add-in in excel app to upload the data

vba add-in are a bit troublesome to deploy but vsto is even more so


strlen	strncpy---------------------------------------------------

bytes first last
this is the case here because strlen hello is greater than 3 your last strncpy argument

however if strlen source is greater than n then strncpy will simply copy the first n bytes and will not terminate the string dest with a null byte because there is no space for it


others
but for the example you give it doesn t matter - if it s going to fail it will be in the initial strlen so strncpy doesn t buy you anything in terms of safety and presumbly strncpy is slower as it has to both check bounds and for nul and any difference between memcpy and strcpy isn t worth changing code for speculatively


cublas	magma---------------------------------------------------

others
magma routine magma_gemm has higher performance than cublas in some cases


typo3	fluid---------------------------------------------------

others
if you are not using a fluid template take a closer look at typo3 sysext fluid classes viewhelpers uri imageviewhelper.php within your typo3 installation


uu-parsinglib	parsec---------------------------------------------------

others
uu-parsinglib is definitely worth the time to explore but i would suggest that getting familiar with parsec first is the better course for these reasons

looking briefly at the list-like combinators for uu-parsinglib i m more familiar with parsec i think you can solve this by folding over the result of the psome combinator

it seems that the idea of uu-parsinglib it to be more declarative than parsec so you just have pure


kerberos	ntlm---------------------------------------------------

secure credentials domain
but as i understand it ntlm disallows the more secure kerberos domain credentials if they re available

but since ntlm is less secure than kerberos why isn t it the other way around


ways performance better
i understand that kerberos has better performance than ntlm

in fact in some ways ntlm is better than kerberos

kerberos could be considered as a better option than ntlm


others
it seems a little bit more straight forward than kerberos but provides good ntlm sso capabilities

kerberos is complex to set up and even though it generally is considered faster than ntlm this is only true when you reach a certain limit of simultanious users on your site

if you really want to go more secure than ntlm your may want to configure kerberos

for a low traffic site the huge tokens that kerberos send across the network actually makes it slower than ntlm


hazelcast	terracotta---------------------------------------------------

others
we started with ehcache terracotta server array cause it s well-known backed by terracotta and has bigger community support than hazelcast


uilabel	uistackview---------------------------------------------------

others
in this way your uistackview would be dynamic in the sense that when the text in your uilabel gets bigger the separators on both sides would shrink


junit	jmock---------------------------------------------------

others
the later version of jmock makes things easier by integrating with the junit lifecycle as a runner

first there was a transitive dependency problem namely that of hamcrest-core 1.1 - jmock 1.1.0 - junit 3.8.1 where in maven s dependency-tree the older junit was closer to the systemtest module which was inheriting the version dependency and revision 3.8.1 of junit doesn t have contain org.junit.runner.notification.runlistener


sproutcore	cappuccino---------------------------------------------------

others
fwiw i find sproutcore to be easier to work with than cappuccino if you re interested in heavier non-progressive enhancement frameworks

like bruz says cappuccino is probably more freeform at the data layer than sproutcore


api data store
sproutcore makes use of bindings better than cappuccino currently does

sproutcore has a better data store api than the one cappuccino has


burn	prerequisites---------------------------------------------------

others
so my question is is there a way to make burn install more than one package as a prerequisites for the managed bootstrapper or is there any other way to solve this issue


wordpress	joomla---------------------------------------------------

others
while wordpress is great the simplicity of it gets the better of it joomla is far more flexible and has a huge support network and extensions library

me too don t get any advantages for joomla it s big system and it just as good as wordpress for regular projects just wordpress is much simplier

yes but if joomla is any example of how hard it is to implement a complex custom website with oop then wordpress is far easier and quicker and time is money

yes joomla takes more time in cooking the resulting html when compared to wordpress

i seem to be getting the impression that wordpress is more popular than joomla nowadays

imho creating templates for joomla is the easier than most other cms i know typo wordpress modx as you simply have to replace parts of the static version with joomla tags menu content etc. it still needs some time to get used to the system but its not that hard


common good file
looking into cms s like wordpress drupal or joomla would be a better option as compared to have it on file system although i would like to point out that those cms s are capable for more than just serving static pages

i am good at wordpress and have far more knowledge then i have regarding drupal or joomla

bigger better than wordpress you re typically looking at joomla or drupal there are others these are just the most common ones


menu better
if that will solved later than wordpress menu is better than joomla

imho wordpress is better do work and customize than joomla


nsurl	nsstring---------------------------------------------------

others
if you need the result as a string you can use the absolutestring method of nsurl it s typically better to use nsurl instead of nsstring for urls though

a lot of the time it doesn t seem to be an issue of space storing an nsstring would be more efficient if the nsurl wouldn t contain any other specific data but not to the point of making a difference in most applications


background-image	background-position---------------------------------------------------

others
instead using css you have a lot more control with background-image background-size and background-position

background-position will align a smaller photo to the bottom of a larger element but when the background photo is larger than the element it keeps the top of the background-image aligned with the top of the container


webclient	httpwebrequest---------------------------------------------------

use robust keepalive
use httpwebrequest instead of webclient it s just more robust

use httpwebrequest instead of webclient it s slightly less convenient but not by very much and set the keepalive property to false


others
you can also use webclient which is much simpler than httpwebrequest but in order to set a cookiecontainer you ll need to derive from webclient and override the protected getwebrequest method

as far as i understood webclient inherits httpwebrequest providing more simply way to code

would using webclient be more reliable or is it the same as using httpwebrequest -something like below

also i think the webclient class is more idiomatic these days than hand rolling httpwebrequest

if that is the issue you ll probably need to refactor to use the httpwebrequest and httpwebresponse classes instead on webclient and configure a more reasonable timeout

so simply httpwebrequest is better option then webclient

webclient has a much simpler interface than httpwebrequest and takes care of reading and writing from the streams for you

i recently just finished a web app using asp.net mvc 4.0 and i ran into some limitations while using webclient instead i opted for httpwebrequest which gave me more options to fine tune my requests

i d rather use webclient because it requires less code than httpwebrequest httpwebresponse


level lower bit
if httpwebrequest response are lower level then webclient what can i accomplish with httpwebrequest response that i cannot accomplish with webclient

httpwebresponse and httpwebrequest are a little bit lower level than webclient


slower higher milliseconds
because webclient is higher class of httpwebrequest and its slower

using webclient is potentially slightly on the order of a few milliseconds slower than using httpwebrequest directly


easier control powerful
webclient is easier but httpwebrequest is more powerful and allows for more control

while webclient may appear to be easier to use than httpwebrequest it is less flexible and will automatically perform it s callback on the ui thread and if you re downloading files in the background you almost certainly don t want this


vtk	itk---------------------------------------------------

others
i am more familiar with vtk than itk so propably what comes into my mind is a bit biased


gdi	directwrite---------------------------------------------------

others
i suspect that they re bypassing gdi and using something more direct like the new directwrite and or direct2d apis


facebook	fbconnect---------------------------------------------------

others
i m not familar with the facebook api but the fbconnect success looks more like an objective-c selector instead of a url


cloudant	couchdb---------------------------------------------------

others
due to many improvements to couchdb and that cloudant has more features than vanilla couchdb my suggestion would be to use a c++ http library to communicate with cloudant

regarding cloudant it s more or less just couchdb so to connect you can use these libraries from the couchdb wiki

proper handling of the last case is more complicated under cloudant and probably couchdb 2.0 due to its totally broken quorum handling but that s a different topic.


powerpc	i386---------------------------------------------------

others
to facilitate building of universal binaries we ve modified the cflags and cxxflags to include -arch i386 -arch powerpc when compiling wrapper code ogre3d itself already seems to be an universal binary

on i386 the dyld stub is much faster than the powerpc equivalent so we didnâ t bother doing extra work to bypass it


gsap	velocity.js---------------------------------------------------

others
i ve researched about the use of liquid fire and its fine but i don t quite like to have to use different syntax for the outlets and be tied down to the use of velocity.js i find better the use of gsap for the management of animations in terms of control and performance so i m wondering what kind of mechanism could i use to animate outlet transitions and above all deletion of models some kind of hook that i can make wait before the record deletion


passenger	thin---------------------------------------------------

memory better webrick
in production it is much better to use a more sophisticated server like phusion passenger or unicorn since they have better performance than thin mongrel or webrick

memory optimizations - phusion passenger uses less memory than thin and unicorn


others

lapack	gsl---------------------------------------------------

others
lapack is very low-level library and gsl may be more comfortable to use but speaking of good performance -- blas-based library it is


fullscreen	minimized---------------------------------------------------

others
the trouble is the game runs fullscreen in 800x600 resolution and really doesn t like being minimized which makes it more or less impossible to actually use ida while the game is running


background-color	transparency---------------------------------------------------

border border-radius border-color
still if you don t want the elements background-color to span more 10px because of the transparency border and you do not want to set the border-color to match the background color you can use css content property like this

you just set the div with border-radius so that it is a circle and background-color is the more transparency color in the circle


others
for example setting the background-color on a transparency element turns it black...rather than the intended color.


knitr	latex---------------------------------------------------

others
you may want to see how the default chunk hook for latex is defined in knitr to know better how the chunk hook works

you might want to use r markdown and knitr which is easier than using latex and r as also zhaoy suggested

even when latex editors support knitr their support makes working with .rnw files much clunkier than pure latex .tex files


winpcap	pcap.net---------------------------------------------------

others
pcap.net uses c++ cli to wrap winpcap which is considered more efficient than pinvoke


fileoutputstream	printwriter---------------------------------------------------

others
you need to create a fileoutputstream and decorates it with printstream or better filewriter with printwriter


wunderground	openweathermap---------------------------------------------------

others
i see that the paid version of wunderground has some higher tiers with more features but openweathermap s free tier allows a huge number of uses


vim	emacs---------------------------------------------------

everyone powerful easier
personally i m using emacs right now which i find easier than vim for searching and navigating the code but everyone has their taste

i am starting to understand that even though emacs is more powerful than vim vim is at least 10 times easier to use less keystrokes and requires way less modifications


others
and i tend to think that after a moderate amount of customisation of either one vim will still start up faster than emacs

vim was always faster to start up than emacs

i ve been using emacs for few weeks and it s been great so far - coming from vim was easier than i expected actually - emacs keyboard shortcuts feel more.

i ve used vim for 10+ years but never really into vim scripting always subjectively beliving that this was one area where vim was weaker than emacs

i m saying that on any machine out-of-the-box installs of vim will start up faster than out-of-the-box installs of emacs

since emacs is much older than the extensible vim as opposed to the relatively non-extensible vi it has a much larger collection of extension modes covering almost any purpose you can imagine

maybe not productive in the same way - i d say vim is quicker for editing files emacs is better at doing everything else again i would personally say things like flymake-mode vcs bindings are such are quicker to use than the vim equivalent

i realized that emacs would load slower than vim but this seems ridiculous for a fresh install

that said modifier keys are important in vim even if less than in emacs

on today s machines that s a non-issue but if you ever find yourself dealing with older gear it s my experience that vim is far more likely to work on a wonky terminal than emacs is

emacs is more powerful than vim it s scripting engine is far more flexible and there are far more scripts modes and the likes built around emacs

it s an emacs mode that makes emacs feel more like vim while giving you full access to the wonderful mind-boggling complexity of emacs if you ever want it

in vim it s much more difficult to run a subprocess than it is in emacs so in vim you need to have a separate running idris repl

you might want to try emacs - it has an inbuilt tutorial and some people like me find it easier over vim no flames pls

for example emacs s macro shortcut f3 and f4 is easier than vim s qq and q

of course the emacs crowd says the same thing regarding emacs-style thinking but i gave up on learning emacs because vim was simpler and did the job for me

available on almost every platform true of vi vim too of course - whether gui- or text-based java ides are available on most platforms too but only in gui mode and are significantly larger and need to be installed separately whereas emacs is generally more widely available - bsd nix linux mac systems

cut and paste in vim takes more steps than in emacs iirc


editing better external
it is worth learning both because emacs is better than vim at editing certain languages and doing certain tasks and vice versa

there are definitely some advantages using external editors however emacs is ten million times better than vim


png	tga---------------------------------------------------

others
if necessary i can switch to tga though png is more convenient


freebsd	solaris---------------------------------------------------

others
both systems have large suites of available software packages available freebsd is likely larger and there s a better chance something may have been ported to freebsd over solaris depending on the niche of the package of course


lambda	first-class-functions---------------------------------------------------

others
in summary java 8 lambda are more first-class-functions than i had originally thought

to list to callbacks in c# you have delegates events and lambda that replace java listeners acting as first-class-functions and allowing a better quality of coding patterns


glut	qglwidget---------------------------------------------------

others
first of all qglwidget does everything glut does plus more


mbunit	mstest---------------------------------------------------

others
this example is in mstest but mbunit is more or less equivalent


widespread features test
i ve read time and time again that tdd test first is more difficult with mstest than it is with other testing frameworks such as nunit mbunit etc.

nunit is more widespread mbunit has the most features but mstest has more manpower behind it


orika	dozer---------------------------------------------------

small different collections
i tested orika and it was a lot faster but was slower than dozer with small collections

i know that orika and jmapper are great libraries from google and they use reflection in a different way than for example dozer which is much slower they se reflection to generete code somehow

orika is way faster than dozer and quite close to manual mapping


others
performance will depends on your application use cases basically orika perform better than dozer or other mapping reflection based frameworks because it use bytecode generation behind the scenes


d3.js	canvasjs---------------------------------------------------

others
canvasjs is more of creating charts using canvas element of html5 and d3.js uses svg


uiviewcontroller	uipageviewcontroller---------------------------------------------------

others
the code you presented will never pass more than one uiviewcontroller to the uipageviewcontroller


filesystems	fat---------------------------------------------------

others
actual mounting of filesystems is trickier business and really depends on what you are mounting - ntfs fat ext3 xfs nfs cifs webdav etc etc

since the filesystems is more than likely fat or fat32 protecting it permission based way would be more convoluted

i d suggest to check the documentation of your filesystems regarding maximum file size but most modern filesystems don t have such low limits that 2gb 4gb applies to fat and some other old filesystems that are no longer broadly in use on servers

granted fat is an easier problem but they claim to support many filesystems and it would be my first choice

as far as i know almost all filesystems support larger files than that a notable exception is of course fat 32

most modern filesystems are also considerably more complex than fat which would add further difficulty to the implementation


accelerometer	gyroscope---------------------------------------------------

others
i want to use accelerometer but i learnt that gyroscope is better option to calculate the accelerometer

the gyroscope will give a beter indication on movement then the accelerometer

gyroscope consumes more power than accelerometer based on my analysis its 4-6 times higher


function magnetometer sensors
some of people says that i have to use not just accelerometer sensor use more sensors such as gyroscope or magnetometer

so after googling this i found that using gyroscope sensor is more accurate than the accelerometer

also i have tried the accelerometer sensor and it worked but i m asking to check whether the gyroscope is more accurate to this function or the accelerometer


lift	wicket---------------------------------------------------

others
lift s ajax support is far less verbose than wicket s


qtableview	qtablewidget---------------------------------------------------

others
the qtablewidget is slightly easier to implement than the qtableview which also needs a qtablemodel as backend but it has less capabilities

qtableview was more faster about 30 sec than qtablewidget about 1.5 min but solution with qtablewidget was easer

after managing to get my connection and pull data from the database i read that using qtableview as opposed to qtablewidget would be better for what i am trying to achieve


maven-antrun-plugin	maven-wagon-plugin---------------------------------------------------

others
instead of maven-antrun-plugin it is better to use upload goal of maven-wagon-plugin


fancybox	thickbox---------------------------------------------------

others
i m using facebox and fancybox both smaller than thickbox


icmp	udp---------------------------------------------------

others
in fact icmp especially the ttl excceeding message has even less limitations than udp on nats for the error message can be sent from every corner of the internet and routers with nat cannot be aware that these messages are not the true ones

an icmp packet has a header that is 20 bytes and is probably going to be slightly slower than udp

mere algorithm has something to do with ttl on udp packets old school and icmp echo in newer implementations


hlsl	glsl---------------------------------------------------

others
generally speaking passes in higher-level shader material systems yes higher than glsl cg hlsl like this one are a way of setting up states necessary for multi-pass rendering

opengl is better for playing around and experimenting because you can easily draw triangle without messing with hardware buffers available on larger selection of platforms plus glsl is better than hlsl because it doesn t compile into assembly


range	min---------------------------------------------------

others
for ease of debugging i pass the value of to reactive values and print the first date range s value to the console rendered to check whether the it is smaller or bigger than the min and max of the corresponding date column as i did in the lapply function

but the random number is always lower than the min number isn t inside the range i don t know why.

the new randomint takes min and max which defines the range the parameters are exclusive so the range is covered better

it may look odd but it is common for number-to-string functions in many programming languages to make an exception for the min value in this way because with two s complement representation of integers the max value is 1 less than the absolute of the min value range of -2 147 483 648 to +2 147 483 647 which means the min value is the only negative value you can t flip to positive and then process using the same shared loop code as for the positive values.

if max and min are independent variables the extra subtraction for max-min will waste time but if that expression can be precomputed at compile time or if it can be computed once at run-time to test many numbers against the same range the above expression may be computed efficiently even in the case where the value is within range if a large fraction of values will be below the valid range it may be faster to use because it will exit early if value is less than min

the code below works perfectly but it takes more than 10 min to loop through all named range

issue here is i need to submit myform but because of min max attribute i get this tip value must be less than or equal to 20 or value must be greater than or equal to 10 for the inputs submitted lesser or greater than the range provided in min and max attributes respectively because of this my form does not get submitted

while using md-slider from angular-material if the range of max and min is less then the slider is looking fine

but if i take it out of range for more than 1 min it gives an exception

with range autofilter and worksheetfunction min methods code gest shorter with neither loops nor variables to be declared

if your range were sorted in some manner then you could look at the extreme ends if the end s min is greater than the targetmax then say look at the range 1 4 backwards from the end etc.

i know that in general for a set of range if the max of the mins is less than the min of the maxes than they intersect but the circular nature of degrees makes this a bit more complicated

i see that you used the revised query with range predicates instead of in predicates and that this query now runs in a mere 39 s compared to 15 min --- either because the range predicates are evaluated more efficiently than the in predicates or because as martin indicated a later run of the query benefits from indexes that where automatically built by monetdb when evaluating the first query or because of both

so if the range is sufficiently large other methods can definitely beat min by requiring less function calls

my query is given below so based on the date range first i have to sort down the records after that i have no idea how to find the difference between created_at and updated_at having status success and the time difference is less than 5 min 5 to 15 and so on

any value in the disjointed range that is less than the value in d1 has 1e+99 added to it and that won t be the min of anything

figuring out the necessary exponent range is much more straightforward if you can describe the max and min possible absolute values of your input you can easily find suitable corresponding binary minimum and maximum exponent

keysin returns all keys in the range of and min get the lower bound


return different size
grid min value should be either 0 or a nice value lower than the min value of the data in range

if you want to check that a number is between the min and max of the range you would likely want to check that it is both higher than the min and lower than the max

take a look at your picture - all the range you want have ending time greater than min and starting time less than max

the whenever clause is required in this case to prevent min values being higher than the max values and to ensure that the range size does not exceed the capacity of an int

i m working on slider that updates 2 text boxes with values the slider is in a limited range so it doesn t give values lower higher than min max

check the the min value of this range is lower than the ip

to randomize output at resulting array select a number greater than min and less than n to create a random number within a specific range

the question i have is i would like the calendar to only display the min and max date range for the from date and to date any thing greater than the max and anything less than the min should be greyed out

whenever the lower range is set higher than the upper range the upper range automatically changes value and min attribute to match the lower range value

produces the same error attributeerror max must be larger than min in range parameter

i would like to know if there is a way to access the range of said shader properties so that i can set a max and min value to my sliders

also consider that you are looking for the min date and if the partition function has range that include more than 1 date value then even if the optimizer narrowed down the specific partition rather quickly it would still need to scan the entire partition because you don t have an index defined on that date field

workaround is to use a value lower than the min value in range -2065 here or you can also use -1e9 to have a shorter string

however i m getting a attributeerror max must be larger than min in range parameter. error when i m trying to plot the normalized data

range is 5000 to 50000 what i want to achive is in maxpoint select box i want to display the values which are greater than min points selected value

i want to make sure that the user does not enter a zero for the max value and also that the min value is less than the max value not equal to but less than - i need the range of values max - min

if you look how floating point numbers are implemented they can t represent all numbers between their max and min as the number of real numbers in a range is bigger than infinite

and during sometime i have a range where min and max is less than 1 and greater than 0

now you can see in the product.rb i want to fetch the product based on the price so that in the with_min_range the result will be the products whose variants minimum price range will be greater than the value of min

if range is greater then or less then the min and max then it should throw error

ie the range includes min but excludes max and values greater than max or less than min wrap around in a circle

a larger range means a greater max value and a smaller min value than decimal

main problem why i cant adopt those solution is that every of my random values has different range and i need the values to be uniformly distributed withing the range no frequency occurances at min max for example which happens if i cut off the values which are less greater than min max

age can be in the range of 0..100 but i want also to validate crossing values i mean that max is greather than or equal to min

the max value of a range must be greater than or equal to the min

here is a dynamic solution that works for any range of numbers where min is less than max

but continuing i always got attributeerror max must be larger than min in range parameter

the dis min max part sets a range of min and max values this distribution can come up with which means it will never generate a value bigger than max or smaller than min

to return a random integer equal or greater than min smaller or equal to max with chance probability of the result to equal x and 100-chance probability spread uniformly among all other results in the given range

in general you want to have a range slightly larger than x max - x min and then divide the range into the desired number of bins

to create equal bins you can simply first define a min and max value which is slightly smaller than both range

it looks like the default calulation of the range slider is min + max - min 2 or min if max is less than min

so just calculate how many bits you need range.bitlength may be useful check if randomized value is in specified range so if value is greater than range random again if everything is ok return randomized value increased by min

if min is bigger than max i just return a random character from the entire range


fileinputstream	fileoutputstream---------------------------------------------------

others
at first i tried reading the original pdf with a fileinputstream and finding the signature hex strings to split it into smaller files with a fileoutputstream as i have done with jpgs


cut	dash---------------------------------------------------

others
the smaller the dash symbol is the better results you will get the existing api code doesn t seem to cut off the symbol at the final vertex of a polyline segment and doesn t seem to account for the section of the symbol that went past the polyline after the vertex


qobject	qscopedpointer---------------------------------------------------

others
mind that qscopedpointer or std unique_ptr will always work deterministic but qobject destroyed signal doing deferred release via qobject deletelater is more prone to surprises starting from when exactly the object gets released


ant	eclemma---------------------------------------------------

others
also forgot to mention junit testing framework and a great eclipse plugin eclemma for code coverage much better than cobertura ecobertura and easier to use and of course you can try maven as the other post mentionned or try ant as build tool


bmp	pgm---------------------------------------------------

others
i used ppm pgm files as they are simpler to write and more portable than bmp


onclick	onmousedown---------------------------------------------------

others
edit i just found out that text selection is done before onclick is fired a better option is onmousedown

sometimes it is good practice to use onmousedown event instead of onclick because onmousedown is fired sooner so ga script has more time to execute event tracking it s only a few milliseconds difference but can help


plot	heatmap---------------------------------------------------

others
for heatmap and correlation statistical analysis based plot i have had more luck with seaborn than with matplotlib

i success in plotting distance with points but i need more visual plot with heatmap

i tried to do this with a heatmap but the data plot was worse that way due to the large gaps between samples

note that this relies on image rather than heatmap as the latter offsets the plot making it more difficult to put text in the correct position

it also allows you to use an interpolated shading mode which will make your plot look more like a typical heatmap


fgets	strtod---------------------------------------------------

others
reading a line of numbers spaced with white-space except n and then finally terminated with n is possible with scanf and ungetc but not worthy of coding except as an exercise as using fgets and sscanf strtod is far better


lapack	openblas---------------------------------------------------

others

routines native linux
it seems that openblas routines are slower than native blas and lapack

if you are on linux and have chosen blas and lapack from a repo it is very likely that they are much slower than openblas


multiplying	transpose---------------------------------------------------

others

matrices non-zero boost
apparently transpose a matrix then multiplying it is faster than just multiplying the two matrices

while your original matrix may contain only 3348026 non-zero elements keep in mind that multiplying the matrix with its transpose may yield a more densely populated resultant matrix

this seems too deep in the original code so i won t touch it but if there s any possibility of flattening the stored array it will be a speed boost even if you can t transpose it multiplying add dereference is faster than dereference add dereference


quicksort	mergesort---------------------------------------------------

others
i had been taught that quicksort is almost always quicker than mergesort and i understand that there is some debate on this topic but i at least expected it to be closer than this

quicksort is also more complicated than mergesort especially if you want to write a really solid implementation and so if you re aiming for simplicity and maintainability merge sort becomes a promising alternative with very little performance loss

that s hard to say.the worst of mergesort is n log2n -n+1 which is accurate if n equals 2 k i have already proved this .and for any n it s between n lg n - n + 1 and n lg n + n + o lg n .but for quicksort its best is nlog2n also n equals 2 k .if you divide mergesort by quicksort it equals one when n is infinite.so it s as if the worst case of mergesort is better than the best case of quicksort why do we use quicksort

one can implement a version of quicksort for a single-linked list but normally this is only interesting as a puzzle since mergesort is much easier to implement and works equally well or better for sorting linked lists

the biggest difference that can be produced between the two of them will always be to quicksort s detriment and it involves lists that are already largely sorted or contain a large number of ties when quicksort does better than mergesort the difference will not be nearly so great

quicksort has better locality of reference than mergesort which means that the accesses performed in quicksort are usually faster than the corresponding accesses in mergesort

the benefit of mergesort is the guaranteed o n log n run time where as quicksort can be much worse in the event of poor pivot point sampling

quicksort is more sensitive to input sortedness in a positive way than mergesort

mergesort is more natural to implement for linked lists but you can do quicksort very nicely

this means that while the two underlying sorts it uses mergesort and insertion sort are both worse than quicksort for many kinds of data timsort only uses them when it is advantageous to do so

quicksort is generally regarded as mutable and may therefore be less useful in a functional setting but mergesort is generally better suited for a functional setting

i do know though that quicksort has more compares but less swaps than mergesort which i learned from another stackoverflow discussion quicksort vs merge sort

it turns out that if comparisons are cheap mergesort tends to run a little faster because quicksort spends more time fiddling with pointers

also depending on radix sort s radix size its constant factor may be larger than quicksort s mergesort s log factor

also note that quicksort is generally more optimal than mergesort see this as well which explains why it s taken advantage of when sorting primitives


comparisons number efficient
interestingly quicksort performs more comparisons on average than mergesort - 1.44 n lg n expected for quicksort versus n lg n for mergesort

mergesort uses about 30 less comparisons than quicksort

purely in terms of the number of comparisons performed is mergesort always more efficient than quicksort


better simpler parallelizing
quicksort is implemented well it is typically 2-3 times faster than mergesort or

quicksort is not better than mergesort

it s because that quicksort is generally faster that people use it instead of mergesort

parallelizing mergesort is simpler than quicksort in-place

scenarios when quicksort is worse than mergesort

i ve looked at the question at why is quicksort better than mergesort

why is quicksort better than mergesort

i would say that the quicksort is simpler for parallelizing than the mergesort

previously discussed on so why is quicksort better than mergesort

quicksort usually is better than mergesort for two reasons

is quicksort always better than mergesort


faster algorithm heapsort
typically mergesort is slower than heapsort and quicksort but that s usually under the assumption that comparisons are fast

normally quicksort is faster than mergesort which is faster than heapsort

quicksort generally runs faster than mergesort but under some circumstances it can degrade to quadratic running time

the quicksort algorithm is faster than mergesort which is what sorted will get you when called on a sequence of objects via java.util.arrays.sort

i have been testing the practicality of openmp gnu parallel sort algorithms in the c++ standard library and have found the parallel quicksort algorithm to be significantly slower than the mergesort algorithm

from what i ve read i was expecting quicksort to be faster than mergesort but on my code it is not so i assume there must be a problem with my quicksort algorithm

mergesort is slightly slower than quicksort but it does not have quicksort s susceptibility to pathological cases

quicksort is usually faster than mergesort just because it s easier to code a tight implementation and the operations it does can go faster

although quicksort runs in quadratic time as compared to mergesort which runs in linear-log time quicksort is usually faster in practice

worst case for quicksort is actually worse than heapsort and mergesort but quicksort is faster on average

i have read that quicksort is much faster than mergesort in practise and the reason for this is the hidden constant

mergesort - in general mergesort is consistently faster than quicksort however quicksort is done in place and doesn t require allocating memory unlike mergesort

quicksort is a partitioning sorting algorithm you might refer to mergesort which also is a partitioning sorting algorithm the biggest difference is probably the speed quicksort is faster even though both of them are o n log n

for the 10 tests on the same list the results should be quite the same at least all showing that quicksort is faster than mergesort or vice vesa

depending on where i look people say quicksort is faster than mergesort due to its locality of reference cache hits etc

however on smaller int sizes quicksort gets slower and mergesort gets faster

for 5 000 000 ints still stored in memory quicksort becomes suddenly worse then heapsort and mergesort

quicksort is approximately 40 faster than mergesort on random data because of fewer data movements

as many people have noted the average case performance for quicksort is faster than mergesort

to be specific the quicksort runs faster than mergesort in the first test case and loses badly in the following 9 tests

it might be helpful to see why quicksort is usually faster than mergesort since if you understand the reasons you can pretty quickly find some cases where mergesort is a clear winner

i ran the two and while the quicksort was faster for smaller data sets 100 elements and i did verify that it works the mergesort became the quicker algorithm fairly quickly

in most cases quicksort will run faster than mergesort even though the worst-case execution time is longer


implementation bit odd
when comparing my quicksort implementation with std sort on my compiler and my implementation of mergesort i noticed an odd pattern on large data sets when operating on 64 bit integers quicksort is consistently faster than mergesort

when comparison function is a callback function like in quicksort libc implementation quicksort is slower than mergesort by 15 on random input and 30 for already sorted array for 64 bit integers


recursive base calls
quicksort consistently has less recursive calls than mergesort

that way quicksort can reach recursive base case more quicker than mergesort


practice typical variants
quicksort has a bad worst case while mergesort is always o n log n guaranteed but typical quicksort implementations are faster than mergesort in practice

in practice it ll take longer than quicksort which is why quicksort variants are favored over mergesort in the real world

you can also see that for smaller collections quicksort is faster but then mergesort takes the lead but all of this is case specific so take your time to study all 4 algorithms


better worst complexity
technically mergesort has a better time-behavior î nlogn worst and average cases than quicksort î n 2 worst case î nlogn average case

for instance quicksort can outperform mergesort although mergesort is provably better than quicksort in the worst case

for example locality of references has influence on cache hits or misses which is the reason why quicksort performs better than mergesort

furthermore you ll have no clue which size it is above which mergesort will perform better on quicksort s worst case arrays as this depends on implementation issues for example one compiler may compile your code in a way that the delete operation in sort4 is very costly in terms of time and so for most reasonably sized arrays sort3 might turn out to be always faster

mergesort may use more space than quicksort i m not entirely sure and merge may be better for linkedlists

i know mergesort is better since it is stable and doesn t have n 2 as worst case but i required to implement quicksort

quicksort is worse complexity than mergesort in the worst case.

an interesting answer about this can be found at why is quicksort better than mergesort

quicksort is not better it is well suited for a different kind of application than mergesort

given that it is possible to vastly reduce the likelihood of the worst case of quicksort s time complexity via random selection of the pivot for example i think one could argue that mergesort is worse in all but the pathological case of quicksort


express	koa---------------------------------------------------

others
koa middleware is much simpler and less hacky than express middleware due to the way middleware flows in a stack-like manner

personally i would recommand using express.js framework written by tj but i would not say it s the best one you might have heard koa framework but i think express would be more simple concept than it. like es6 generator function etc.

see this blog when you have 10000 request koa performs better than express

i am more familiar with express than koa but could also see it going in the entry server.js file

koa doesn t provide this kind of thing out of the box - it s designed to be a little more low level than express

i should also say that i have the token at ctx.request.get authorization koa based i think it s something like req.header authorization with express in all routes


restify application faster
it is very common to use a web application framework like express sails hapi or koa there are many more

it shows that koa is faster then other framework but as this question is about express and restify express is faster than restify


cntk	cudnn---------------------------------------------------

others
finally i don t expect to learn many meaningful lessons from this benchmark both cntk and theano are calling the same cudnn implementation the advantages of cntk are more around higher level things such as a comes with a high-level library b the user doesn t have to worry about the batch and sequence axes except for a few specialized operations c efficient recurrent networks d efficient i o e easy distributed training


cdi	facesservlet---------------------------------------------------

others
i want to use cdi with these servlets but it only works for the facesservlet to be more precisely for the beans the jsf actions are routed to


pycrypto	m2crypto---------------------------------------------------

others
i chose to rely only on pycrypto and pyopenssl since m2crypto is less popular and not well-maintained which is a hazard from both compatibility pypy and security perspectives

what little i ve used pycrypto i ve found m2crypto to be a better library overall -- you might want to try it out


openkm	alfresco---------------------------------------------------

others
i think the preview function in openkm is more well than alfresco


mayavi	matplotlib---------------------------------------------------

others
mayavi makes it easier to visualize the data but matplotlib looks more professional

mayavi might be better but i haven t tried this as i wanted to stick with matplotlib

mayavi has more options for moving the camera than matplotlib but it doesn t seem to have a way to rotate around the y axis so i m guessing i ll need to perform some complex calculations on the azimuth and elevation to achieve the same result - but i m at a loss as to where to start i m new to working in 3d space and my brain doesn t think that way yet


patch performance stuff
you could do this in matplotlib probably using patch objects to build up a cube and colour the patches as needed however for 3d plotting mayavi is generally easier better

personally i ve used mayavi in the past and found the performance much better than matplotlib for 3d scatter plotting though the python bindings are somewhat in question moving forward i think

anyway if you re willing to do advanced 3d stuff mayavi is way better than matplotlib


isotope	masonry---------------------------------------------------

resizes first better
according to this answer the isotope plugin might work better than masonry for media-queried resizes

they do this using a jquery plugin called isotope which is a more complete version of masonry you pay for

masonry was the first one and works very well and isotope is the newer version that expanded on the original thinking along with additional features like sorting


others
in its stead you can use isotope - which does filtering a lot easier than masonry


vim	geany---------------------------------------------------

others
it looks like vim is slower than geany


exif	jfif---------------------------------------------------

others
this allows older readers to correctly handle the older format jfif segment while newer readers also decode the following exif segment being less strict about requiring it to appear first


pandas	seaborn---------------------------------------------------

others
i also think working with seaborn is much easier using pandas dataframes and not numpy arrays

for similar functionality that speaks pandas but has more flexible features you could use the facetgrid object from seaborn


httphandler	httpmodule---------------------------------------------------

others
you can have only one httphandler but can plug in more than one httpmodule to examine and handle the requests

i m not sure httpmodule is still better then httphandler


gson	jackson---------------------------------------------------

faster slower parser
gson is faster with smaller documents and jackson is faster with large documents

i looked at gson metrics and it seems slower than jackson

under some conditions gson has proven to be a lot faster than jackson there also exists jsonp and json.simple

further more gson really seems to be faster than jackson json

gson is simpler jackson is faster

take a look at the jackson json parser it s faster than the one in android and faster than gson and supports streaming

large objects google gson performs faster than jackson and simple json

i ve seen questions like this come up before and the general consensus is that jackson is much faster than gson

gson 1.6 now includes a low-level streaming api and a new parser which is actually faster than jackson

personally i prefer jackson as according to test benchmarks it s faster than gson

actually genson is faster and has more features than gson and has performances close to jackson but its a lot more lightweight see

very small object google gson performs faster than jackson and simple json

according to the performance results at for serialization with databind with strings gson.tojson myobject gson is over 10x slower than jackson

deserialization performance is similar with gson over 9x slower than jackson and fastjson about 0.5 faster than jackson

in my case i found jackson little faster than gson i used default serialization because so far i don t have a need to customize serialization

code looks correct and even at its worst jackson should be no slower than gson

also i want to know if google gson is better than jackson for json parsing

jackson is faster but the api is 37x more complex than the gson api

jackson is more suitable if you have a complex deep json tree because gson creates a lot of temporary objects which leads to stop the world gcs

all in all jackson is considered to be faster but i ve also read that gson gives better performance when working with large objects


point diffrent speed
after searched in google found that jackson has better performance than gson i plan to replace gson with jackson in my project but i got a diffrent result when run test code

multiple posts on the internet point toward jackson as having better parsing performance than gson granting somewhere in the neighborhood of 20-30 speed improvement


others
although jackson s nexttoken will work like skipvalue gson seems more flexible to me

since i am more familiar with jackson here are some aspects where i think jackson has more complete support than gson apologies if i miss a gson feature

well sometimes performance and usability can be at odds but i ve found gson to be easier to use than alternatives like jackson org.json and others

no hate against gson but in my experience jackson has been more featureful and the lead dev is very good about addressing bugs feature requests

try this lib that s a good one with the jackson we use only in the server side because jackson is more slow in the android than gson at least in our test

it seems gson is more faster than jackson the average time of gson is about 2ms while jackson is about 16ms does i make mistake when using jackson

note also that gson comes with less features out of the box than genson or jackson

keep in mind though that jackson is a larger library than gson so depending on your case you might prefer gson to avoid 65k methods limitation

i recommend gson as this has small memory footpring just pull parsing is about 16k jackson is way bigger

gson is a popular choice for solving this problem however we find jackson to be more performant since it supports alternative ways of processing json streaming in-memory tree model and traditional json-pojo data binding

going to go ahead and say that gson is a lot more user friendly albeit less powerful than jackson

gson is not particularly fast but the jackson library can almost compete with most binary serializers jackson is 2-4x faster than gson in most situations and 10-20x faster on utf-8 because it has special code for utf-8


easy benchmark genson
i found jackson better than gson performance project activity better docs ...

performance of jackson is better than gson

jackson type safety is way better than gson

i m using gson for the parsing and i know jackson might give me better results

also it seems jackson lib has better performance than other packages such as gson which i haven t tried personally

you can parse it like what you are using or you can do the same with more less code and more performance by using gson as described in this answer or you can use jackson as described here

also please suggest me an open source json binder better than gson could be jackson json genson or if any other which could help me to develop fully fledged application in which application continuously hit to restful services and receives the response from the same

gson is very easy to use while jackson has better performance

we plan to use gson extensively in the application as it seems safer and better than jackson

quick takeaway of the benchmark jackson performs 5 to 6 times better than org.json and more than twice better than gson


free	realloc---------------------------------------------------

try results allocation
if you don t mind the libc allocation functions realloc is even more efficient it wont copy the data on a shrink just mark the extra memory as free and if you grow the memory and there is memory free after it will mark the needed memory as used and not copy either

if i try to use realloc to allocate less memory for a pointer than it initially had allocated will the redundant memory be free or will the reallocation result in a memory leak

i ve already tried using realloc to reallocate more memory to my array after using free but when i try to do it my results are either a unexpected shut of the execution or a lot of crazy plots..

if nfa- numstates is greater than arraysize free previous memory and realloc arrays of size nfa- numstates


better good complicated
that s why realloc can temporarily require more memory than a malloc free pair

in the case of overflow a free malloc pair costs less than realloc because of its internal hidden memcpy

as you can see from the above tests realloc is consistently faster compared to memalloc memcpy and free

dynamic memory management on an small embedded system is tricky to begin with but realloc is no more complicated than a free and malloc of course that s not what it does

you could have some initial guess for maxsize 8 and grow when needed your data perhaps by using realloc or just by malloc -ing a bigger new chunk copying the older chunk inside then free -ing that older chunk

in c you would use malloc to get memory realloc to get more memory and free to release memory

a malloc free pair can be better than a realloc if you don t need to keep around the original memory

malloc free is harder because thereâ s also calloc and realloc

if you work with data that doesn t need construction destruction and requires reallocations a large array of ints then i believe malloc free is a good choice as it gives you realloc which is way faster than new-memcpy-delete it is on my linux box but i guess this may be platform dependent

a realloc can occur significantly faster than a malloc memcpy and free

i m not saying that realloc is worse than implementing realloc using a malloc free


others
the justification of realloc is that it s faster than 2nd malloc manual copy free

if you ever need to resize the matrix you will have to either use realloc or ask for more space on the heap copy your values over and free the older memory

i know that memory blocks and reallocation are implementation so specific but when there are contiguous free blocks of memory realloc works better than a new buffer allocation and memory copy

it is important to note that realloc may extend the older block to size bytes may keep the same block and free the extra bytes or may allocate an entirely new block of memory copy the content from the older block to the newer block and then free the older block

in implementing the function copynorepeat i can not use realloc to allocate more 4 bytes of space to store a number in v2 this results in double free or corruption fasttop . i wonder why

if old is greater than new free the extra old pointers on the end before doing the first realloc so you don t leak memory


mbunit	nunit---------------------------------------------------

others
what i ended up discovering is that out of the box nunit offered more options and plug-ins such as pnunit for parallel testing and another plug-in for performance testing where xunit mbunit lacked all or some of these features

from what i have read on here i here that nunit is more popular over mbunit


mstest data offers
even though nunit now includes the most popular mbunit advanced features mbunit is still more feature-rich for example

nunit is more popular because it was there first therefore more articles about it on the web and better tooling and because most programmers don t care about or need the advanced features that mbunit offers

mbunit has compatible syntax with nunit but has more features especially data driven tests

nunit is more widespread mbunit has the most features but mstest has more manpower behind it


uitableview	uisearchbar---------------------------------------------------

others
uitableview is reporting a bigger contentsize than expected when using a uisearchbar


ant	maven---------------------------------------------------

number tool sophisticated
ant is older and while it is still used in a number of projects it is rapidly losing ground to maven

a hood technique is to tag milestone releases of your projects giving then a version number and then manage dependencies with maven or a similar tool a bit more sophisticated than ant

having said all of that i do think that maven is a very interesting and useful system i m not calling it a tool like ant is maven is broader than that for software development configuration and build management


gradle maven-centric notation
alternate build tools ant lots of configuration gradle conventions again less verbose than maven

if they are going to use any non-maven way to retrieve them ui rest scripts ant gradle then you can go with any path and name you like and you ll get full support from artifactory uploading searching etc. with nexus which is much more maven-centric you ll better stick to maven notation


respects repo excels
ant is much more powerful than maven in many respects but maven excels in dependency management and ease of deployment

but as i checked-out some example apps from spring source repo and it seems that maven is more preferred and powerful than ant


better easier tool
you get the same mechanism for other dependency managers like ivy oy gradle maven ivy ant gradle are more than just dependency managers but it s not the point here

maven is better for managing dependencies but ant is ok with them too if you use ant+ivy and build artefacts

i think updating dependencies with maven is pretty easier than dealing with ant but of course you could select the other way if you feel more conifrtable

maven is a better alternative as build system compared to ant

you can do things easily in ant that are harder to do in maven

and it turns out maven really does a better job of managing dependencies for ant build.xml files than does ivy

ant pre-dates more modern tools like maven and gradle that have this feature baked in

while i personally think maven is a better tool than ant in the long run our experience will make maven3 a better tool than maven2

it s a lot easier than ant fully compatible with eclipse use maven eclipse eclipse to create eclipse projects and easy to configure

this question is similar in nature to whether ant is better than maven or c# better than java

maven is definitely better than ant and well used for big projects

trust me i did this before for another job where the system architect decided that maven was better than ant and all of our projects must be converted from ant to maven

if you want to stick to lower level basic file operations ant is better bet than maven

i also find ant with ivy to be better documented than maven although that s not too difficult

since ant is more of a scripting tool and doesn t impose structure or lifecycle like maven and gradle you simply manually invoke ant when you want to use it

the size of maven jar is bigger then ant jar i don t know why help me please

you can take a look on gradle which for me could provide more freedom than maven but is easier to use than ant

i agree with previous answers but i would also recommend to use proper java build tool - like ant perceived easier to use but not necessary or maven perceived more difficult to use but really worth learning

can maven examine and resolve internal dependencies of non-mavenized jar library defined earlier by ant

maven definitely has better integration with flex than ant

while i won t start a war of ant vs maven maven is much more than just a build tool and that may help you in future

1 - why ant script generates more .class files than maven

however some things ant handles better than maven and if there s not a maven plugin for it it may be difficult to handle in maven

the second build can run a shell script or ant instead of maven allowing you easier control of your remote server

also forgot to mention junit testing framework and a great eclipse plugin eclemma for code coverage much better than cobertura ecobertura and easier to use and of course you can try maven as the other post mentionned or try ant as build tool

i know that ant would be better for this but i m using maven in my project

first maven is a much younger tool than ant or make so you have to expect that its going to take time to get to the maturity level of those applications


others
while ant is cool maven is cooler

also note that while maven is no slower than ant for multi-module projects of this sort importing your maven project into an ide will generally result in far faster builds than maven can perform itself

i find the simple solution ant calls maven more obvious

i guess that the maven version contains much more than the ant version

it will depend on the complexity of your builds if you have basic java builds then maven might be more suited as the pom.xml files maven build filds are pretty simple but if you need to do a lot of custom specific stuff you may well end up having ant scripts to perform also if you already have one system in place there isnt necessarily a huge advantage of swapping

the quotation you brought up just claim that maven does more than ant so that it s not fair to compare the two

maven is more of a meta-program that can use ant scripts and run your junit tests

i find the ant one much clearer than the maven one

troubleshooting the build maven is less reliable than ant especially the non-core plugins

maven is more or less an update concept of ant

maven usage is lower compared to ant but just how much lower is not really known

as you ve already said ant is more a replacement for gnu make while maven is primary a buildout dependency-management application

it is much better than ant because for most common tasks you don t have to write a complicated build.xml maven has very good defaults and it s all convention over configuration

maven is higher level than make makefile the classic c c++ build tool or ant build.xml

in maven you can define a.k.a testing.staging live etc which allow you to configure settings for different environments.all you need to specify maven about the environment for which you want the things to move and maven is capable enough to take care of this.though this can be done with ant also but i believe that maven provides more flexibility

in jacoco 0.7.9 there are jacoco ant tasks and in 0.8.0 there will be jacoco command line interface - both provide more freedom than jacoco maven plugin in specification of what should be included into report in particular can be used for arbitrary third-party jar files

did maven has achieved more then ant or ant is still alive

first of all ant is older than maven and therefore does not include core support for dependency management

maven is more like a replacement for ant

testing and support of ant code is quite expensive and integration with maven adds even more complexity

this is to learn something new but also because it seems like implementing maven within ant is less of a standard than is just pure maven.


simpler directory repository
also maven projects come with a different directory structure and seems to be doing much more than what ant does in the spring source tutorial

so i suggest you build a p2 repository can be done in ant but seems simpler in maven tycho and split the projects to several repositories

ant is simpler and older and the default just called a java project maven is newer more powerful and flexible


complex powerful
does this make ant more complex than maven

i know maven is more powerful than ant


dataoutputstream	bufferedoutputstream---------------------------------------------------

others
a bufferedoutputstream is more appropriate that a dataoutputstream imho

it will wrap the original stream in a bufferedoutputstream which is more efficient which is then wrapped into a dataoutputstream which offers additional nice features like writeint writelong and so on


webstorm	aptana---------------------------------------------------

others
if you re focussing on pure client code then i find webstorm to be an excellent javascript html ide - even better than aptana


cppcheck	coverity---------------------------------------------------

others
cppcheck may be less effective then coverity but it s sufficient for students assignments


caliburn	reactiveui---------------------------------------------------

others
personally i really like reactiveui which is fairly unusual but does make getting things right an awful lot easier than caliburn


ocaml	racket---------------------------------------------------

others
ocaml is faster than racket for most of the benchmarks on languages benchmark game


stringification	variadic---------------------------------------------------

others
it possible to do this a bit better by using variadic macros to do the stringification


cagradientlayer	calayer---------------------------------------------------

others
however i wish to use a custom calayer that uses an internal cggradient for drawing instead as this should produce smoother results than cagradientlayer see here


django	web2py---------------------------------------------------

mvc hindsight conveniences
plus moving from a php mvc framework to web2py or even django would make things easier

i prefer web2py because there are more conveniences built into the environment than offered by django but web2py is much newer than django and hindsight always makes it easier make new implementations better


others
you will get web2py working faster than either django or ror without a shadow of a doubt

i have just spent a few days playing around with web2py and really like it and i am wondering if django offers something more that i am missing out on

to answer klochner both seems quite popular but ruby is not a language that i am familiar with and django seems more heavy and complex to me than web2py

anyway the most important issue is that web2py is easier than django pylons php and rails

having said that web2py has a lower initial learning curve than django as it was specifically designed as a learning tool

web2py has more focus on simple is better than complex but django has more focus on explicit is better than implicit

and web2py is more lightweight than django rails whatever on pretty much all counts

web2py may be young but the mailing list has 2000 messages month which is similar to django and far more than turbogears


appadmin big box
as i understand it web2py supports gae better out of the box than django

django s is better web2py s appadmin is for administrators only

django is also a wonderful framework but web2py is just better in my limited experience opinion

django s admin is better and more customizable than web2py s appadmin

we thought of django but we think that is very big for our purpose and we decided that webpy or web2py is a better option

django turbo gears web2py which is better for what


better easier
i think you ll find that web2py is even easier to learn and use than rails and django

anything django does web2py does better


many-to-many	many-to-one---------------------------------------------------

others
where instead of expected many-to-one is much more complex and partially expressed many-to-many


urllib	httplib---------------------------------------------------

others
i don t know why this works i can only assume that httplib is slightly better behaved than urllib

basically - httplib is lower level while urllib is high-level


api better powerful
urllib and urllib2 are build upon httplib they are more abstract and powerful but sometimes won t fulfill your specified need about some http related operations

requests is one of the cleanest api s i ve ever seen way better than httplib + urllib + urllib2


xctest	kif---------------------------------------------------

others
kif makes ui testing really easy and useful with lots of great apis that are less complex than xctest


qlayout	qwidget---------------------------------------------------

others
instead i chose qlayout setfixedsize which made the layout adjust the fixed size of the owning qwidget effectively making it smaller when it needed to be

when you put more than one qwidget on a qt form you should always use some kind of qlayout the quickest way to fix your problem is to select all items in your form and click on the grid layout button the one with 3 x 3 small squares on top of the designer box


interrupt	wakeup---------------------------------------------------

others
wait with a timeout value can wakeup upon timeout value elapsed or notify whichever is earlier or interrupt as well whereas a sleep wakes up on timeout value elapsed or interrupt whichever is earlier


wercker	environments---------------------------------------------------

others
i made a docker image to use it with my builds of a project in wercker i did this because i thought having the require packages already installed in the environments is better than installing them in each build of my project


jms	jta---------------------------------------------------

others
you ll have to use jta if you need transactional access to more than one jms session


pickle	dill---------------------------------------------------

problems fork modules
i searched a bit and found that dill can perform better than pickle with classes but i am having problems to implement it

the fork uses dill instead of pickle to provide better serialization

cloudpickle might be a good idea for your problem as well it has better support in pickling objects than pickle not per see better than dill and you can pickle code easily as well

i think you can do exactly what you want with dill which provides better serialization than pickle

the dill module which is not in the standard library extends pickle to do even better

modules such as dill are doing a better job than pickle

dill has a better serializer that can pickle socket objects on any os and thus sending the socket object with multiprocess works in either case


others
you use pickle might fail dill is more stable

where i ve used dill to give you better serializationâ essentially dill can pickle class instances easily -- as well as most python objects

the pickle from dill will be bigger however

you may also want to have a look at dill which covers slightly more cases than pickle

however it also breaks pickle maybe not dill and is less dynamic then this approach

dill serializes the class method because there s additional functions that have been registered to dill that know how to pickle and unpickle a wider variety of objects -- you can see them in the disassembled code they start with dill.dill


pbkdf2	hash---------------------------------------------------

slower aka functions
key derivation algorithms such as bcrypt and pbkdf2 aka rfc2898derivebytes are much slower than standard hash algorithms

as a side note from what i ve read key derivation functions pbkdf2 scrypt bcrypt are considered better more secure #1 #2 than plain salt sha-1 sha-2 hash by crypto people


others
pbkdf2 is more secure than a simple hash or even a salt hash

i recommend against using pbkdf2 to derive more than the natural output size size of the underlying hash

an hmac is a better way of adding your salt and pbkdf2 is based on hmac - see below for more detail on pbkdf2 - there s a good discussion at when is it safe to use a broken hash function

key strengthening techniques such as bcrypt or pbkdf2 are generally considered better than plain hash since cracking them requires more resources

although because pbkdf2 applies your hash function a large number of times a long salt is less important than in traditional straight hashing applications. for my application i use a 32 byte random salt unique for each users account where i m hashing their password with pbkdf2

the advantage here is this membership provider uses pbkdf2 to derive the hash which is more resistant to brute force attacks given the number of rounds

a key-stretching algorithm like pbkdf2 applies a quicker hash like sha512 thousands of times typically causing the hash generation to take 1 5 of a second or so

just use pbkdf2 to make your hash directly make a 64 bit 8 byte random salt use a higher iteration count 4000-10000

in django for example passwords are hash with pbkdf2 or bcrypt but session hash use a less complex hmac and no random salt


opencv	vips---------------------------------------------------

others
this is done on an extremely large image and i feel vips might do a better job than opencv on this


jerkson	jackson---------------------------------------------------

others
this is not to say this is more official than jerkson just that there are many useful jackson extension modules that many developers are not familiar with


subtraction	modulo---------------------------------------------------

slower performance suspicious
i am a bit suspicious of the performance because modulo tends to use division which is slower than your subtraction operations

integer multiplication division and modulo are much slower than integer addition and subtraction


binary equivalent negative
multiplication division and modulo have the same precedence and they all have higher precedence than addition and subtraction

and keep in mind that the modulo has a higher precedence than addition and subtraction

with regard to implementation it also takes advantage of a bit of a non-obvious property of r precedence rules actually this is true of other languages as well such as c c++ and java namely that unary negative is higher than modulo which is higher than binary subtraction thus the calculation for is equivalent to


others
as i said this may increase the speed especially in an environment where modulo is more expensive than simple subtraction but you would want to actually benchmark it to be certain

the conditional test and subtraction is typically less expensive than a modulo especially if the sum does not frequently exceed mod

that is essentially the one case in which repeated subtraction 0 or 1 times a special case of repeated subtraction can be and commonly is but not necessarily faster than division-based modulo

as you can see modulo is about an order of magnitude slower than subtraction

the reason is that the modulo is slower than subtraction


puma	unicorn---------------------------------------------------

others
something where the app is about serving different pages you want low memory and good context switching things like preforking unicorn or running on the rubinius version of ruby with puma that makes concurrency easier to code because it will perform well with threading as opposed to something like mri with a global interpreter lock

for example it looks like unicorn is a better choice on heroku than puma

puma will tend to optimize itself by spawning more threads and its performance should range from no worse than unicorn in the pure cpu case to being vastly better than unicorn in the case of an app that sleeps a lot

it uses less resources than unicorn but has more requirements to your code it better be thread-safe because puma is a threaded server


mtu	icmp---------------------------------------------------

others
anything sent larger than the mtu with df set will result in an icmp error message being generated

what happen when icmp is disabled in an router and when packet size greater than mtu how the router fragments that packet

any device in the path of communication between the sender and receiver whose mtu is smaller than the packet will drop such packets and reply the sender with icmp destination unreachable datagram too big message containing the device s mtu


moq	fakeiteasy---------------------------------------------------

others
fakeiteasy seems to have an overall nicer syntax than moq like the strongly-typed way the former deals with passing parameters to a constructor of a faked class

btw why do you want to use fakeiteasy it looks to me less powerful than moq


jqvmap	jvectormap---------------------------------------------------

others
jvectormap comes with more pre-generated maps than jqvmap


laravel	codeigniter---------------------------------------------------

others
edit 2 what i would suggest you do is either to try to learn laravel getting cooler or codeigniter lightweigh if you have some free time

i understand that laravel is what s hot right now but i ve never played with it and am not sure if learning laravel is more time-effective vs using codeigniter which i know pretty well but just doesn t excite me any more

i am new to laravel it s good for coding but it is not much faster than codeigniter

unfortunately i m pretty sure you ll not find any packages or projects that migrates a joomla web site to laravel or maybe codeigniter which is much older than laravel

in my personal benchmarks laravel is undeniably faster than codeigniter due to lazy loading


simpler features better
if you ve been using laravel then you already know it is better than codeigniter

before i am using codeigniter but i found out that laravel is much better than codeigniter and it has a lot of features

like laravel i see has lot of classes while codeigniter has much less classes and looks simpler to read follow extend


wcat	loadrunner---------------------------------------------------

others
microsoft s free application for stress-testing wcat is underpowered and buggy but the full blown test edition goes up against products like loadrunner but is easier to use better-integrated with vs asp.net and for much less money per virtual user


glut	sdl---------------------------------------------------

others
if you re building a simple demo of a rendering mechanism glut is way better than sdl it takes care of a lot of the details that sdl would otherwise require

recently i migrated over to sdl from glut to get more control over the main loop

i have never used glut but i know that many people will say sdl is better

however if you re developing a serious application sdl is more likely to be the tool you need to use as glut abstracts more than a real application would normally want to

unfortunately there is no shader driven opengl example that i can refer to the provided examples on the glut repo and sdl only use older fixed-function rendering and don t use any shaders that i can see

glut is much more easier while many of people use sdl or sfml they re more flexible and feature-full than glut


express	geddy---------------------------------------------------

others
geddy is not better than connect express the big thing that differs is the structure of it


flex	osmf---------------------------------------------------

others
flex uses an older less capable version of the osmf platform for its videoplayer


datagridcomboboxcolumn	datagridtemplatecolumn---------------------------------------------------

others
it works perfectly when i use datagridcomboboxcolumn but i d like to use datagridtemplatecolumn to add some more features in future


jar	.war---------------------------------------------------

others
if you put the jar to lib folder write the ant code to exclude the jar for the .war file


caliburn.micro	reactiveui---------------------------------------------------

others
imho any modern mvvm-framework like catel caliburn.micro mvvmlight reactiveui is much better than prism


onkeyup	onkeydown---------------------------------------------------

others
for browsers that don t support either event you can fall back to onkeydown with a 0ms timer for the check which is a little better than onkeyup

usually onkeydown is more preferable then onkeyup for such combo


filewriter	printwriter---------------------------------------------------

others
printwriter is more effective than filewriter and filewriter is needed anyhow but this will work also if you want to do multiples people then just for-loop it and dont forget to close

you need to create a fileoutputstream and decorates it with printstream or better filewriter with printwriter


antialiasing	transparent---------------------------------------------------

others
and it seems working fine antialiasing is much better however this beats the idea of a transparent background in the process

minus doesn t truly work for antialiasing less than 100 transparent pixels

primitives such as rectangles and images will be antialiasing by adding more vertices along the edge of the primitives so that the edges fade to transparent


magento	expressionengine---------------------------------------------------

others
thinking you can format magento blocks any better in a cms such as expressionengine and use magento just for the backend will put you on a hiding to nothing to end up with a fairly useless setup that isn t going to go anywhere


jlabel	jsplitpane---------------------------------------------------

others
note that the jsplitpane will become no smaller than the panel s minimum size managed by the enclosed jlabel


solaris	aix---------------------------------------------------

others
the platforms that use struct sockaddr inside struct ifreq also have an ipv6 friendly version struct lifreq that uses struct sockaddr_storage instead for example solaris other platforms such as linux and aix already use the longer structure

it is compiled on windows and unix systems including somewhat more exotic platforms like aix zlinux solaris and hpux


pdfsharp	itext---------------------------------------------------

others
as noted in the comment by quandary the pdfsharp library offers a more relaxed license mit compared to the commercial or agpl license offered by itext


swing	windowbuilder---------------------------------------------------

others
in my opinion swing is easier to start because there are tools like the eclipse windowbuilder which enables you to create your application in a graphical interface but javafx is more likely to be used in the future because it has some great improvements over swing like css skins etc.


istanbul	lcov---------------------------------------------------

others
istanbul has more complete coverage stats not just lines - branches etc and can export to lcov for tools like code climate


ostringstream	std---------------------------------------------------

others
on ideone the ostringstream is about 3 times slower than std copy + back_inserter + std vector and about 15 times slower than memcpy into a raw buffer


yesod	happstack---------------------------------------------------

others
for the most part i think the choice of snap vs yesod vs happstack is less an issue of features and more one of personal taste


force.com	salesforce---------------------------------------------------

others
consider using force.com canvas now ga which is an added-value iframe with more security and easier integration with salesforce apis than raw iframes - see


wildfly	undertow---------------------------------------------------

others
from the wildfly console i understand that the undertow subsystem is receiving more or less 20 requests per second and using the application in chrome i see the requests pending for more than 30 seconds

i m working on a wildfly swarm project using wildfly swarm version 2017.8.1 maven 3.5.0 openjdk 1.8.0_141 where users will often upload files way bigger than undertow s default 10485760 bytes 10mb max-post-size setting


pthreads	epoll---------------------------------------------------

others
most particular platforms restrict the list of calls that can be interrupted to a smaller set than pthreads allows so you d have to look at the linux docs to be sure exactly what is and isn t eintr-safe but the epoll family of methods along with read recv write send and friends are almost certain to be unsafe


codeigniter	kohana---------------------------------------------------

chance similar time
you had a better chance with kohana 2.3.4 as it was derived from codeigniter and was similar

and a thing about codeigniter i asked some time ago people about it and most says that kohana based on codeigniter is better


others
i ve came to kohana from codeigniter which was a little bit bigger documentation and easier to understood but as far as i found out many programmers say that kohana are alot better than codeigniter

is the assumption that codeigniter modules work in kohana or at least can be massaged to without too much effort or is it just that kohana s got fewer modules

in kohana for example also codeigniter but kohana is more flexible you can build internal requests with

but if codeigniter has a bit too much bloat for you maybe you can try kohana which is a bit less bloated than codeigniter started as a fork

overall kohana is more flexible than codeigniter and a great base to build a web application and api on

the documentation sucks but it s very lightweight there s a good community even on so it s more simple than symfony and more powerful than codeigniter the first version of kohana was based on codeigniter


jasmine	mocha---------------------------------------------------

others
update after the answer it seems as though mocha might work more easily than jasmine

i liked cucumber and jasmine too but i think yadda and mocha are more flexible


nsoperation	nsprogress---------------------------------------------------

others
but i ve had difficulty implementing this it seems as though nsprogress is meant more for long operations that execute all their code on one background thread but have separate sections that make it easy to determine when progress has been made if this is the case then the use of the term suboperation is a bit misleading as it brings to mind the use of nested nsoperation


scons	qmake---------------------------------------------------

others
as a side note i tried qmake for a while but found scons to be much more versatile
