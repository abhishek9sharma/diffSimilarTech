forms, submission, onsuccess, ---------------------------------------------------

submission,better,event,forms
also note that for form submission it is typically better to use the onsubmit event as opposed to the onclick event since forms can technically be submitted by hitting the enter key as well as clicking the submit button

onsuccess,form,better
it s just a supposition but try recreating the form widget onsuccess or even hide the form onsubmit actually onclick is better and show another form to the user

dom, reliable, button, ---------------------------------------------------

scripts,dom,event,listener,form,reliable,button
you can indeed execute scripts on almost any page using content scripts that can manipulate the dom allowing you to add an onsubmit event listener to a form more reliable than onclick on a button as it is fired however the form is submitted - hitting enter

first,button,event,validation,user,form,better
edit to answer your question in comment bellow at first i thought i will bind it to button onclick event but to keep validation that is handy in this case when some questions aren t answered it notices the user about it i think form s onsubmit will be better

search,use,h,commandlink,better,solution
an online search for the use of onsubmit with h commandlink indicated that onclick would be a better choice and this allowed a solution to our primary problem
