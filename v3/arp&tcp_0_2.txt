check,netdiscover,lower,level,udp,apps
if you are using linux check out netdiscover this uses arp i think arp is lower level than tcp udp and with java you can only create apps from tcp udp and above

period,message,shorter,time
it would appear from your question that the period of the tcp message is shorter than the arp refresh time
