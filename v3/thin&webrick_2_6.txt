slower, performance, better, ---------------------------------------------------

slower,mongrel
from my experience webrick is slower than mongrel is slower than thin

better,performance,mongrel
in production it is much better to use a more sophisticated server like phusion passenger or unicorn since they have better performance than thin mongrel or webrick

personal,experience,faster,development,environment,unicorn,os,big
my personal experience is that webrick is faster in my development environment than unicorn and thin os x in a pretty big rails app lots of gems routes etc

use,easier,ssl
3 use thin instead of webrick - thin seems easier to configure for ssl

web,server,gem,faster,default
i also found that installing thin as your rails web server c gem install thin will perform much faster than the default webrick server

calls,nothing,longer,ms
i was getting 0.5 reqs s on the front page of my rails app a very simple mostly static page that made a couple of database calls but nothing that webrick said took longer than 0.8 ms served with thin
