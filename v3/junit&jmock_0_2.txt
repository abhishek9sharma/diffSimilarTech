dependency,hamcrest-core,maven,older,closer,systemtest,revision,org.junit.runner.notification.runlistener
first there was a transitive dependency problem namely that of hamcrest-core 1.1 - jmock 1.1.0 - junit 3.8.1 where in maven s dependency-tree the older junit was closer to the systemtest module which was inheriting the version dependency and revision 3.8.1 of junit doesn t have contain org.junit.runner.notification.runlistener
