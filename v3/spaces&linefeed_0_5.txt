rogue,future,obvious
then the rogue linefeed or maybe in future spaces will be more obvious

vertical,whitespaces,carriage,returns.
s will match more than just spaces because it also matches vertical whitespaces like linefeed carriage returns.

text,single,row,cr,wc,-c
it makes minimal change to the text in particular it never splits a word doesn t change wc -w and for text with no more than single spaces in a row and no cr it doesn t change wc -c because it replaces spaces with linefeed rather than inserting linefeed

linux,method,sense,easier
it seems like the linux method just using linefeed makes a lot more sense saves spaces and is easier to parse

regex,single,contiguous,individual,tabs
this regex does replace by a single spaces all contiguous spaces 2 or more followed by a linefeed or individual tabs
