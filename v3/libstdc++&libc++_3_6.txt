ndk, libc++abi, llvm, ---------------------------------------------------

c++11,clang,newer,gcc
if you want to use c++11 you either need to use clang with libc++ or install a newer gcc to get a newer libstdc++

standard,libraries,libc++abi,unchanged,pnacl
note that there s much more than llvm and clang these compilers also rely on c++ standard libraries both have libc++ libc++abi mostly unchanged pnacl used to support libstdc++ c standard libraries both have musl pnacl also has newlib bionic some form of glibc compiler runtime compiler-rt linker and general user libraries such as sdl part of emscripten and for pnacl in webports

ndk,gnu,llvm,stable,standard
in crystax ndk both gnu libstdc++ and llvm libc++ are much more stable and fully conforming to c++ standard at least at the same level as they conform to it on gnu linux

others---------------------------------------------------

complete,gnu,real,advantage
libc++ is not 100 complete on gnu linux and there s no real advantage to using it when libstdc++ is more complete

links,preferred,standard,clang,complete,newest,gcc
the above links to libc++ which is the preferred c++ standard library for mac os x with clang and a lot more complete than libstdc++ even when considering the newest gcc

former,default
libstdc++ does this a lot more than libc++ and the former is the default library for llvm-g++ gcc llvm the latter for clang apple llvm which means a lot of errors will seem to go away when you switch to gcc llvm or just stick with apple llvm and switch your library but your code is still wrong
