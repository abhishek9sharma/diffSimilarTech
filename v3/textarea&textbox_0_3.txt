original,project,currency,description,chekcbox
in my original project there is more than one textbox for currency description textarea chekcbox etc

simple,html,complicated
i know how to remove text in a simple html textbox but html textarea seem much more complicated

offline,changed,longer,condition
edit 3 added a message to warn the user when he s been put offline + changed textbox to colored textarea to allow for longer messages + condition to clear the messagebox so that the warning message doesn t go in the conversation
