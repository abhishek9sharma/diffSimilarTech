slower, faster, ---------------------------------------------------

slower
doing it with mouse is much more slower than it can be done with keyboard

faster
the keyboard is almost always faster than the mouse

easier, better, windows, ---------------------------------------------------

thing,easier,windows
the only thing i can think of that is easier with the mouse than with the keyboard is resizing windows

better,easier
essentially you want the mouse to be an option but the keyboard to be a better easier more convenient one

hand, close, good, ---------------------------------------------------

ctrl,close,hand,combination,faster,page
the ctrl key is usually close by my keyboard hand and in combination with the mouse is faster than the page up page down keys

menu,bar,shortcuts,good,idea,hand,slower
there is an addon that can even remove the menu bar Ã¢ you ll need to learn keyboard shortcuts this is a good idea anyway moving a hand to from the mouse is much slower

others---------------------------------------------------

developers,cli,shurtcuts,faster,setup
for other readers not satisfied i ll tell my story before you read you must know i m that type of developers who love using the cli and thinks that keyboard shurtcuts are faster than using a mouse if you don t agree may be this setup is not for you

similar,process,mistaken,easier
i want to do it with the mouse as well but i imagine it will be a very similar process and i think but i might be wildly mistaken that starting with the keyboard will be easier

difficult,typing,program,background,time,press,specific
since clicking the mouse is significantly more difficult for me than typing i was wanting to make a simple program that would just run in the background and click the mouse for me any time i press a specific key on the keyboard

ctr,cmd,better,right,thing
it recommends using ctr cmd + 1 to use the keyboard this is much better than having to use the mouse but i m still looking for a just do the right thing most of the time automatic solution

fallback,snail,red,close,window,button,movements,slower,shortcut
the last fallback is to go the snail way - to mouse over to click on the red close window button but any mouse movements are slower than a keyboard shortcut

noticeable
in general it s more noticeable with mouse than keyboard

laptop,external,kb,time,pro,larger,monitor,better
if you plan on working off of the laptop by itself without external mouse kb monitor more than 60 of the time than the macbook pro with it s larger keyboard and monitor would be better suited

function,element,accessible,need,shortcut,keydown
i am trying to make the function that is triggered when that element is clicked with the mouse be more accessible so that you don t need to only use your mouse but also a keyboard shortcut - so to trigger it on keydown - ie

name,completion,faster
i prefer the command line because i have a shell window open in the source anyway to run builds and tests and along with file name completion using the keyboard is faster than using the mouse for me

tabindex,attribute,action,arrow,box,value,detailed,explanation
ie ignores the changed tab order when the select box value which triggers the change to the tabindex attribute is changed by some keyboard action arrow keys but does not ignore the tabindex change when the select box value is changed with the mouse see more detailed explanation


for example do you use keyboard more than mouse

first,tabs,media,remote,larger,settings
the first issue i am not sure how to solve is that i wish for the first three tabs keyboard media remote and mouse to be larger than the settings tab which i will change to an icon if possible

controls,matter,control,stage
and then all your users are relying on your left right controls no matter whether they re using a mouse or the keyboard which gives you more control over how it looks at each stage

radical,concept,slower,shortcuts
this is a radical concept i know but the mouse is slower than keyboard shortcuts

dropdown,menu,accessible
i need to change my dropdown menu which works well with a mouse but i would like to make it more accessible with keyboard

page,button,fine,time,load
but when i press page down button from keyboard it works fine but when i scroll using mouse takes bit more time to load data and scrollbar of gridview displays abnormal

good,events,keylistener,e.consume,glasspane
your idea is good but have to consume events came from keyboard add there keylistener only with e.consume because glasspane to consume only mouse events

input,essential,important,interaction
also in this case keyboard input is essential and more important than mouse interaction

interface,callback,player,type,letters,better,main
since this structure is not exactly related to game logic and technically it can then be reused by implementing an interface for the callback so that you can use this keyboard elsewhere where you want to have your player to type letters using mouse it s better be separated from main logic
