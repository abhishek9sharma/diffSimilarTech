correct,better
if everything is correct why keras perform so much better than lasagne

result,comparison,worse
as a result of this comparison i see that lasagne is performing so much worse than keras that i m starting to doubt about my code

similar,spirit,high-level,api,main,difference,backend,theano
it is similar in spirit to keras which is built as a high-level api on top of theano tensorflow cntk although the main difference is that lasagne implements only one backend allowing it to integrate more deeply with theano features
