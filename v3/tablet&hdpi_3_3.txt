whats,galaxy,lower,pixel,xxhdpi,density,image,512px,android,xhdpi,device
in your case whats happening is that your galaxy tablet has a lower pixel density and android down-scales the image from a xxhdpi to whatever density the tablet has hdpi or xhdpi ....so it your image is a 512px image android would down-scale it to 341px for xhdpi or 256px for an hdpi device

screens,density,smaller,android,mdpi,folder,bigger,ones,phone
owing to the fact that the screens density on the tablet is smaller android therefore uses the images in the mdpi folder for the tablet and the slightly bigger ones in the hdpi folder for the phone
