uiviewcontroller, taller, performance, ---------------------------------------------------

wish,bigger
i have a label with a single character that i wish to be bigger than the uiview that it s a subviews of

bigger
they re much bigger than the uiview of which they are subviews

smaller,webview
add smaller webview as a subviews to the uiview

smaller,selectionview,change
you could put a smaller uiview as subviews of your selectionview and change tha background color of that view

smaller,frame,parental,view
i want to add a uiview of smaller frame as subviews to parental view but i am not getting the needed

new,view,bigger
when using embed in - uiview the new view will be a bit bigger than the subviews

class,hierarchy,performance,static,larger,screen
i have a uiview class hierarchy that has self.layer.shouldrasterize turned on in order to improve scrolling performance all of them have static subviews that are larger than the screen of the device

scrollcontainer,view
i have 2 more uiview as subviews in scrollcontainer view

smaller,larger
because the uiview is smaller it is going to crop out the larger subviews

new,4px,larger,object,view
do i just create a new uiview that is 4px larger than the selected object and and make the selected view a subviews of it

smaller,main,uiviewcontroller
i have a smaller uiview as a subviews to the main uiview on my uiviewcontroller

taller,screen,scroll,view
the uiview is taller than the screen so in ib i pulled it out of the scroll view so i could see it all but i never moved it back to being a subviews of the scroll view

apple, content, uicollectionview, ---------------------------------------------------

apple,doc,uicollectionview,difficult
for my circular viewgroup i just want to put each basic view uibutton uiimageview ... around center of my circular viewgroup i read the apple doc about uiview and uicollectionview and both can contains zero or more subviews and i don t know what i should use uiview seems less difficult than uicollectionview but uicollectionview seems more appropriate for what i want to do maybe i am wrong but how implement customcollectionlayout and how set this layout in customuicollectionview because i planed to add in future custom drawing and animation

content,view,difficult,layer
of course uiscrollview can have more than one content view just as any uiview can have more than one subviews and this case it will be more difficult to render its layer

others---------------------------------------------------

issue,method,part,fine,sublayers,layers,higher,hierarchy,testviewcopy,top
i have an issue i m creating a uiview that is returned from a method and that part is fine but what i ve noticed is that when i add sublayers to one of the subviews those layers overlap subviews that are higher up in the hierarchy textview and imageview the sublayers added to testviewcopy are appearing over top of these subviews and they aren t supposed to

earlier,uiscrollview,area,keyboard,blue,smaller,button,text
though earlier uiview and uiscrollview have the same area after keyboard shown the blue uiview becomes smaller but its subviews button text fields is outside its area

auto-layout,view,better,opinion
i m sure you could do something with auto-layout but when you have a view that has subviews that need to be positioned within it subclassing uiview is a better way to go in my opinion

issue,alpha,sides,outline,uiimageview,colour
the issue is that once the alpha of the uiview is less than 1.0 i can see all the subviews sides and the one that gets me the most is the outline of an uiimageview can be seen that would otherwise not as it is the same colour as the uiview

easy,cleaner,drawing,efficient
if you take a look at the associated guides you ll see core animation and layers does require hit testing though that s relatively easy but it s far cleaner than the uiview doing all the drawing and more efficient than many subviews

scrollview,height
your scrollview height is less than the uiview which is the subviews in your case of scrollview and for scrolling it fully you will have to set your scrollview contentsize height more than the height of the view you are scrolling in it please give a check on this point

contentsize,scrollview.your,size,uiscrollview,line
change the contentsize of your scrollview.your uiview size and uiscrollview size is same if the uiscrollview contentsize is more than its subviews size then scroll will happen change the line overviewscroll setcontentsize cgsizemake screenframe.size.width screenframe.size.height-25

version,faster,controls,seconds
the subviews version is definitely faster since having the controls loose on the uiview took more like 2 seconds to update

interface,response,memory,expensive,underlying,gpu,afterwards
you are seeing a noticeable jump in interface response because subviews do in fact consume quite a bit of memory uiview are very expensive compared to their underlying calayers and as such calling -removesubview not only unloads stress from the gpu but also frees up more memory as the subviews is usually released afterwards
