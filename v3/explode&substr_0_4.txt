string,characters,efficient,array_pop
explode separates the string by characters there should be only one anyways so maybe a substr would be slightly more efficient and array_pop removes and returns the last one which should be everything after the and be the domain of the email

faster,limit,fast,solution,user
although this is much faster than explode without the limit it is not as fast as the substr solution suggested by the user set sail media

strrpos,faster
just wanted to add that using strrpos + substr is slightly faster than explode + end

better,str_replace,solutions
which should at least perform better than explode str_replace and substr solutions
