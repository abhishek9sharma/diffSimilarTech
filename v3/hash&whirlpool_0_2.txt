best,expensive,function,slower,fifth,number,operations,opposite
at best it is a computationally expensive hash function like whirlpool that for example is five times slower than md5 and thus allows only a fifth of the number of hash operations in opposite to md5

longer,secure,sha512
if you want longer hash lets call more secure you should use something like sha512 whirlpool etc
