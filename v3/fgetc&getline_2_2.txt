iostreams,faster,release,mode
the fact that using getline with iostreams is faster than fgetc at least in release mode runs counter to the reasoning that copying all that data must be slower than not copying it so i m not sure what all optimization is able to avoid and i didn t really look to find any explanation but it d be interesting to understand what s being optimized away

debug,mode,version,slower,âµs
i confirmed that in debug mode the getline version is slower about 130 âµs vs 60 âµs for the fgetc version
