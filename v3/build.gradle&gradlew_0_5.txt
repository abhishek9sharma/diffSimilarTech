double
i double checked the build.gradle s and synced the gradlew files once more

conditional,dependency,settings,particular,version,process,definition,better
question is there a way to define conditional dependency in the build.gradle or another settings file so that a particular gradlew version is used for the build process that is ensured to be in compliance with the available java version either 1.6 or 1.8 either by manual definition or better by letting gradlew decide which version of itself to use

higher,priority,value,androidmanifest.xml,application
although build.gradle has a higher priority so the value in androidmanifest.xml will be ignored by gradlew while building your application

better,ivy,dependency,management
i naively assumed that gradlew is better than ivy then when i created my build.gradle the dependency management is even greater mess than of ivy s for the first look

use,string,line,readable
i use gradlew and want to create a string in my build.gradle which goes over more than one line to make it more readable
