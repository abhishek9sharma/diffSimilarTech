easier,example,files
dotnetzip is much easier to use than sharpziplib example of zipping all files in folder

extraction,smaller,kb,permissive
i used it because it is small 6 kb compiled with just the extraction making it far smaller than dotnetzip which is more than 150 kb and is more permissive than sharpziplib

native,support,opinion,flexible
dotnetzip offers native support and has a quite friendly api and is my opinion more flexible than sharpziplib

blow,simple,nice,wrong,nicer,api
gave up and switched to sharpziplib as it doesn t blow up on simple extract but sure would be nice to know what was wrong with dotnetzip it has a nicer api
