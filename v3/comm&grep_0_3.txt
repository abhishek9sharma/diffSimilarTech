set,lines
i find grep to be more admin-friendly than comm so if you just want the set of matching lines useful for comparing csvs for instance simply use

diff,require,process,substitution,magnitude,faster,-f,infinite
if this is an issue you could try sd stream diff which doesn t require sorting like comm does nor process substitution like the above examples is orders or magnitude faster than grep -f and supports infinite streams

faster,input
i rather prefer grep since it s much faster than comm and also does not require the input to be sorted
