multiple, example, little, ---------------------------------------------------

stick,example,better
they have their differences better stick to one i prefer for this example to use keydown just plays better with me you can use keyup

better,methodology,multiple
also note that keydown is better for this methodology as keyup will fire multiple times though i guess this will too.

little,better,element,silently-ish
edit keydown is a little better than keyup for the element bind now enter key fails silently-ish

preferable,multiple,user
keyup is more preferable than keydown because keydown may occur multiple times if user keeps it pressed

event,better,opinion,finger,button
also if you notice i ve changed the keyup event to keydown which is better in my opinion cause when the user holds their finger down on a button the code wouldn t be fired if it is on the keyup event

field, keyup, sense, ---------------------------------------------------

input,sense,previous,value
also note that using keyup or input makes far more sense than keydown otherwise the previous value will only be evaluated on the next event occurrence

right,events,value,field
then the right events to do it is keyup more than keydown since the value isn t yet in the field at this moment or on change

events,numpad5,numpad6,earlier,event
as you can see the keyup events of numpad5 and numpad6 occured earlier than their keydown event

.val,.keyup,newest,value,better
use .val and .keyup using keydown doesn t register the newest value it registers the value before so keyup is better to use for this

others---------------------------------------------------

better,use,event,name,example,last,symbol
better use keyup event name as in my example because keydown requires one more click for the last symbol to be updated

event,listbox,longer,dialogbox,listview
i changed to use the keydown event on the listbox insted of keyup and do no longer have the problem as keydown is in dialogbox and not on listview but keyup occurs on listview

next,letter,event,row,corresponding,events,noticeable
also even without using the shift key when typing quickly i often find i haven t quite released a key before typing the next letter so i get more than one keydown event in a row before the corresponding keyup events - this has no noticeable bad effect in normal circumstances but is noticeable when there s code responding to both the down and up events

test,smoother,transition
in my test keyup gives a smoother transition as compared to keydown

good,time,effect,document,better,game
keyup is usually a good time to respond to any action that is going to have an effect on a document but keydown would be better if it s a game where the user wants immediate effect

rules,second,earlier,first,timer,multiple
the events seem to not follow strict sequential rules second keydown comes earlier than first keyup so the timer gets initialized multiple times

logic,mouse,mousedown,mouseup,sense
logic to handle enter + mouse click is placed on keydown and mousedown it could be moved to keyup and mouseup if makes more sense
