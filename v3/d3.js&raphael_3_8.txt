brother, fallback, place, ---------------------------------------------------

older,browsers,brother
this should be possible maybe be aware snap.svg isn t so compatible with older browsers in which case you could look at raphael which is snaps older brother d3.js is very well established as well

older,versions,current,web
raphael supports older versions of ie whereas d3.js is based on current web standards

place,fallback,older,versions,current,web
the only place where raphael defeats d3.js is fallback raphael supports older versions of ie where as d3.js is based on current web standards ie 9

others---------------------------------------------------

harder,svg,able
d3.js is much harder to learn than raphael but in both cases you will also have to learn svg to be able to create better animations

similar,thd,lines
raphael is very much similar to d3.js but is more on thd lines of a graphics library and the added advantage of compatibility with internet explorer 6 through 8 using vml instead of svg.

better,processing,viable
as it stands d3.js is not just better than raphael and processing in many cases but is also a viable replacement for jquery underscore.js and other frameworks

lower,versions
i am using d3.js with raphael to support the lower versions of internet explorer

hand,visualizations,mathematics,similar,processing,examples,prepackaged
on the other hand normally d3.js visualizations need less mathematics than the similar processing or raphael examples because there are many prepackaged layouts already
