memory,footprint,leaks,complications
using cron should have less of a memory footprint than a php script - and you don t need to worry about memory leaks and the complications o running the php as a daemon

thought,script,scalable,best,server-side,better
my first thought was to have a php script called by cron which could work but i m not sure if that s really scalable the best way to go about this would making a server-side daemon be better

lightweight,real-time,work
but honestly cron is fairly lightweight and unless it needs to be real-time or whatever that means to you writing php into a daemon is more work than it s work
