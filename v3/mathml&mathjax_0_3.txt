note,input,form,asciimath
note that you can configure mathjax to allow for more than one input form so could use asciimath for everything else and mathml for this

need,polyfills,matters,interaction,button,load
in addition the need for polyfills for mathml complicates matters further as they may handle the interaction differently as can be seen in the sample below when using the button to load mathjax
