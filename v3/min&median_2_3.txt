components, first, k, ---------------------------------------------------

max,components,array,left,right,selection,phase,greater
to find the median and left right you probably want to call it to find the median and then just do the max of the components of the array to the left and the min of the components to the right because you know once the median selection phase is done that all elements to the left of the median will be less than it and to the right will be greater or equal

first,k,element,heap,max,greater,pointers,heapify
so after calculating median of first k elements delete the first element directly from heap min or max according to whether it is greater or less than median using pointers and then use heapify at that position

others---------------------------------------------------

equal,greater
from min to the median is less equal or greater than the one from
