alternative, use, idea, ---------------------------------------------------

mouseleave,reliable,mouseover
imho mouseenter and mouseleave are much more reliable than mouseover and mouseout which tend to flicker

mouseleave,work,better,mouseover
it should also be noted that mouseenter and mouseleave work somewhat differently and usually much better than mouseover and mouseout

mouseleave,better,behaviour,mouseover
in this case mouseenter mouseleave has better behaviour and prevents bubbling compared to mouseover mouseout

idea,mouseleave,better,alternative,mouseover
i have no idea about the classes but i think mouseenter and mouseleave are better alternative for mouseout and mouseover

use,mouseover,mouseleave
because jquery doesn t use mouseover and mouseout it uses mouseenter and mouseleave which are more suited to this scenario

mouseleave,reliable,mouseover
also you might want to use mouseenter and mouseleave which are sanitized by jquery and are a little more reliable than mouseover and mouseout

mouseup,mousedown,mouseleave,mouseover
this may make for various race conditions and may necessitate using events which give you earlier notification than mouseup mousedown mouseenter mouseleave mouseover mouseout

browsers,mouseleave,events,accurate
some browsers implement the mouseenter mouseleave events that i ve noticed are more accurate than mouseout

others---------------------------------------------------

mouseover,better,ones,.hover,method
also instead of mouseover and mouseout use the better ones mouseenter and mouseleave or simply the .hover method
