python3,higher
in python3 range can go much higher though not to infinity

value,exponent,wider,floating-point,result
in the default to-nearest rounding mode the mathematical result of the addition would have to be above the middle point between double.maxvalue and the next floating-point value that could be represented if the exponent range was wider for the floating-point result to round up to infinity

interpolation,polynomial,data
splines interpolation is probably more useful for you than polynomial interpolation if you fit a polynomial it must inevitably head off to + - infinity outside your data range
