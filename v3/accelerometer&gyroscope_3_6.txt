function, magnetometer, sensors, ---------------------------------------------------

sensor,sensors,magnetometer
some of people says that i have to use not just accelerometer sensor use more sensors such as gyroscope or magnetometer

sensor,accurate,function
also i have tried the accelerometer sensor and it worked but i m asking to check whether the gyroscope is more accurate to this function or the accelerometer

sensor,accurate
so after googling this i found that using gyroscope sensor is more accurate than the accelerometer

others---------------------------------------------------

beter,indication,movement
the gyroscope will give a beter indication on movement then the accelerometer

power,analysis,higher
gyroscope consumes more power than accelerometer based on my analysis its 4-6 times higher

better
i want to use accelerometer but i learnt that gyroscope is better option to calculate the accelerometer
