opengl, menus, posters, ---------------------------------------------------

opengl,better,menus
or if you re really focused on only doing opengl i may suggest using glfw which is the better glut but you ll have to draw the menus yourself using opengl

posters,better
edit explained as i m guessing you are somehow forced to use glut but i agree with other posters glfw is a better option if you can choose

others---------------------------------------------------

closer,character,small
between these glfw is much closer to glut in character -- a small toolkit for abstracting away most of the os-dependent parts so you can produce opengl programs with relatively little hassle
