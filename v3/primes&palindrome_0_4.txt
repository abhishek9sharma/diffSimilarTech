iteration
calculating primes takes more iteration than checking for a palindrome

program,highest
i m trying to create a program that outputs the highest primes than is a palindrome and is less than 1000

sparser,set,numbers
palindrome are a sparser set of numbers than primes and you can generate palindrome directly

algorithm,slower,testing
any algorithm that is based on generating primes then testing for a palindrome will be much slower that generating palindrome and then testing for primes
