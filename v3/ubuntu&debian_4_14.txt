better, stable, team, ---------------------------------------------------

stable,server,rare
as for debian being more stable than ubuntu for using as server it can be true in very rare occasions where the package is very obscure

team,experience,better,server
but if your team has ubuntu experience maybe debian would be better choice for server infrastructure if you do not need the bleeding edge set of applications

others---------------------------------------------------

packages,user,friendly
both use debian packages and ubuntu is based on debian but is more user friendly

kernels,harder,tools
recompiling ubuntu kernels is harder -- it will require working with debian build tools

official,package
i have installed these two tools with the official package of ubuntu and also with the package of debian that seems more updated

newer,squeeze
since ubuntu 10.10 is newer than debian squeeze if you can do it on squeeze you can certainly do it on ubuntu

conservative,closer,bleeding
ubuntu is far less conservative than debian so you will get closer to the bleeding edge

smaller,wheezy
i believe ubuntu is smaller debian wheezy smaller still or even alpine for tiny start point

main,advantage,image,smaller,mb
the main advantage of the debian image is the smaller size Ã¢ it clocks in at around 85.1 mb compared to around 200 mb for ubuntu

newer,version,libstdc++,available
this is because ubuntu 15.10 uses a newer version of libc and libstdc++ which is not available on debian 8

wheezy,recent
i m in debian wheezy which is much more recent than ubuntu 10.04

distro
on my debian should be more or less the same on any debian based distro like ubuntu

nicer,frontend,windows,emigrants,backend,guys
ubuntu has nicer frontend and could be more suitable for windows emigrants while debian is more for backend guys

scripting,resources
ubuntu heavily relies on python scripting and generally consumes more resources than debian
