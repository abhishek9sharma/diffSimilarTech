programmer, convenient, strlen, ---------------------------------------------------

memory,pointer,malloc,impossible,longer
you should know that strdup allocates more memory and returns its pointer which you then overwrite the original pointer returned by malloc so it will be impossible to free that memory since you no longer have the pointers

things,programmer,worse,malloc,memory
in c memory most other things are managed by the programmer so strdup is no worse than forgetting to free malloc ed memory failing to null terminate a string using incorrect format string in scanf and invoking undefined behaviour accessing dangling pointer etc

convenient,strlen,result,obligation,storage,longer
additionally if you have strdup then it is much more convenient than strlen + malloc + strcpy with identical result including the same obligation to free the allocated storage when you no longer need it
