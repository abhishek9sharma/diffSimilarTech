memset, faster, memory, ---------------------------------------------------

conceivable,address,memory,zeros,faster,memset,combo
it s conceivable that calloc could return address of memory location that is already pre-initialized with zeros thus it may be faster than malloc + memset combo

end,memory,faster,memset,difference
if end up using the memory anyway calloc is still faster than malloc and memset but the difference is not quite so ridiculous

slower,initialization,memory
i remember somewhere i have read that calloc is slower than malloc because calloc performs initialization to zero after performing memory allocation

extra,work,faster,memset
this is an enormous amount of extra work and explains why calloc is faster than malloc and memset

examples,memory,faster,separate,step,loop
assuming the total amount of memory being initialized in your two examples is the same allocating the memory with calloc might be faster than allocating the memory with malloc and then zeroing them out in a separate step especially if in the malloc case you zero the elements individually by iterating over them in a loop

slower,time,contents
calloc itself is slower than malloc because you have to spend some time to clear the contents of allocated memory

faster,implementations
malloc might be faster than calloc on some implementations

faster,memory,zeros
malloc is faster since calloc initializes the allocated memory to contain all zeros

better,zero-initialization,faster
it would be better to use malloc over calloc unless we want the zero-initialization because malloc is faster than calloc

faster,memset
this means calloc can potentially be faster than calling malloc followed by memset since it can skip the memset if it knows it will already by zeroed

thing,bytes,useful,memory,slower
calloc does the same thing as malloc but initializes all bytes to zero -- useful when you want to insure all memory is initialized and only slightly slower than malloc

faster,combination,memset,hand
and is as far as i know faster than the combination of malloc and memset on the other hand malloc alone is faster than calloc

page.,post,better,+,memset
it takes a page off of the free_page_list updates mem_map zeroes the page and returns the physical address of the page. here s another post that explains it well and also explains why using calloc is better than malloc + memset

faster,memset,mmap,pages
calloc is faster than malloc + memset because calloc knows that the mmap d pages are pre-zeroed and memset forces the allocation of physical ram

longer,memory
calloc does take longer than malloc because it has to zero out all the memory you asked for before giving it to you

slower,system,memory
also calloc is slower than malloc from operating system memory allocation perspective

memset,slower
my question is why is malloc + memset so much slower than calloc

memset,slower,certain,conditions
malloc + memset is slower than calloc under certain conditions

memset,efficient
one reason to use calloc over malloc plus memset is that calloc may be more efficient

memset,closer
actually calling memset after malloc is closer to calling calloc than the option you suggest

speed,likely,faster,memset,memory
in terms of speed calloc is likely to be faster than malloc + memset if memory needs to be zeroed out

memset,slower
see also why malloc + memset is slower than calloc

free, realloc, thereâ, ---------------------------------------------------

free,harder,thereâ,realloc
malloc free is harder because thereâ s also calloc and realloc

simpler,quicker,free,realloc,heap,huge
in this context free store is different and incompatible with heap because the new delete free store library is simpler and quicker than the malloc free realloc calloc heap library and thus provides huge memory usage gains to the c++ embedded programmer in a context where you have only 512 bytes of ram

hard, sensible, better, ---------------------------------------------------

better,hard,sensible
as written malloc would be better than calloc but the question used calloc and it would not be hard to make it sensible for use with this code too for example a conditional assignment in set_matrix such as

better
in fact using calloc instead of malloc would be even better

others---------------------------------------------------

better,default,values,space,garbage
calloc would be a better choice here as it is going to assign default 0 values whereas malloc will just allocate space having garbage values

common
malloc is far more common in c code than calloc

array,null,correct
edit i m not a java expert but i think that in java members of new array are initialized to 0 or null so calloc is more correct than malloc in my code

answers,larger,blocks
those answers was that calloc can allocate larger blocks than malloc can and etc

faster,single,dimensional,pointer,format,double
malloc is faster than calloc reason is that malloc processed single dimensional array to pointer format whereas calloc takes double dimensional array and before processed it converts to single dimensional array then to pointer format

first,longer,execution
the first calloc subsequently malloc has a longer execution time then

real,point,normal
there s also no real point using calloc here - malloc would be more normal

g_new0,arguments
g_new and g_new0 both take the same arguments unlike malloc that takes less arguments than calloc

arguments,type,bigger,blocks,able,argument
for this reason since calloc uses two arguments of type size_t it can allocate bigger blocks than malloc will ever be able to since malloc takes only one argument of type size_t
