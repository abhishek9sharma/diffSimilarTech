murmurhash has 64 and 128-bit versions so you can experiment between the two and it s faster than md5 largely owing to md5 being a cryptographic hash function whereas murmur doesn t have the added expense complexity of being cryptographically secure i m assuming that you re not concerned about anybody attempting to intentionally generate hash collisions or anything like that

reference,faster,functions,direct
but as that reference points out murmurhash is way faster than md5 and sha functions although it doesn t do a direct comparison to the object.gethashcode method i mentioned above
