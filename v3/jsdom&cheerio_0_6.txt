offer,complete,set,tools,faster
jsdom jquery offer complete set of tools but cheerio is much faster

options,module,faster,heavy,weight
if it is unavoidable node.js has good options - try to use the module cheerio which is faster than heavy weight jsdom

simpler,jquery-like
there s also jsdom but cheerio is simpler and comes with jquery-like goodness

switcht,faster,scanning,hundreds
i had the same problem with jsdom and switcht to cheerio which is much faster than jsdom and works even after scanning hundreds of sites

available,html,lightweight,jquery-like,api
if you don t need a full dom available and just want to parse and scrape manipulate html elements there is cheerio which is more lightweight than jsdom and still gives you a jquery-like api

request,easier,tasks
i find request + cheerio to be easier than jsdom for tasks like this
