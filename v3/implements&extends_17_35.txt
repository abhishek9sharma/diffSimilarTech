better, mealhistoryactivity, sense, ---------------------------------------------------

interface,better,system,superclass
i have not found a lot of times when implements an interface would be a better system than extends a superclass

sense,class,higher,priority,interface
which i think makes sense because extends from a class should take higher priority than implements from an interface

runnable,better,thread,idea
i have read that implements runnable is better than extends thread but i have no idea of how

class,mealhistoryactivity,activity,onconnectionfailedlistener,locationlistener
public class mealhistoryactivity extends activity implements connectioncallbacks onconnectionfailedlistener locationlistener ..

thread,runnable,class,better
we can either extends thread which will implicitly implements runnable but then we can t extends any other class so implements runnable is better approch

thread,runnable,better
i switched a thread from extends thread to implements runnable implements runnable is better practice right

superclass,better
when you extends you incorporate the code of the superclass into yours sometimes there is no code to incorporate so implements is better suited

runnable,better
implements runnable is better because you can extends other classes

runable,better,thread
i also know implements runable is better than extends thread

actionlistener,second,inner,class,better
however rather than extends actionlistener as in your second example you ll probably find that putting the listener implementation into a different class even an inner class which implements actionlistener provides better logical logical separation of your code

runnable,better,thread,class
why is implements runnable a better option than extends from thread class

class,orthogonal,runnable,thread,better
but whether or not your use an anonymous class is orthogonal to the question of whether implements runnable or extends thread is the better mechanism to define your thread task

runnable,preferrable,thread
they say that implements runnable is more preferrable than extends thread

implementation,better,uicomponent,class,reference,interfaces
if your goal is education and not ease of implementation you would probably be better served by extends the uicomponent class and using the treeitemrenderer code as a reference to create a class that implements the same interfaces

note, methods, baseadapter, ---------------------------------------------------

note,mouseadapter,easier,methods
note extends mouseadapter is easier since you only need to implements the methods you want to handle

value,listview,arrayadapter,easier,baseadapter
second in order to add or update the value of listview in general extends arrayadapter is much easier than implements baseadapter because of arrayadapter support add remove insert method by itself

others---------------------------------------------------

rawcomparator,faster,writablecomparator
is implements the rawcomparator that much faster than extends writablecomparator

instance,pdostatement,c-level
this is kind-of the functionality you for instance see but you instantly already see that there it s called at an instance and the fact it requires to extends rather then implements pdostatement has more to do with the c-level implementation functionality of that class

life,easier,components,custom,component,event
you can make your life easier by extends each of the components you use to a custom component that either implements its own event but then always the same event like contentchanged or takes a java 8 consumer function that is called whenever the content changes

architecture,architectures,one-byte,value,plain,chars
plain chars having unspecified signed-ness allows compilers to select whichever representation is more efficient for the target architecture on some architectures zero extends a one-byte value to the size of int requires less operations thus making plain chars unsigned while on others the instruction set makes sign-extending more natural and plain chars gets implements as signed

midlet,listener,work
and i write extends midlet implements command listener amm it doesn t work am dont get any bug and if i copy all my code and i paste it in a new project midlet and i delete all it has and i paste my code it does work mmm always and when the name was for default hellomidlet i just watch two things.

authenticationservice,nothing,zend,authentication,service,identityproviderinterface
where application authentication authenticationservice is nothing more than an extends of the zend authentication service and implements the identityproviderinterface

choppy,okay,obscene,number,queries,easier
the current example is a bit choppy in rendering which may be okay for you but if not you will need to extends the already obscene number of media queries that are driving it it would likely be much easier to implements using less or sass

api,external,better,position,oauth,doorkeeper
but if you d like to extends this api to be used by the external services then you ll be in a much better position with implements oauth 2.0 using doorkeeper because you can easily configure for example a authorization code grant for them

uglier,facade,pattern,map,intermediate
but that seems a lot uglier than implements a facade pattern and just extends the map code but that is a lot of intermediate code to create a facade for

keyword,general,generic,type,class,interface
the extends keyword is more general in this sense since it s used to mean that the generic type could either extends another class or implements an interface

life,easier,implementation,interface,clientdetails,org.springframework.security.oauth2.provider.client.baseclientdetails,leverage,baseclientdetails
before we move on i just wanted to mention that spring oauth2 already provides an implementation for the above interface meaning that we could make our life a lot easier by actually extends the only implementation of the above interface clientdetails which is org.springframework.security.oauth2.provider.client.baseclientdetails rather than implements it from the beginning leverage all that can be done from baseclientdetails and add our own custom fields hence the myclientdetails looks as follow then

nothing,valid,typescript,appropriate
although extends by nothing is valid typescript it would seem to me that in this case implements would be more appropriate

thing,answer,gridviewpager
more or less the same thing as the accepted answer can be implements more succinctly by extends the gridviewpager like this

sense,typo,book
extends makes more sense to me here than implements maybe it s a typo in the book

possible,stronger,relationship,type,relationships
a possible reason is that extends represents a a stronger relationship than implements although both represent is a or is a type of relationships

solutions,available,asp.net,identity,better,custom,solution
are there some solutions available to extends asp.net identity better than implements a custom solution as suggested in the links

covers,better,hard,ms,thing
mvc is the most extensible and if you are familiar with how things work under the covers you ll probably be better off than implements a hard to extends ms thing like odata and wcf

gcc,integer,type,unsigned
here is how gcc does it it sign extends if the integer type is larger than the pointer type this ll happen regardless of the integer being signed or unsigned just because that s how gcc decided to implements it

larger,errors
implements gives larger errors because i tried with extends
