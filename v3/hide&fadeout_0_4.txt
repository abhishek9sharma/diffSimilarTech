show,effect,softer,fadein,declarations,console
note the show hide effect is much softer because of the commented fadein fadeout declarations that were triggering console errors probably because jsfiddle uses jquery slim now

simpler,animation,element
fadeout is simpler because it will hide it for you automatically when it is done so you can save that code and it automatically waits for the animation to be done before hiding the element something your current code was not doing

test,faster,use,animations
according to this test - hide is slightly faster then fadeout since it doesn t use animations

show,fadein,appropriate,top
or more ideally you might want to change show hide to jquery fadein fadeout which is more appropriate for back to top indicators
