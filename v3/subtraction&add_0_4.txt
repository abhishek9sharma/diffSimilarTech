addition,worse,sequence,first,compiler,operations,independent
addition and subtraction is worse as these have to be done in sequence of two operations and the second operation requires the first to have completed - this is not the case if the compiler is just producing two add operations on independent data

addition,faster
since addition can be faster then subtraction we add the offset instead of subtract it from 31

book,addition,lower,priority,operators,value,typical
and my question is this if the book says that the addition and subtraction have lower priority compared to other operators what if i add the value of a typical expression multiplied

addition,assignment,lower,procedure,operation
addition subtraction assignment has lower procedure than simply add operation
