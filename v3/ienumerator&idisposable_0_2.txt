likely,implements,not--the,earlier
most likely for the same reason that implements idisposable but ienumerator does not--the earlier version was written before the authors thought of circumstances where one an a implementation might need cleanup but a factory returning such an implementation might not know about such need

manual,ways
due to ienumerator not implementing idisposable more manual ways of doing it end up being a bit fiddly.
