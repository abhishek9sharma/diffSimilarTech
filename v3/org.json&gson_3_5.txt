slower, better, jackson, ---------------------------------------------------

jackson,slower
org.json jackson and gson with gson being 10x slower

jackson,better
quick takeaway of the benchmark jackson performs 5 to 6 times better than org.json and more than twice better than gson

better,jackson
or switch from org.json to something that performs better such as gson or jackson

others---------------------------------------------------

usability,odds,easier,alternatives,jackson
well sometimes performance and usability can be at odds but i ve found gson to be easier to use than alternatives like jackson org.json and others

data,json,good,approach,easy
for encoding data in json yes gson is a good approach but i think that org.json would be more easy to use
