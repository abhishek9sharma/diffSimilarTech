slower, performance, usage, ---------------------------------------------------

disk,usage,compression,faster,myisam
from my personal use i experienced about 5 - 10 times less disk usage due to tokudb s compression and it s much much faster than myisam or innodb

insert,performance,slower,myisam
at the beginning the insert performance of innodb is almost 50 times slower than myisam and tokudb is 40 times slower than myisam

others---------------------------------------------------

use,tables,rows,nothing,faster,random,inserts
i use tokudb on tables of up to 18 billion rows and nothing else comes close it s at least 100 times faster than innodb for random inserts on big tables
