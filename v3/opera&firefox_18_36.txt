slower, better, worse, ---------------------------------------------------

worse
the problem with this code is that it doesn t quite work on firefox and works even worse on opera

slower,faster
it seems to be slower in google-chrome and firefox but is significantly faster in opera

better
apparently opera ie and firefox works better with

better
firefox google-chrome opera and safari all handle it better

framerates,slower
for example i ve read that opera and ie will fix framerates slower than firefox

div, smaller, etc, ---------------------------------------------------

user,space,etc..,smaller
i d support both ie still has a big chunk of the user space with firefox and others opera safari etc.. occupying a smaller percentage of the browser market

css,settings,ribbon,div
now this works fine in google-chrome and safari and i have had to use assitional css settings for firefox but ie and opera both display my ribbon div about 25px higher than in google-chrome or safari

text,smaller,right
why in firefox text smaller left than in google-chrome and opera right

div,width,bigger
on your screenshot div width in opera is bigger than in firefox and google-chrome

browsers, size, mobile, ---------------------------------------------------

webkit-based,browsers,closer
all the webkit-based browsers safari google-chrome and opera should be closer in their rendering to each other than firefox or ie 9 separately

mobile,browsers,smaller,size
but on all of the mobile browsers i ve tried firefox google-chrome opera it s much smaller around 25 of the size specified

major,browsers,better,container
it s way faster on ie but other major browsers firefox google-chrome safari and opera perform better when using a container and then appending it fragment or div

browser, webkit, results, ---------------------------------------------------

specific,browser,webkit,devs,knowledgeable
usually you want to avoid solutions from browser-vendor as they ll cater toward that specific browser but opera webkit google-chrome safari firefox devs are usually more knowledgeable in terms of cross-browser solutions and compliance with the standards than m ones

answers,browser,support,internet,explorer
answers in opera was checking browser support for my page and wanted to search some stuff up. i don t get this message in my default browser google-chrome nor in internet explorer or firefox

results,browser,faster,webkit
the results varied from a browser to another firefox 4.0b12 is faster using but google-chrome webkit and opera is faster when using

browser,mozilla,thier,design
look every browser like mozilla firefox google-chrome opera have thier own design for modal window

lower, bit, pixels, ---------------------------------------------------

little,bit,lower
in opera it goes little bit lower than in firefox

pixels,higher,lower
in safari it is several pixels higher up than in firefox and google-chrome and significantly lower in opera

others---------------------------------------------------

work,setting,iframed,page
safari and opera work with the google-chrome setting but firefox and ie display the iframed page larger than google-chrome causing part of the text to be cut off

recent,builds,strict,regard,bigger,viewport,presto,table
google-chrome recent builds only and firefox are behaving very strict in this regard no matter how much content you have it will be no bigger than your viewport while opera presto behaves more like a table 100 is treated as a minimum not a maximum

line,div,better,last,disaster,inconsistency,br,behavior
the second happened when you remove everything and starting type and hit enter different browsers behavior very differently google-chrome insert very first line as a just text node of contenteditable container and than put every new line into div opera 12.12 handle it better and it never allows remove last div node ie9-10 starting jump around and after you started again uses p tags instead of div that s not even such a disaster just inconsistency but yet the firefox is not yet even trying to change it s br behavior

works,weirdish,blur,effect,hover,smaller,ends
works in google-chrome firefox a bit weirdish blur effect on hover opera ends look smaller safari ends look smaller

older,safe,insertadjacenthtml
well unless you re targeting older than google-chrome 1.0 firefox 8.0 ie 4.0 opera 7.0 or safari 4.0 it s safe to use insertadjacenthtml

idea,frame,browser,correct
the idea is that if they are using ie then they must install google-chrome frame and if they are using less than firefox 4 or opera 11.5 then they must upgrade their browser not not sure if the way i am doing that is correct

declaration,arial,show,huge,variations,smaller,variations.
when using a font declaration of arial firefox and ie11 show relatively huge variations while google-chrome and opera show smaller variations.

linux,gentoo,reneders,larger,fonts,nothing,odd
update under linux gentoo amd64 it s the same - opera reneders slightly larger fonts than firefox but nothing that looks odd

donâ,launch,time,equal,2ms,faster,difference,empty
but if firebug donâ t enabled after launch firefox â time equal 2ms that faster than opera and google-chrome and difference between empty filled array disappears

market,html5
firefox safari google-chrome and opera make up more than 30 of the market and they support many html5 standards

share,example,pie,distance,slice,connector
for example in the classic browser share example if the firefox is at 45 i want to be rendered inside the pie distance -40 may be and where the slice is less such as opera at 6 - i want it to be shown outside with a connector

site,need,css,font,sizes,smaller,default,minimum-font-size
my site displays just like in need in ie and opera but in firefox i can t get via css to have font sizes smaller than firefox default minimum-font-size

fewer,none
firefox has even fewer as far as i know and opera has none

access,internals,extensions,possible,widgets
firefox just provides far more access to its own internals and system to the extensions so its technically possible to do more with them than with opera widgets or google-chrome extensions

font-weight,lighter,older,h1,tags,bolder,sorry
you can use font-weight 100 or lighter this is working with opera 16 and older but i do not know why the h1 tags in firefox are bolder sorry

older,ie11,esr,ios,konqueror,versions
the downside is that you cannot use it for browsers older than ie11 firefox 31 esr safari 7.1 ios 7 konqueror all versions and opera all versions

element,webkit,things,center,standards,compliant
the center align property must be cascading from some other element because it s not only safari google-chrome which also uses webkit but also opera that shows the things center aligned and both safari google-chrome and opera are more standards compliant than ie and even firefox

coverage,market,half,huge,strong
in any case vorbis clearly has the most coverage google-chrome has more of the market than safari now opera is about half of safari and obviously firefox is huge and it doesn t really have the strong opposition that theora has
