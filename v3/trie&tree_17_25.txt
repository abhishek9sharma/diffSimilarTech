wiki, dummy, dictionary, ---------------------------------------------------

radix,better,memory,strings,regular,common
a radix tree will provide a better memory usage for strings than a regular trie if you have a lot of strings with common roots prefixes which is probably the case for a dictionary words with many forms - although that would probably depend on the language

efficient,sort,dictionary,binary,ternary
most likely a trie is more efficient and you didn t sort your dictionary and it doesn t use a binary tree or ternary tree

binary,search,similar,character,alphabet
recursive is usually used for traversal and binary search tree but this tree is more similar to trie of only 2 character in alphabet

suffix,dummy,nodes
a suffix tree has less dummy nodes than the suffix trie

article,better,binary,string,length,time
the article says that a trie is better than binary tree as for a string of length m for trie it takes o m time and for binary tree it takes o m logn time

suffix,advanced,substrings
a suffix tree is more or less an advanced trie here you can also search for any substrings in o c as for the trie

note,specific,keys,binary,search,general
note that while a trie works for the specific case of keys which are strings a binary search tree is much more general and only requires that the keys can be ordered

efficient,binary,hashmap,word
as suggested a trie would be more efficient than a binary tree but you can use a hashmap and hash each word

redix,suffix,better,kind
also you can use redix trie or suffix tree these are far better suited for this kind of operations and much faster but they require a pre-processing of the data and might require more processing power

better,kind,thing,symbols,values
a trie is better suited to this kind of thing because it lets you store your symbols as a tree and quickly parse it to match values or reject them

suffix,lighter,faster,index,dna
the suffix tree is lighter and faster than the trie and is used to index dna or optimize some large web search engines

radix,wiki,performance.the,memory,efficient
use a radix tree wiki or trie wiki if you are concerned about performance.the radix tree is more memory efficient compared to a trie

better,binary,search
a trie is better than a binary search tree for searching elements

general,easier,specialized,radix,requirements,space
in this case a general trie might be easier to deal than the more specialized radix tree but the requirements in space are a bit higher

children, dawg, representation, ---------------------------------------------------

patricia,radix,space,efficient,table,strings,lookup,computational
for example the patricia trie or the radix tree that is far more space efficient than an hash table for strings but of course being a tree lookup computational complexity is o log n and building it is o n log n

space,overhead,patricia,representation,efficient,pointers,dawg
however that space overhead can be reduced by compressing the trie using the patricia tree representation using a more efficient data structure to store child pointers or building a dawg from the trie

node,children,space,efficient,ternary,search
for cases where each node in the trie has most of its children used the trie is substantially more space efficient and time efficient than th ternary search tree

others---------------------------------------------------

n-ary,specific,method,vector
i ve implemented a n-ary tree to be more specific a trie and i was wondering if there s a method to represent and traverse it as a vector

ps,faster,compact,side,effects,tables,significant
ps radix tree is usually faster and more compact then trie but suffers from the same side effects of trie comparing to hash tables though less significant of course

b+,difficult,red-black,level,complexity
finally b+ tree is admittedly more difficult to implement than a trie it s more on a red-black tree level of complexity

van,emde,boas,better,bet
a trie or perhaps a van emde boas tree might be a better bet for creating a space efficient set of integers with lookup time bring constant against the number of objects in the data structure assuming that even std bitset would be too large

project,good,avl,woud,efficient,phonebook
should i change my project to trie or is there any other good reasons where avl tree woud be more efficient than trie in case of phonebook

use,levels,depth,complex,performance
in my use case i don t anticipate the trie to grow more than 2-3 levels in depth so if your tree gets very complex you might want to analyze performance issues and see if the additional lookups will cause too much overheads

deletions,array,expensive,tha,b
another suggested reason is that deletions from a array mapped trie are more expensive tha from a b tree

point,earlier,ternary,better,options
instead there comes a point much earlier where a trie or a ternary tree become better options
