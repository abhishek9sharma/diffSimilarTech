routes,klein,microframeworks,easier,simpler
and if you need to manage lots of routes easily you can use klein or flask microframeworks or even bottle to make it easier and simpler for you a simple minimal usage example for using klein would look something like this

https,support,straight
i am using bottle but i am going to want to use https and support for https under flask seems much more straight forward

dependency,better,jinja2,werkzeug
i d totally go with flask unless one dependency bottle is better than three flask jinja2 and werkzeug

trick,preference,faster,lightweight
either will do the trick but bottle or in my preference flask will be faster as it is much more lightweight than django

faster
bottle is rather faster than flask
