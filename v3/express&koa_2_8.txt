restify, application, faster, ---------------------------------------------------

faster,framework,restify
it shows that koa is faster then other framework but as this question is about express and restify express is faster than restify

application,framework,sails
it is very common to use a web application framework like express sails hapi or koa there are many more

others---------------------------------------------------

middleware,simpler,hacky
koa middleware is much simpler and less hacky than express middleware due to the way middleware flows in a stack-like manner

tj,best,framework,simple,concept
personally i would recommand using express.js framework written by tj but i would not say it s the best one you might have heard koa framework but i think express would be more simple concept than it. like es6 generator function etc.

blog,request,better
see this blog when you have 10000 request koa performs better than express

familiar,entry,server.js
i am more familiar with express than koa but could also see it going in the entry server.js file

kind,thing,low,level
koa doesn t provide this kind of thing out of the box - it s designed to be a little more low level than express

ctx.request.get,authorization,req.header,routes
i should also say that i have the token at ctx.request.get authorization koa based i think it s something like req.header authorization with express in all routes
