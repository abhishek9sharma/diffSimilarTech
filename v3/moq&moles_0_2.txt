better,unmockable,combination,interfaces,framework,externalities
personally i think moles is much better suited for mocking the unmockable and i prefer a combination of moq for my own interfaces and classes and moq for framework and externalities like file i o gui db connections etc

typemock,set,facilities,rhinomocks,sweet
moles is more often compared contrasted to typemock in that it offers a set of facilities outside of moq and or rhinomocks sweet spot
