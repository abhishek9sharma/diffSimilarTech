default,type,#pkcs12
instead you can support more than the jks and try the default keystore type and if it fails try the #pkcs12

default,implementation,format,better,single,entries
in this default implementation the jks format is better suited for a single keystore that is to handle both trusted entries and key entries in the same container

storage,formats,standard,stronger,protection
i believe the storage formats were either jks the standard java keystore jceks a java keystore that provides much stronger protection of private keys or pkcs12
