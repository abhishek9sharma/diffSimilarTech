lighter,bullet,purpose,heavy
also pygtk is lighter than wxpython but i ended up bitting the bullet and using wxpython for the same purpose recently it is heavy but it didn t have any affect on the script performance

thanks,better
thanks to opencv i managed to rewrite everything with wxpython which i know better than pygtk

visual,appeal,pyqt,tkinter,standard
now all that said...you might get more visual appeal with pygtk pyqt or wxpython though tkinter coming standard is a nice feature
