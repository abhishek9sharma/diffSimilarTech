implication,small,memstore,faster,smaller
the implication is that if you re writing a lot of small puts your memstore fflush will run faster but will produce smaller hfiles on disk than expected

batch,better,single,rpc,size,buffer
for batch puts it s better if you construct a list of puts and then call because it uses a single rpc call to commit the batch but depending on the size of the list write buffer may fflush it all or not
