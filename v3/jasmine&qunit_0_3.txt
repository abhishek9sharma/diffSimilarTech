testing,possible,better,framework
performing this asynchronous testing is actually possible in qunit but is handled better in another javascript testing framework jasmine js

great,suggestion,better,new
aviran made a great suggestion with qunit but i think jasmine is better suited for new developers because of its readability and bdd -ness

bdd,tests,behavior-oriented
jasmine is clearly more bdd focused than qunit although i could see doing bdd with qunit by describing the tests in a behavior-oriented way
