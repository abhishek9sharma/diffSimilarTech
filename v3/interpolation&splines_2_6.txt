order, fit, lower, ---------------------------------------------------

lower,order,better,advantage,cubic
with a lower order splines that works better but then you lose the advantage of cubic interpolation

linear,trapezodial,better,fit
whether splines or linear trapezodial interpolation is a better fit will depend heavily on your problem

others---------------------------------------------------

points,guassian,elimination,scales,technique,likely
if you are doing more than three points however i would strongly recommend using interpolation as using guassian elimination scales incredibly poorly o n 3 and splines or another interpolation technique are less likely to fail

routine,gsl_interp_cspline_periodic,periodic,conditions,table,errors,comparison,linear,points
edit2 you can try to make a coarse sin grid and use gsl routine gsl_interp_cspline_periodic for splines with periodic conditions to splines that table the splines will reduce the errors in comparison to a linear interpolation you need less points on your table less cache miss

smoother,curvature,continuity
splines are used for smoother interpolation that ensures curvature continuity

fancier,next,step
of course you could do fancier interpolation with a splines being the next step
