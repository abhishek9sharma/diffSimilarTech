better, method, viewwillappear, ---------------------------------------------------

viewwillappear,better,view
you may find using viewdidload rather than viewwillappear or viewdidappear may work better in this case you can set your view up with a loading holding graphic or animation trigger your asynchronous networking call and then once complete display the required information

method,earlier
you could try the block of code in the viewdidload method which is called earlier than viewdidappear

earlier,difference,view
so viewdidload is called slightly earlier than viewdidappear the only difference is that when viewdidappear the view have been already drawn instead in viewdidload the view has still to be drawn

others---------------------------------------------------

answer,guarantee,view,window,point,better,place
i agree with the other answer that it shouldn t be in viewdidload - you ve got no guarantee the view has been added to your window at that point viewdidappear is a better place

network,request,faster,specific,instance,viewcontroller,time
also making the network request in viewdidload will be faster as it called before viewdidappear - but keep in mind viewdidload is only called once for a specific instance of a viewcontroller where as viewdidappear is called every time that instance is displayed again eg

init,loadview,viewwillappear,viewwilllayoutsubviews,multiple,time
actually as per view life cycle the methods are called in following manner init loadview viewdidload viewwillappear viewwilllayoutsubviews called more than once viewdidlayoutsubviews called multiple time and lastly viewdidappear

vc,self,time,method,execution,fitting,tests
also don t present modal vc from self at viewdidload at the time of this method execution the vc is often not yet presented itself viewdidappear is more fitting for such tests

perfect,able,quicker,thumbnailimageattime
it works perfect and i ve been able to call it from viewdidload which was quicker than calling the deprecated thumbnailimageattime from the viewdidappear
