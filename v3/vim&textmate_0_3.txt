large,files,sublimetext,better,legacy,syntax,parsers
textmate isn t known to perform well on large files but sublimetext supposedly performs better than vim on large files and yet supports legacy textmate syntax parsers

powerful,price,tag
vim is more powerful and textmate is worth the price tag

terminal,bindings,text,worse
i like the idea of the of editing inside the terminal and like the key bindings of vim but the text highlighting in my vim is much worse than in textmate
