i found jqplot easier to use with more options and better documentation than flot or graphael

charts,weird,limited,api,best,shot,needs,paper
bluff charts get really weird when scaled to more than 800px flot has a very limited api and the tooltips on multi axis dont work plotkit and jquery visualize doesnt have tooltips and i couldnt find any good documentation on gpraphael my best shot was jqplot which was meeting all my needs until i tried to print it on paper they print unaligned

free,opinion,better,chart,doesnâ,events
jqplot is free in my opinion has better chart than flot it doesnâ t have events

groups,qjplot,support,better,unanswered,group
by looking at the google groups for qjplot and flot the support for jqplot is better lot s of unanswered questions at the flot group
