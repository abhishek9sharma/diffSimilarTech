control, better, output, ---------------------------------------------------

contorl,control,output
using repeater contorl over gridview will give you more control over formating your output

better,suggestion,control,datatable
not necessarily better than the repeater suggestion but another option is to use a gridview control and a datatable data structure

control,tabular,output
the repeater will allow more control over what is rendered instead of rendering a tabular output as in the case of gridview

control,markup
alternatively use a gridview though i find that repeater gives you more control over the emitted markup

understanding, big, difference, ---------------------------------------------------

faster,difference,big
the repeater is still faster than the gridview but the difference shouldn t be big if you code it right

understanding,suitable,faster
in my understanding repeater is most suitable since it faster than gridview

others---------------------------------------------------

better,fine,familiar
maybe a repeater is better but you will be fine with a gridview if you are familiar with it

overhead,compact,master,idatareader
instead of using a gridview i d use a repeater which has less overhead and lets you write more compact html for a smaller payload to the client bind the master idatareader to that repeater

event,events,lower,level
each button raises the correct event but the events never reach the gridview because they are handled at a lower level by the repeater

databases,renderer,listview,dependent,comfort
i think the performance depends a lot on the data provider paging and sorting and filtering the data are easily the most expensive tasks when dealing with databases - so picking a renderer gridview listview repeater is more dependent on your comfort with that particular control

better,decision,friendlier,custom
a repeater might be a better decision than a gridview as they are friendlier for using custom layouts

fewer,templates
repeater has fewer templates then gridview

words,performance,better
in simple words we can say performance of repeater is far better than gridview

bind,method,formview,editing,item
the bind method really isn t for the repeater it s more for the formview or gridview where you are editing just one item in the list not every item in the list

easier,table,itemdatabound,dataset
edit using a gridview might be easier then a table since you only need to bind in the itemdatabound the dataset to the gridview in the repeater
