plot,better
graphing by adding one more scatter plot let me know if there is better idea

plot,framework,plots,single,higher,use,color,background
one way that has been suggested for this in the core plot framework was to create two scatter plots within a single graphing have the higher one use a colored fill then have the lower one use a fill of the same color as the background of the graphing

line,types,hundreds,series,points,clearer
using line graphing types would work but i d rather not as i have potentially hundreds of series and scatter points are clearer
