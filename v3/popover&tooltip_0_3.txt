common,popup
a tooltip has more in common with a popover but they are generally regarded as a popup historically

message,bootstrap,better,modal,user
you can also use bootstraps modal to display your message but personally i think bootstrap popover would be much better than a modal or you can simply display a tooltip asking user to sign up or sign in

arrow,better
not having the tooltip arrow of a popover would be better
