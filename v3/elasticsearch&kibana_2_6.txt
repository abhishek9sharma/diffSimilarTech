webui,better,high
as kibana is the webui for elasticsearch it is better make it high availability

this is too high level to implement this on kibana lets make it more in elasticsearch context

others---------------------------------------------------

odd that elasticsearch is more tolerant than kibana

front-end,opentsdb,grafana,support,functionality,regard
if you would like a unified front-end for elasticsearch and opentsdb you could consider grafana which has support for both elasticsearch and opentsdb but less functionality than kibana in regard to elasticsearch

name,company,open,source,logstash
the new name is meant to clarify that the company is more than just elasticsearch such as the open source logstash and kibana

documentation,tutorials,logstash,information,servers
while i have found plenty of documentation and tutorials about how to actually install and configure elasticsearch logstash and kibana i have found less information about how i should set up the software across my servers to maximize performance
