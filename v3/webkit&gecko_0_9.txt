stricter
webkit is stricter than gecko

api,draft,prefixes,little
it s called web audio api and is currently a draft but is well supported by webkit you ll need to use prefixes and a little less by gecko

slower
anyway i just prefer not to use it because gecko is slower then webkit

better,html5,single-page
somehow webkit seems to do better than gecko on the html5 single-page spec scripts and i can t figure out why at this point

user,agents,requirement,strict
some user agents like those based on gecko implement this requirement and others like those based on webkit are less strict

understanding,good,smaller
my understanding is webkit is pretty good smaller than gecko

anti-aliasing
gecko seems to like anti-aliasing more than webkit

memory,browser
gecko is often considered to consume less memory than webkit but this depends a lot on how the browser is implemented

browsers,operations,quicker
i m developing with canvas too and have found that webkit based browsers in general handle canvas operations quicker than gecko in most cases
