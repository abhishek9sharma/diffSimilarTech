better
for me graphicsmagick is performing far better than imagemagick

fork,faster,fewer
graphicsmagick is a fork of imagemagick that is faster and has fewer bugs this is what flickr uses internally so it should be good enough for you

better,end
after trying both and finding that imagemagick was better but in the end i choose neither and went with graphicsmagick instead

faster,test,conversion
graphicsmagick converted much faster than imagemagick although i did not test conversion with cuda processing

faster,better,multitasking
graphicsmagick also seems to be faster than imagemagick using better multitasking

s3,process,faster
the origin server would get the images from s3 process them using graphicsmagick since it s much faster than imagemagick then serve them

better
i do know imagemagick better than graphicsmagick

fork,years,faster
i keep hearing from some people that graphicsmagick a fork from quite a few years back that branched off from imagemagick is significantly faster than imagemagick

16bit,8bit,speed,faster
also changing your imagemagick install from a 16bit one to a 8bit may improve speed as i belive that is one reason graphicsmagick is faster

faster,file,sizes,higher
graphicsmagick is not that much faster -- and the outputted file sizes are significantly higher than imagemagick

others---------------------------------------------------

easier,anthony,thyssen,excellent,examples,capabilities,aside-processing,parentheses
it would be somewhat easier with imagemagick than graphicsmagick as anthony thyssen has put together some excellent examples - but they rely on imagemagick capabilities such as aside-processing in parentheses which graphicsmagick lacks

q8,slower,secs
i successfully compiled graphicsmagick with q8 but after all it seems about 30 slower than imagemagick 0.3 secs

leaner,meaner
i thought graphicsmagick was supposed to be leaner meaner than imagemagick

extensive,api,documentation
graphicsmagick provides more extensive api documentation than imagemagick

mmmm,developed,respects
mmmm graphicsmagick is somewhat less developed than imagemagick in many respects

pdf,inaccurate,colors,better,job
for a pdf that imagemagick was giving inaccurate colors i found that graphicsmagick did a better job

note,powerful,exactimage,fastest,folk,faster
note that imagemagick is the most powerful exactimage is the fastest and graphicsmagick is a folk of imagemagick which is faster but a little less powerful and has some bugs
