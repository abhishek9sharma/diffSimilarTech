machine,clearer
hex or maybe octal depending on the machine being emulated will be clearer than using decimal since similar opcodes tend to vary in bits not digits


hex is used much more often than octal

popular,users,18-bit,architectures,word,digits
from what i understand octal was more popular than hex among users of 18-bit architectures since a word would be exactly 6 octal digits

easy,easier,thing
hex is easy octal is even easier to convert to and you dont need to do the backward thing for a quick check can reverse it by hand after you see the result

format,popular
apparently octal format was more popular than hex format

mechanism,error-prone
the octal encoding mechanism is less error-prone than hex so i ll demonstrate using octal

compact,octal.
of course you could do the same with octal but hex is even more compact than octal.
