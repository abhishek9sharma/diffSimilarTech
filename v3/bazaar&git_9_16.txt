stuff, perforce, balling, ---------------------------------------------------

balling,numbers,2-4x,slower,mercurial,use
an incredibly rough eye balling of the numbers they posted showed bazaar to be 2-4x slower than either git or mercurial in the use cases tested

look,better,site,superiority,mercurial,subversion,perforce
you may also want to take a look at why git is better than x a site that attempts to convince you of the superiority of git over mercurial bazaar subversion and perforce

articles,slower,mercurial
a lot of articles about bazaar will tell you it is a lot slower than git or mercurial

mercurial,faster,slower,smaller,difference
mercurial is significantly faster than bazaar it s slower than git though by a much smaller difference

subversion,mercurial,better,choices
subversion git mercurial or bazaar would be better choices

stuff,slower
i hear all this stuff about bazaar being slower than git

control, systems, hg, ---------------------------------------------------

control,systems,hg,easier,possible
some version control systems bazaar hg git make this easier than others but it s possible on most

type,flexibility,popular,faster
this type of flexibility is what draws me to bazaar despite the fact that git is wildly more popular and faster

control,systems,mercurial,better,type
but distributed version control systems like git mercurial and bazaar are much better suited for your type of environment than subversion

others---------------------------------------------------

easier,api,unix
bazaar is easier to extend in an api way git is easier to extend in a unix way pipes

note,hg,powerful,stuff
note most recently i have been using bazaar and hg with fully powerful regexps so may be looking for stuff more powerful than git provides

fine,needs,better,usability,user,friendly,explorer,practical,experience,best,similar
it works fine and fits all my needs but recently i found that git works better than bazaar so i decided to use it but i face a problem with git usability because most git s gui not user friendly as bazaar explorer so i want your advice based on a practical experience which best git s gui user friendly or which one is most similar to bazaar explorer

index,staging,area,better,ui
in git you can do the same with playing around in the index staging area but bazaar has a better ui for it

easier
bazaar is imho easier to learn than git

version,tool,imo,simpler
bazaar is a distributed version tool just like git but is imo simpler to setup and use

discoverable,tool,user,able
bazaar is more discoverable if you are given the tool wo any documentation any semi-competent user will be able to use bazaar that s not so true with git
