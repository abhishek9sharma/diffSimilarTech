x,faster,accurate
first of all sqrt x should be faster and more accurate than pow x 0.5 why do you think it s in the library

fast,implementation,faster,x
my question is is fast implementation of pow x 0.5f faster than fast sqrt x

correct,answer,function,time
using sqrt gives the correct answer plus using pow function takes more time

tom,karzes,better,square,roots
and as tom karzes mentioned sqrt is also better than using pow for calculating square roots
