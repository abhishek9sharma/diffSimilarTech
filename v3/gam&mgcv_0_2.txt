loess-based,smooths,package,wider,range
if you want loess-based smooths in the gam try package gam but mgcv has a wider range of penalised regression splines and has a more modern approach to smoothness selection in the individual splines

package,flexible
i try to fit a gam using the gam package i know mgcv is more flexible but i need to use gam here
