data, frequency-domain, pcm, ---------------------------------------------------

uncompressed,pcm,data,better,human
if you ask if a uncompressed wav which contains pcm data is better than mp3 then yes but the question sometimes is how much this better really matters to the human ear and how much postprocessing you have to perform on that data

time-domain,data,file,easier,frequency-domain
either way applying gain and or attenuation to time-domain sample data as in a wav file is much easier than trying to apply these effects to frequency-domain data as in an mp3 file

smaller, files, ability, ---------------------------------------------------

file,smaller
so when you convert a file from wav to mp3 you get a smaller file but you lose audio quality

worried,techno,smaller,memories
now i assume you are worried your techno might not read a compressed mp3 which should be smaller than a wav from my memories

.wav,clips,smaller
ok i am new to audio with unity but despite reading all the unity posts regarding audio adding 2 short .wav clips i heard wav was smaller than mp3 to my app has added over 200mb

smaller,files,duration
you should definitely pick mp3 because they are about 10x smaller than wav files of the same duration

files,larger,additional
wav files are about 3 times larger than mp3 files so it would need 1.8gb additional space to do the conversion

problems,ability,files,smaller
if you are still having problems jdk 8 has the ability to play mp3 files which are significantly smaller than wav you may want to try this

others---------------------------------------------------

faster
just like an mp3 or something wav is probably faster

fileformat,memory,formats
for using a fileformat i thought mp3 uses much less memory than wav because all the formats are based on wav but just compressed

likely,compressive,codec,ogg
it is likely that wav is using a more compressive codec such as mp3 or ogg internally

use,memory,better
first don t use wav as it takes up too much memory mp3 is better

iâ,compromise,quality,lower,file,size,audio,little,poor,wonder
question iâ m seeing some compromise in mp3 quality my converted mp3 is lower file size when compared to wav but my audio quality is little poor than wav wonder if i can increase the quality of the mp3 file

16-,32-bit,files,audible,quality,original,space
the quality difference between 16- and 32-bit wav files is nearly never audible to the human ear on most sound equipment and depending on the quality of the original mp3 will take up more space anyway

smaller,worst,audio,quality,files
i understand that mp3 is much smaller but it has worst audio quality when is compared to wav files
