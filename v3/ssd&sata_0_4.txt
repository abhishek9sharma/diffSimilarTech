time,boot,link,speed,reboot
with this set each time you boot and the sata negotiated link speed of the ssd is less than 3 it s going to reboot until it s 3 however many times it takes

time,standard,drive,lower,price,keys
as compilation is mostly reading small files i wonder if buying a fast usb key to work on can speed up compilation time compared to a standard sata drive and with a lower price than an ssd drive 16gb keys are 30

disks,faster,hdd,model
the ssd disks are from 4 to 8 times faster than a sata hdd depending on the model

disk,connections,etc.,cpu,power
using faster disk connections sata etc. and or upgrading to a ssd might help but more cpu power will not
