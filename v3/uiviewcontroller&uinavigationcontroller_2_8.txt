rotations, settoolbaritems, class, ---------------------------------------------------

class,better,rotations
the uinavigationcontroller class seems to handle better rotations than uiviewcontroller

settoolbaritems,animated,better
or there should also be a method settoolbaritems animated on the uiviewcontroller not the uinavigationcontroller which is perhaps better

others---------------------------------------------------

3c,longer,height
3c why does my uiviewcontroller which is inside my uinavigationcontroller has a longer height than the uinavigationcontroller

behind-the-scenes,organizer
the uinavigationcontroller is more of a behind-the-scenes organizer for holding and displaying other uiviewcontroller s

actual,current,uitabbarcontroller,morenavigationcontroller
basically if the user is on a view under the more tab the actual current uinavigationcontroller you want to use to push a uiviewcontroller onto is the uitabbarcontroller s morenavigationcontroller property

framespace,smaller,view,uinavigationbar
the framespace for the uiviewcontroller becomes smaller because uinavigationcontroller manipulates the view by adding a uinavigationbar which is 44.0f in size

uitabbarcontroller
add one more uinavigationcontroller between uitabbarcontroller and uiviewcontroller


the app uses a uinavigationcontroller that never has more than 1 uiviewcontroller on it s stack
