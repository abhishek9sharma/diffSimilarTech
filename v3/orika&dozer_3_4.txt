small, different, collections, ---------------------------------------------------

faster,slower,small,collections
i tested orika and it was a lot faster but was slower than dozer with small collections

jmapper,great,reflection,different,slower
i know that orika and jmapper are great libraries from google and they use reflection in a different way than for example dozer which is much slower they se reflection to generete code somehow

faster,close,manual
orika is way faster than dozer and quite close to manual mapping

others---------------------------------------------------

application,use,better,mapping,reflection
performance will depends on your application use cases basically orika perform better than dozer or other mapping reflection based frameworks because it use bytecode generation behind the scenes
