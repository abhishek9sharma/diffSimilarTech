mean, np, best, ---------------------------------------------------

np,best,time,harder,problems
if there exists a np-hard problem that is not in np to the best of my knowledge no such problem has been proved to fall in this category at this moment of time such problem is harder than np-complete problems

mean,problems,harder
is that mean np-hard problems that are not np-complete are harder

easier,polynomial,time
it is not easier than the np-complete problem since it can be reduced to it in polynomial time which makes the problem np-hard

others---------------------------------------------------

harder
as i understand it an np-hard problem is not harder than an np-complete problem

subset-sum,variant,decision
the subset-sum problem is hard more precisely it s np-complete which means that your variant is hard too it s not np-complete because it s not a decision problem but it is np-hard
