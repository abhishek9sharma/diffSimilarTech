xml, world, elementtree, ---------------------------------------------------

world,standard,elementtree,faster
while celementtree is fast the world standard lxml library which also implements the elementtree is faster still

faster,parsing,un-parsing,xml,certain
the lxml library is proven much faster for parsing and un-parsing xml but celementtree is much faster for certain kinds of manipulation

others---------------------------------------------------

parent,traversal,slower
as a side-effect of implementing proper parent traversal lxml is a bit slower than celementtree for parsing

fastest,faster
instead doing it with lxml which i found to be the fastest somehow even faster than celementtree
