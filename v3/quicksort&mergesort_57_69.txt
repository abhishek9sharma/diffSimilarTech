recursive, base, calls, ---------------------------------------------------

recursive,calls
quicksort consistently has less recursive calls than mergesort

recursive,base,quicker
that way quicksort can reach recursive base case more quicker than mergesort

faster, algorithm, heapsort, ---------------------------------------------------

slower,heapsort,assumption,comparisons
typically mergesort is slower than heapsort and quicksort but that s usually under the assumption that comparisons are fast

faster,heapsort
normally quicksort is faster than mergesort which is faster than heapsort

faster,circumstances,quadratic
quicksort generally runs faster than mergesort but under some circumstances it can degrade to quadratic running time

algorithm,faster,sequence,objects
the quicksort algorithm is faster than mergesort which is what sorted will get you when called on a sequence of objects via java.util.arrays.sort

standard,parallel,algorithm,slower
i have been testing the practicality of openmp gnu parallel sort algorithms in the c++ standard library and have found the parallel quicksort algorithm to be significantly slower than the mergesort algorithm

faster,algorithm
from what i ve read i was expecting quicksort to be faster than mergesort but on my code it is not so i assume there must be a problem with my quicksort algorithm

slower,susceptibility,pathological
mergesort is slightly slower than quicksort but it does not have quicksort s susceptibility to pathological cases

quadratic,time,linear-log,faster,practice
although quicksort runs in quadratic time as compared to mergesort which runs in linear-log time quicksort is usually faster in practice

faster,easier,tight
quicksort is usually faster than mergesort just because it s easier to code a tight implementation and the operations it does can go faster

faster,smaller,data,sets,quicker,algorithm
i ran the two and while the quicksort was faster for smaller data sets 100 elements and i did verify that it works the mergesort became the quicker algorithm fairly quickly

worst,worse,heapsort,faster,average
worst case for quicksort is actually worse than heapsort and mergesort but quicksort is faster on average

faster,practise,hidden
i have read that quicksort is much faster than mergesort in practise and the reason for this is the hidden constant

faster,place,memory
mergesort - in general mergesort is consistently faster than quicksort however quicksort is done in place and doesn t require allocating memory unlike mergesort

sorting,algorithm,difference,speed,faster
quicksort is a partitioning sorting algorithm you might refer to mergesort which also is a partitioning sorting algorithm the biggest difference is probably the speed quicksort is faster even though both of them are o n log n

tests,results,faster
for the 10 tests on the same list the results should be quite the same at least all showing that quicksort is faster than mergesort or vice vesa

faster,locality,reference
depending on where i look people say quicksort is faster than mergesort due to its locality of reference cache hits etc

int,sizes,slower,faster
however on smaller int sizes quicksort gets slower and mergesort gets faster

ints,memory,worse,heapsort
for 5 000 000 ints still stored in memory quicksort becomes suddenly worse then heapsort and mergesort

average,performance,faster
as many people have noted the average case performance for quicksort is faster than mergesort

faster,random,data
quicksort is approximately 40 faster than mergesort on random data because of fewer data movements

specific,faster,first,test
to be specific the quicksort runs faster than mergesort in the first test case and loses badly in the following 9 tests

helpful,faster,clear,winner
it might be helpful to see why quicksort is usually faster than mergesort since if you understand the reasons you can pretty quickly find some cases where mergesort is a clear winner

faster,worst-case,execution
in most cases quicksort will run faster than mergesort even though the worst-case execution time is longer

better, worst, complexity, ---------------------------------------------------

better,stable,worst
i know mergesort is better since it is stable and doesn t have n 2 as worst case but i required to implement quicksort

worse,complexity,worst,case.
quicksort is worse complexity than mergesort in the worst case.

better,different,kind,application
quicksort is not better it is well suited for a different kind of application than mergesort

likelihood,worst,time,complexity,selection,pivot,worse,pathological
given that it is possible to vastly reduce the likelihood of the worst case of quicksort s time complexity via random selection of the pivot for example i think one could argue that mergesort is worse in all but the pathological case of quicksort

better,time-behavior,worst,average
technically mergesort has a better time-behavior î nlogn worst and average cases than quicksort î n 2 worst case î nlogn average case

instance,better,worst
for instance quicksort can outperform mergesort although mergesort is provably better than quicksort in the worst case

cache,hits,better
for example locality of references has influence on cache hits or misses which is the reason why quicksort performs better than mergesort

interesting,answer,better
an interesting answer about this can be found at why is quicksort better than mergesort

clue,size,better,worst,arrays
furthermore you ll have no clue which size it is above which mergesort will perform better on quicksort s worst case arrays as this depends on implementation issues for example one compiler may compile your code in a way that the delete operation in sort4 is very costly in terms of time and so for most reasonably sized arrays sort3 might turn out to be always faster

space,better,linkedlists
mergesort may use more space than quicksort i m not entirely sure and merge may be better for linkedlists

better, simpler, parallelizing, ---------------------------------------------------

better
previously discussed on so why is quicksort better than mergesort

faster
quicksort is implemented well it is typically 2-3 times faster than mergesort or

simpler,in-place
parallelizing mergesort is simpler than quicksort in-place

better
i ve looked at the question at why is quicksort better than mergesort

simpler,parallelizing
i would say that the quicksort is simpler for parallelizing than the mergesort

better
is quicksort always better than mergesort

better
why is quicksort better than mergesort

better
quicksort is not better than mergesort

faster
it s because that quicksort is generally faster that people use it instead of mergesort

worse
scenarios when quicksort is worse than mergesort

better
quicksort usually is better than mergesort for two reasons

implementation, bit, odd, ---------------------------------------------------

callback,function,libc,implementation,slower,random,input
when comparison function is a callback function like in quicksort libc implementation quicksort is slower than mergesort by 15 on random input and 30 for already sorted array for 64 bit integers

implementation,std,compiler,odd,pattern,bit,integers,faster
when comparing my quicksort implementation with std sort on my compiler and my implementation of mergesort i noticed an odd pattern on large data sets when operating on 64 bit integers quicksort is consistently faster than mergesort

practice, typical, variants, ---------------------------------------------------

practice,longer,variants,real,world
in practice it ll take longer than quicksort which is why quicksort variants are favored over mergesort in the real world

smaller,collections,faster,lead,specific
you can also see that for smaller collections quicksort is faster but then mergesort takes the lead but all of this is case specific so take your time to study all 4 algorithms

bad,worst,typical,implementations,faster,practice
quicksort has a bad worst case while mergesort is always o n log n guaranteed but typical quicksort implementations are faster than mergesort in practice

comparisons, number, efficient, ---------------------------------------------------

number,comparisons,efficient
purely in terms of the number of comparisons performed is mergesort always more efficient than quicksort

comparisons,average
interestingly quicksort performs more comparisons on average than mergesort - 1.44 n lg n expected for quicksort versus n lg n for mergesort

comparisons
mergesort uses about 30 less comparisons than quicksort

others---------------------------------------------------

complicated,solid,implementation
quicksort is also more complicated than mergesort especially if you want to write a really solid implementation and so if you re aiming for simplicity and maintainability merge sort becomes a promising alternative with very little performance loss

benefit,time,worse,event
the benefit of mergesort is the guaranteed o n log n run time where as quicksort can be much worse in the event of poor pivot point sampling

factor,larger
also depending on radix sort s radix size its constant factor may be larger than quicksort s mergesort s log factor

optimal,advantage,primitives
also note that quicksort is generally more optimal than mergesort see this as well which explains why it s taken advantage of when sorting primitives

version,single-linked,interesting,puzzle,easier,lists
one can implement a version of quicksort for a single-linked list but normally this is only interesting as a puzzle since mergesort is much easier to implement and works equally well or better for sorting linked lists

sensitive,input,sortedness,positive
quicksort is more sensitive to input sortedness in a positive way than mergesort

natural,lists
mergesort is more natural to implement for linked lists but you can do quicksort very nicely

quicker,debate,topic
i had been taught that quicksort is almost always quicker than mergesort and i understand that there is some debate on this topic but i at least expected it to be closer than this

mutable,useful,functional,setting,better
quicksort is generally regarded as mutable and may therefore be less useful in a functional setting but mergesort is generally better suited for a functional setting

swaps,stackoverflow,discussion,sort
i do know though that quicksort has more compares but less swaps than mergesort which i learned from another stackoverflow discussion quicksort vs merge sort

comparisons,cheap,little,faster,time,pointers
it turns out that if comparisons are cheap mergesort tends to run a little faster because quicksort spends more time fiddling with pointers

biggest,difference,detriment,lists,number,ties,better,great
the biggest difference that can be produced between the two of them will always be to quicksort s detriment and it involves lists that are already largely sorted or contain a large number of ties when quicksort does better than mergesort the difference will not be nearly so great

better,locality,reference,accesses,faster,corresponding
quicksort has better locality of reference than mergesort which means that the accesses performed in quicksort are usually faster than the corresponding accesses in mergesort

sorts,insertion,sort,worse,kinds,data
this means that while the two underlying sorts it uses mergesort and insertion sort are both worse than quicksort for many kinds of data timsort only uses them when it is advantageous to do so

hard,worst,log2n,-n+1,+,best,equals,k,.if,infinite.so,better
that s hard to say.the worst of mergesort is n log2n -n+1 which is accurate if n equals 2 k i have already proved this .and for any n it s between n lg n - n + 1 and n lg n + n + o lg n .but for quicksort its best is nlog2n also n equals 2 k .if you divide mergesort by quicksort it equals one when n is infinite.so it s as if the worst case of mergesort is better than the best case of quicksort why do we use quicksort
