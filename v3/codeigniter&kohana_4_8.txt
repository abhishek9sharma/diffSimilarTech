thing,time,better
and a thing about codeigniter i asked some time ago people about it and most says that kohana based on codeigniter is better

you had a better chance with kohana 2.3.4 as it was derived from codeigniter and was similar

others---------------------------------------------------

flexible,great,base
overall kohana is more flexible than codeigniter and a great base to build a web application and api on

little,bit,easier,programmers,better
i ve came to kohana from codeigniter which was a little bit bigger documentation and easier to understood but as far as i found out many programmers say that kohana are alot better than codeigniter

assumption,modules,effort,fewer
is the assumption that codeigniter modules work in kohana or at least can be massaged to without too much effort or is it just that kohana s got fewer modules

bloat,bloated,fork
but if codeigniter has a bit too much bloat for you maybe you can try kohana which is a bit less bloated than codeigniter started as a fork

flexible,internal
in kohana for example also codeigniter but kohana is more flexible you can build internal requests with

symfony,powerful,first,version
the documentation sucks but it s very lightweight there s a good community even on so it s more simple than symfony and more powerful than codeigniter the first version of kohana was based on codeigniter
