sort, effective, ---------------------------------------------------

sort,effective
so arraylist and sort is more effective than treeset

effective
so i expected that treeset would be more effective then arraylist

others---------------------------------------------------

note,hashset,collections.sort,efficent,better
note using treeset instead of hashset would give directly sorted arraylist and above collections.sort could be skipped but treeset is otherwise less efficent so it s often better and rarely worse to use hashset even when sorting is needed
