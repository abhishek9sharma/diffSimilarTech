thread,earlier
that code is all being launchd from a daemons thread created earlier

launchagent,path,bin,file,argument,mongod,launchctl
what i thought is that if i can configure launchagent or daemons then i will provide path to mongod of bin directory of mongodb folder and provide --config and path for .conf file as argument and then i need to just launchd mongod using launchctl with name mongod and it will start

easier,agent,session,different,corner
maybe it is but it is much easier than launchd agent in other session from daemons when implemented right with different corner cases support

control,background,processes,host,things,gem
if you want more control over launchd background processes from ruby including properly detaching ttys and a host of other things check out the daemons gem
