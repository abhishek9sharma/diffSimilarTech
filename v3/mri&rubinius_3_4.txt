choices, web, yarv, ---------------------------------------------------

web,application,jruby,better
for longer-running applications like a web application rubinius or jruby will generally perform better than mri

better,jruby,efficiency,gvl,global
works on some rubies better than others jruby and rubinius are recommended efficiency on mri is decreased due to gvl global vm lock

tests,scripts,yarv,better,choices
in practice this means that deploying a rails app to jruby is a good idea as is running your integration tests but for developer unit tests and scripts mri yarv or rubinius are better choices

others---------------------------------------------------

things,unicorn,version,puma,concurrency,easier,global,lock
something where the app is about serving different pages you want low memory and good context switching things like preforking unicorn or running on the rubinius version of ruby with puma that makes concurrency easier to code because it will perform well with threading as opposed to something like mri with a global interpreter lock
