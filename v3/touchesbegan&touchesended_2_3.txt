greater, touch, current, ---------------------------------------------------

value,greater,active,touch
if the value of touchesbegan is greater than touchesended then an active touch is going on

value,seconds,current,time,hint
if the value of touchesended is more than 3 seconds beyond the current time and the time of touchesbegan is still before touchesended then it s time to show your hint

motion,smoother,touchesmoved
btw for extra credit if you are using ios 3.2 or 4.0 or later use the uipangesturerecognizer class to handle the drag and drop logic - the drag and drop motion is a lot smoother than overriding touchesbegan touchesmoved touchesended .
