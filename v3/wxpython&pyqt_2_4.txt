easier,hard,attractive,looks
at least they are much easier to intall even pyqt is hard to code for me and wxpython is less attractive when it comes to looks

easier,tkinter,framework
wxpython is probably easier than pyqt or tkinter i don t want to start a framework war

others---------------------------------------------------

words,possible,popular,os,portable,tkinter
two words of warning against wxpython it is not possible to install it via the popular fink package manager on mac os x currently which makes it far less portable than pyqt and tkinter
