pyopenssl,popular,well-maintained
i chose to rely only on pycrypto and pyopenssl since m2crypto is less popular and not well-maintained which is a hazard from both compatibility pypy and security perspectives

little,better
what little i ve used pycrypto i ve found m2crypto to be a better library overall -- you might want to try it out
