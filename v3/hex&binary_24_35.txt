data, useful, program, ---------------------------------------------------

readable,data,dump
hex is somewhat more readable than binary if i happen to be loading a data dump in a text editor etc

readable,useful
and because hex is much more readable and useful than binary - it s often used and shown

program,data,simpler
my program reads from binary data and i am just displaying it in hex to make it simpler

data,easier
binary data is typically represented in hex to make it easier to read and reference

decimal, conversion, octal, ---------------------------------------------------

values,decimal,conversion,computation
generally hex values are preferred over decimal values as the conversion to binary from hex involves less computation than the conversion from decimal

conversion,octal,easier,decimal
the conversion between binary and either octal or hex is even easier than decimal

usability,standpoint,representation,better,numbers
it seems the from a readability and usability standpoint the hex representation is a better way of defining binary numbers

easier,decimal
that s one reason why going from hex to binary is much easier than from decimal to binary

verbose,number
hex is just less verbose and can express anything a binary number can

decimal,easier,head,first,representation,number
converting between decimal and hex is more involving and at least to me it s been easier if i have to do it in my head to first convert the decimal into binary representation and then the binary number into hex

convenient,digit,0-f,groups,bits,single
as others have pointed out hex is much more convenient than binary anyway - you just need to remember how each of the hex digit 0-f looks in binary and replace groups of 4 bits with a single hex digit

human,looks,editor,easier
but when anyone human looks at it they look at it in hex using a hex editor which is much easier than reading binary

anyone,floating-point,digits,better
so i m wondering if anyone knows of a way i could implement either a floating-point to binary digits function or better yet floating-point to hex

straightforward,decimal,instance
you ll see converting from binary to hex is much more straightforward than from decimal to hex for instance

conversion,simpler,digit,corresponding,0xa4
the conversion from hex to binary is even simpler since you can simply expand each hex digit into the corresponding binary for example 0xa4 - 1010 0100

width,characters,conversion,faster,decimal
this is still accepted by calls like inet_addr and has several advantages all fields are fixed width there are only 8 characters to update and the binary to hex conversion is usually faster than binary to decimal

decimal,number,digits
i have made it so that the binary properly converts to base ten decimal and the decimal properly converts to hex but it only works if the binary number is less than 5 digits 01101 correctly turns out 16 and 11111 turns 1f but something like 11010110 stupidly becomes 6 here s my code

little,practice,octal,easier,human
with a little practice hex or octal are easier for a human than binary

octal,shorter,ways
hex and octal are just shorter ways to write binary

important,alot,shorter,easier,humans
one important reason is because hex is alot shorter and easier to read than binary is for humans

memory, template, command, ---------------------------------------------------

results,template,easier,raw,bytes
the results of running a binary template are much easier to understand and edit than using just the raw hex bytes

memory,command,easier,solution
- i usually find debugging memory in hex x command is easier than binary so i will not use my solution

editors, editing, computer, ---------------------------------------------------

data,editing,paint.net,friendlier,editors
i ve been using images to store data since editing binary data through paint.net is much friendlier than most hex editors

editors,tool,computer,data,readable,format
hex editors are more of a tool for geeks as they also give you the computer data in hex a more readable format compared to binary

others---------------------------------------------------

easier,heads,numbers,blocks,size,byte,digits,notation,clunky
hex is easier for most people to convert to and from binary in their heads since binary numbers are usually expressed in blocks of eight because that s the size of a byte and eight is exactly two hex digits but hex notation would have been clunky and misleading in dennis time implying the ability to address 16 bits

simplification,things,easier,programmer,data,next
if we use hex because it s a simplification of binary that makes things easier on the programmer is easier to read than binary and carries more data etc. why do we not jump to the next logical step base64

display,better
originally i was looking for a binary display but this hex display is much better for viewing

format_int,loops,dec
format_int in binary case it loops 4 times then 4 times more than hex and dec cases

values,odd,standard,prefix,numbers,larger,magnitude,representation
those hex values seem a bit odd they re powers of two in decimal but in any case 0x128 the 0x is a standard prefix for hex numbers is the larger of the numbers in magnitude and its binary representation is 100101000

instances,arbitrary,data,text,overhead,better,notation
base64 is usually used in instances to represent arbitrary binary data in a text format it has a 33.3 overhead but that s better than say hex notation which has a 50 overhead

bits,greater,decimal,not-valid,number,ff,blank,space
if the 4 bits are greater than 1001 binary 9 decimal then you want to interpret that as a not-valid number and i guess ff hex is to be interpreted as a blank space

encoding,readable,sublime,uses
hex encoding is far more readable than binary that s why sublime uses it

space,longer,records,straight,method
unfortunately using hex consumes way more space and takes significantly longer i m dealing with 500gb of data and around 1 2 million records so i would really like to get the straight binary method to work

right,side,greater,equal,false
if the right side the binary side is greater than or equal to the hex side then you print true if not then you print false

string,longer,corresponding
a hex string is significantly longer than the corresponding binary string
