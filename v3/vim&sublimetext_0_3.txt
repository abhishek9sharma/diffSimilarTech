easier,everyone,taste
personally i m using sublimetext right now which i find easier than vim for searching and navigating the code but everyone has their taste

webstorm,accessible,editor,mine
sublimetext or webstorm are far more accessible than vim so it usually happens with their editor rather than mine

large,files,better
textmate isn t known to perform well on large files but sublimetext supposedly performs better than vim on large files and yet supports legacy textmate syntax parsers
