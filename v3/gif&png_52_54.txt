better, format, file, ---------------------------------------------------

animated,better,file,size
animated png is better than gif if we re focused on file size Ã¢ achieving a smaller file size was one of the reasons the apng format was designed

better,use,format
while png is definitely better that gif occasionally there is a use case for needing to stay in gif format

images,lossless,better,competition
png images are always compressed lossless but their compression algorithm works better than competition gif

kind,thing,better
jpeg is bad at that kind of thing and you ll probably find png to compress better probably better than gif too

system,better
for example given gif may be deprecated in a system because png has proven better for the system s users - perhaps because it supports better colour depth preserving the colours more accurately or svg might be deprecated because some clients have been found to be using web browsers that won t display them jpeg might be deprecated because it s known the images in the system aren t natural photographic images and the format gives visually poor results despite larger compressed files slower processing speed and higher memory usage - lots of possible motivations for making things deprecated

format,better,compression
according to wikipedia the png format provides better compression than gif

better,size.
many people don t know about 8-bit png which is usually better than gif in size.

animations,apng,better
png does everything except animations unless enhanced with apng that gif does and better

file,size,better,choices
for storing line drawings text and iconic graphics at a smaller file size png or even gif are better choices because they are lossless

edge,better,format,larger
there might be some edge cases where gif is slightly better because the png format may have a slightly larger overhead from metadata but it s really not worth the worry

newer,format,better,jpeg,screenshots
png is a newer format and often better than either jpeg of gif - especially for screenshots

better,alpha,result
png gives you better alpha result than gif

non-animated,images,conversion,painless,beneficial,better
for non-animated gif images a conversion to png8 should be painless and beneficial as png compresses much better

better,colors,time
png compresses much better than gif and allows more colors at the same time

better,support,transparency,jpeg
for example png has better support for transparency than gif or jpeg

better, compression, mode, ---------------------------------------------------

capable,image,mode,animation,better,compression
png is capable of every image mode of gif apart from animation and when using the same image mode png will have better compression due to its superior deflate algorithm compared to lzw

general,rule,worse,better,superior,compression
as a general rule png is never worse and often better than gif because of superior compression

regard,smaller,alpha,transparency,pixels,transparent,opaque,images,colors
but in that regard it is replaced by png which is generally smaller supports alpha transparency where gif pixels are either fully transparent or fully opaque and most importantly gif images are limited to 256 colors

imagecopy,image,background,imagepng,output,better,compression,colors
you can then use imagecopy to insert each gif image including the background and imagepng to generate png output which is better for line art than jpeg offers better compression than gif and can support more than 256 colors

smaller, color, palette, ---------------------------------------------------

smaller,average
convert it to png 10-30 smaller than gif on average

index-color,files,smaller,doxygen
since that appears to generate index-color gif files which are smaller than the png files that doxygen generates

smaller,delay
after pressing it about twice there is a smaller and smaller delay between the gif being set and the png being set

wider,color,pallete,properitary
png has a wider color pallete than gif and gif is properitary while png is not

smaller,optimisation,progams
if png isn t smaller than gif then your software may be saving it poorly - look for png optimisation progams like pngout and pngnq

thing,note,smaller,palette,colors
one thing to note is that gif supports a smaller palette than png - only up to 256 colors

colors,smaller,time
indexed png less than 256 colors is actually always smaller than gif so i use that most of the time

smaller,colour,group,pixels
gif is smaller because it s based on an colour palette of 256 colours rather than the separate rgb values for each pixel or group of pixels in jpg and png

message,image,larger
now i want to show an error message when the image isn t a png jpg or gif or is larger than 250k

icon,size,smaller
icon size indexed png is often smaller than the same gif

color,palette,smaller
but keep in mind that the gif color palette is way smaller than png

file, size, files, ---------------------------------------------------

file,size,jpeg
i used gif because its file size 2.1kb was considerably less than png or jpeg in this case

files,larger,equivalent,source,image
if your png files are coming out larger than equivalent gif files it is almost certainly because your source image has more than 256 colors

files,larger,file,size
png files have a larger default pallet however you can shrink their color pallet so that when you do they result in a smaller file size than gif

aware,worse,file,size
i wasn t aware that png should be any worse in terms of file size than gif

file,image,jpeg,size
this properly means if the file is an image of gif or jpeg or png and is less than that size

applications,files,larger,simple,graphics
jpg and png work well for most applications but the files will be larger than gif for very simple graphics

wewtaco,file,wider,dimension,black
wewtaco i noticed that your png file has wider dimension than the gif file and i am guess that could be a reason the black bars are showing up

file,smaller,oh,images
it might help to reduce your gif file sizes smaller oh and i believe -depth 8 can only be used for png images

matters,larger,files
i m not sure if this matters but the gif is significantly larger than the png files

bmp, map, webp, ---------------------------------------------------

jpeg,bmp,webp,svg,map
jpg jpeg bmp png webp gif svg js map ico css less scss

jpeg,bmp,standard
gif jpeg png bmp are more standard than any vector format where usually adobe has the market

uglier, strings, likely, ---------------------------------------------------

search,images,shorter,base64,strings
but in my search i found that png images return shorter base64 strings than gif images

note,files,images,likely,uglier,colors
note that if you convert your png files to gif images they are likely to look uglier as gif files can only have 256 colors and do not support alpha-transparency

others---------------------------------------------------

transparent,background,file,colors,smaller,good
just press save and give it a name and that photoshop image will be saved into a transparent background png file which presents more colors and it s smaller than a gif file and is as good as a jpg

files,larger,equivalent,bit,color,palette,mode
if you find png files are larger than the equivalent gif files then you re saving the png in 24 bit color and the gif in palette mode because a gif is always in palette mode

conversion,trivial,colour,transparency,limited
bear in mind that the conversion is not trivial if the png is true colour or has transparency gif is more limited

simple,smaller,footprint,version
still most simple gif usually are much more smaller in footprint compared to their optimized png version

jpeg,complex,data
gif jpeg and png are more complex - the data is compressed

script,image,width
so this script will take a jpg gif of png image resize it to 110px width if width is greater of 110px height if height is greater

8-bit,shim,smaller,dimension,pixel
a 8-bit png shim is smaller than the same dimension 1 pixel gif and everything will still work as planned

achieves,better,compression,pre-filtering,step,wikipedia,explanation,filtering
png achieves better compression than gif because it applies a pre-filtering step before the lossless compression deflate roughly equivalent to lzw. see wikipedia s explanation of png filtering

bigger,alos,cant,use
also if i change all to png is not bigger and alos i am using prawn pdf outputting these images so cant use gif

paul,static,line,art,better,situation
paul points out that png compresses static line art better than gif for nearly every situation

format,capable
the gif format is substantially less capable than png
