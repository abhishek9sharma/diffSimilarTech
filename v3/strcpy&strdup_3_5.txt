convenient, faster, result, ---------------------------------------------------

system,willing,implementation,cleaner,malloc
or indeed if your system has strdup or you re willing to write an implementation then strdup is much cleaner than malloc + strcpy

strlen,malloc,memcpy,faster
because of the above replace strdup with strlen malloc memcpy memcpy is slightly faster than strcpy

convenient,strlen,malloc,identical,result
additionally if you have strdup then it is much more convenient than strlen + malloc + strcpy with identical result including the same obligation to free the allocated storage when you no longer need it

others---------------------------------------------------

current,buffer,earlier
in current code you actually don t really copy you will have to do strcpy buffer s unless using the strdup mentioned earlier

memory,callee,nicer,function,opinion
in general it is nicer in c to have the caller allocate memory not the callee - hence why strcpy is a nicer function in my opinion than strdup
