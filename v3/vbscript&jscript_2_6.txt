bat, simpler, segment, ---------------------------------------------------

inclusion,batch,file,simpler,translation,small,segment,vbs,problematic
the inclusion of jscript code into a batch file is simpler than vbscript and the translation of a small code segment from vbs to jscript is not problematic

suggest,scripting,file,use,.cmd,.bat,readable,powerful
...i suggest doing all of the scripting from within the vbscript file and avoiding the use of .cmd .bat files completely if you can as vbscript is much more readable and powerful though i prefer using the jscript language instead but that s just me

others---------------------------------------------------

contrary,c-like,explicit,paths,sensitive
on contrary jscript is more c-like do not require explicit enabling of script running accepts relative paths case sensitive and loosely typed both are imho advantages for scripting language compared to vbscript

experienced,shot,takers
i am much more experienced with vbscript than jscript but i will give it a shot since not many takers on this question

asp,better,cleaner,simpler,nicer,job,joy,head,ache
asp with jscript is 100 times better cleaner simpler nicer than vbscript and makes my job a joy rather than a vbscript head ache

wont,fan,asp.net,elegant,arguments,collection
when writing code in jscript as i am wont to do as i have never been a fan of asp.net and jscript is infinitely more elegant than vbscript you can call upon the arguments collection
