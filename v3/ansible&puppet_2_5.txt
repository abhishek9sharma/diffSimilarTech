others---------------------------------------------------

httpd,simple,program,actual,task
if you just expect puppet to restart httpd simple because you asked it to then you either need to use a program like ansible which is more of an actual task manager or use some kind of inotify thing to see that a certain file has been changed so httpd must be restarted

puppet chef always have a place in my heart stack but ansible is just easier
