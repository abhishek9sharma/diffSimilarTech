willing, cleaner, posix, ---------------------------------------------------

system,willing,implementation,cleaner,strcpy
or indeed if your system has strdup or you re willing to write an implementation then strdup is much cleaner than malloc + strcpy

willing,posix,cleaner,strlen,semantics,responsibility
as i noted in comments however if you re willing to rely on posix s strdup then that s cleaner than strlen + malloc + and has the same semantics you take responsibility for freeing the memory allocated for the copy

memory, free, programmer, ---------------------------------------------------

things,programmer,worse,free,memory,null
in c memory most other things are managed by the programmer so strdup is no worse than forgetting to free malloc ed memory failing to null terminate a string using incorrect format string in scanf and invoking undefined behaviour accessing dangling pointer etc

memory,pointer,original,impossible,free
you should know that strdup allocates more memory and returns its pointer which you then overwrite the original pointer returned by malloc so it will be impossible to free that memory since you no longer have the pointers

simpler, convenient, identical, ---------------------------------------------------

strlen,memcpy
because of the above replace strdup with strlen malloc memcpy memcpy is slightly faster than strcpy

separate,original,simpler,strlen,call
you can use either to create a new memory block which is separate from the original but naturally strdup is simpler since it doesn t require a separate malloc strlen call

convenient,strlen,strcpy,identical
additionally if you have strdup then it is much more convenient than strlen + malloc + strcpy with identical result including the same obligation to free the allocated storage when you no longer need it

others---------------------------------------------------

better,work,function,calloc,able
he cried. will save the string on the static storage and you will not be able to do most of the function on them you better work with strdup in your function or malloc and calloc to be able to use all the function

values,lines,input
i ve never used malloc to store more than values but i have to use strdup to order the lines of an input file and i dont get a way to make it work
