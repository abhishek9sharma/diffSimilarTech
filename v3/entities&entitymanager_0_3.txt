annotations,postgresql,database,config,file,control,tables,doctrine,files
i know i worked with annotations to improve my entities to create a postgresql database and tables with correct behavior and modified my config file to use entitymanager to have more control over which tables tables to create but i don t know if that error comes from there as i use doctrine annotations in these entities files

breeze,stores,single,memory,use,entitymanager.
each breeze entitymanager stores a single copy of each entity by key so memory use should not expand unless you are retrieving more entities or using more than one entitymanager.

slower,results
when hibernate s entitymanager is tracking 100 000 entities it is 100x slower than when it is tracking only a few see results below
