faster, slower, memory, ---------------------------------------------------

faster,io
ram is much faster then disk io

slower
that means that without caching a hit against disk will be 200 times slower than accessing ram

ssd,good,slower
ssd disk are good but they are still much slower than ram

io,orders,magnitude,slower
it won t do anything to change the fact that disk io is orders of magnitude slower than ram

slow,hard,slower
this is relatively slow since reading from the hard disk is slower than reading from ram

faster,hard
the ram is much faster than the hard disk

faster,data,able
ram is a lot faster than disk so reads and writes are temporarily stored until the data is requested by the code or the disk is able to receive it

query,speed,slower,cpu
query speed is mainly limited by disk i o speed which is at least 1000 times slower than cpu ram speed

slower
remember disk is 1000s of times slower than ram

memory,alway,faster,io
buy as much memory as you can afford ram is alway faster than io from disk

slower
i think it is because the disk is slower than ram

faster
ram is much faster than disk

access,slower
disk access is much slower than ram

benefit,reading,faster
1 yes there is a obvious benefit reading from ram is faster than reading from disk

memory,leisure,faster
for this reason it seemed natural to me to initially load the file into memory and interpret it later at my leisure since reading from ram is supposed to be much faster than from disk

faster
ram is a lot faster than disk

operations,memory,faster,file
for the stand of file operations writing to memory ram is always faster than writing to the file on the disk directly

assumption,faster
my assumption in the question above is that disk is as fast as ram or faster than ram

access,memory,faster,hard
we all know that the access to ram memory is faster than access to hard disk

faster,database,access
ram is 100 thousand times faster than disk for database access from

slower,machine,practical
as disk is 1000s of times slower than ram this problem can grind the machine down to a practical halt

queries,data,slower
as you run queries it has to fetch data from disk which is much slower than ram

orders,magnitude,slower
disk io - even ssd - is many orders of magnitude slower than the ram that the hashing is going though

data,slower,sorting
run the following to sort the data on disk this is slower than pulling it into ram sorting and then writing to disk

memory,faster,io,slower,multiple
when the data is in memory - you can do anything much faster on it since disk io is extremely slower then ram so sorting it and reading it multiple times is expected to be much slower then manipulating the data on memory

drives,cheaper,faster
disk drives and ram are getting cheaper much faster than your time is

read,slower
only one disk read - since the disk is much slower then ram -

thousands,faster,speed
i understand that ram is typically thousands of times faster than disk but i o speed is not the only code running

io,slower
but you should consider that disk io is way slower than ram

performance,loss,slower
anyway you will have a huge performance loss due to the fact that your disk is way slower than your ram

faster,processors,demand
when disk get faster then so does ram and processors and the demand on devices

faster,array.
if so just throw in some more ram or get a faster disk array.

slower
disk i o is about 100 000 times slower than ram

initial,read,slower
the initial read has to access the disk which is a lot slower than accessing ram

memory,slower
if too much memory is consumed it might swap to disk which is slower than ram

thousands,faster
memory is thousands of times faster than disk so if something gets read often having it in ram is drastically faster

slower,memory,usage
as disk is 1000s of times slower than ram as the memory usage increases your machine grinds more and more closer to a halt

faster,cpu
loosely speaking ram is 1000 or more times faster than disk and cpu is faster still

cache,efficient,faster
obviously reading a block from cache is much more efficient than reading it off the disk since ram is much faster than disk

support,cache,faster
no trivial support for cache accessing ram is faster than accessing disk

tuples,slower,access,things
remember the tuples are saved into the disk which is vastly slower to access than things in ram

job,slow,shuffle,slower
or if there is too much intermediate output to be shuffled your job will become slow as you will need disk based shuffle in such a case which will be slower than ram based shuffle

idea,application,faster
the idea is to get the library and application loaded from ram into ram which is much faster than loading from disk

slower,info
which will lead to performance issue all programs will be work slower because read info from disk is slower than from ram

practical,considerations,slower
so even ignoring practical considerations like disk is slower than ram it will be slower

access,orders,magnitude,slower
because disk access is orders of magnitude slower than ram access

faster
ram is always faster than disk

buffering,important,slower,cpu
caching and buffering are quite important since disk are just so much slower than ram and ram is much slower than the cpu

share,memory,faster,io,operation
just wanted to weigh in my two cents what serialworm and thephpdeveloper said share the fact that memory ram is much faster than any disk io bound operation you come up with

io,slower
disk io will be slower than ram

things,calulations,slower
if the worker processes do other things than just calulations read from or write to disk they will have to wait a lot since a disk is a lot slower than ram

slower
disk is 100x slower than ram

themore,data,cache,faster
get more ram themore ram you have the more data can live in cache which is 1000 times faster than reading from disk

swap,file,slower
changing it will require a reboot. that will slow things down a bit as the swap file on disk is much slower than ram

orders,magnitude,slower
disk even ssd are orders of magnitude slower than ram

expensive, data, scarce, ---------------------------------------------------

quantities,data,expensive
however they may be cheaper to operate depending on how much data you are expecting to store with each session key holding large quantities of data in ram is typically more expensive than storing on disk

expensive,storage
basically ram is more expensive than the disk storage

data,larger,size
i should also mention that this happens once the data is larger than ram and it s increasing size on the disk

life,data,expensive
though writing and reading in the same block of code makes little sense in real life as you should still have the data you ve written and because i o to disk are much more expensive than the ram you were using to keep the data so you may just do

data,crash,expensive,scarce,flash
you lose two benefits of data base consistency data persists after a crash and you need more ram which is more expensive and scarce than disk flash

data,space
data in ram can take a lot more space than on disk

database,systems,expensive,large
relational database systems do their own disk swapping of course partly because they were designed when ram was more expensive and partly because they still sometimes deal with unusually large volumes of data

available, larger, files, ---------------------------------------------------

lookup,repetitions,files,larger,available
it is needed for a lookup of repetitions in disk files much larger than available ram

swap,space,processes,larger
it uses swap space on disk to allow for processes much larger than ram

larger,1gb,space,512mb,ssh,workspaces
the workspace limit is on non-free hosted workspaces any workspace that s private or larger than 1gb disk space and 512mb ram ssh workspaces are unlimited

fragmentation,issues,swap,space,memory,available
the os heap uses the cpu s virtual memory hardware and is free from fragmentation issues and can even effectively use the disk s swap space allowing you to allocate more memory than available ram

file,larger,in-memory,representation,available
edit true the file on disk is not larger than ram but the in-memory representation can easily become much larger than available ram

files,bigger,available,device,network
i ve written my own protocol since i need it to be lightweight and i m sending files that may be bigger than the ram available on the device â â therefore the files are being streamed straight from the network to disk

storage,varnish,io,bottlenecks,larger,available
alternatively you can use an ssd with file storage in varnish to reduce disk io bottlenecks when using an object cache larger than available ram

order,larger,datasets,happy,data,memory,storage
in the past the redis developers experimented with virtual memory and other systems in order to allow larger than ram datasets but after all we are very happy if we can do one thing well data served from memory disk used for storage

structure,larger,network,calls
writing to a local database or handling a data structure larger than ram will impact the disk making network calls will impact the network hardware cpu bound calculations will impact there

file,larger,system,data,swappable
modern operating systems usually get in the way especially if the file is larger than ram you will end up swapping code since the system will treat your already stored on disk data as swappable

larger,available,+,swap,space,process
if you use map_shared | map_noreserve you can use a memory map much larger than available ram + swap -- but if you run out of disk space or quota your process will receive and die from a sigbus signal.

larger,available,server,time,shuffling,files,memory
if your working data set is larger than available ram your server may spend a lot of time shuffling files from disk to memory

future,lists,larger,available
in future these lists may be read from disk and larger than available ram

data,larger,amount,node,documents,available,slower
just because you have data that is larger than your ram amount doesn t mean the node should go down it just means that not all documents will be available in ram and the node will sometimes have to fetch from disk slower

files,bigger,actual,usage
since the files are all bigger than ram this translates to actual disk usage

table, smaller, slowest, ---------------------------------------------------

table,bigger
the table on disk is bigger than your ram

smaller,pixels
that 1st code takes virtually no ram as it creates from the disk making it smaller by simply skipping pixels from the image

table,larger,likely,slowest
it sounds like the table is a lot larger than ram so this means something like 5555 disk reads -- likely to be the slowest part

set,smaller
if the working set is smaller than your ram it should not be disk bound

magnitude,larger,cluster
and the whole purpose of maglev is to have a ruby implementation which can deal with heaps that are orders of magnitude larger than ram by storing them in a distributed cluster on disk

efficient, hit, mysql, ---------------------------------------------------

bigger,machine,space,efficient
the amount of data in stream is bigger than machine ram or its disk space so it needs to relatively efficient

hit,linux,swapfiles,efficient,mysql
thus you would get a small performance hit while linux moved it back into ram swapfiles are more efficient at this than mysql would be moving it from the disk

location,input,different,efficient,sequential
location of the input sorting algorithms on disk are different from algorithms on ram because disk reads are much less efficient when not sequential

cheaper, space, usage, ---------------------------------------------------

work,part,space,overheads
so everything here should require no work on your part not consume more ram not consume more disk space impose no other overheads never freeze and give you a nice speedup

space,cheaper
disk space is probably always going to be cheaper than ram

limits,available,space
i m not sure if or how some other limits are imposed if available disk space or available ram are less than the software limits

space,larger
this is well within disk space but far larger than ram

space,usage,cheaper
this approach will radically reduce heap space usage - disk space is cheaper then ram too

space,cheaper,labor
disk space and ram are far cheaper than your labor and they are cheaper than a delay getting your project completed and into the hands of users

persistence,storage,cheaper
always favor disk persistence disk storage is cheaper than ram

files,size,later,usage
i want to cut large csv files file size more than ram size and use them or save each in disk for later usage

system, typical, modules, ---------------------------------------------------

battery-backed,packages,modules,ultra-fast,scsi,typical,interface,slower,system
there exist battery-backed packages of ram modules which can act as an ultra-fast hdd substitute but if they attach via sata scsi or other typical disk interface the still are slower than system ram

slow,hard,slower,data,page,file,operating,system
this is slow because your hard disk is significantly slower than ram and at 7gb there will be a lot of data being read from your hard disk put into ram then moved back to your page file the file on disk your operating system uses to store data that has been copied out of ram

access, ---------------------------------------------------

access
and ram access is much more fast than disk access

access
more ram means less disk access

4gb, enough, jboss, ---------------------------------------------------

cores,4gb,enough,example,enterprise
for this reason i deployed a 2 cores 4gb ram and more than enough disk to run through the getting started example of the enterprise integrator

jboss,4gb,cpu,enough,space,5gb
this particular jboss runs in a vm with 4gb of ram and 2 cpu s and more than enough disk space it has never has less than 5gb free at any time

amount, random, larger, ---------------------------------------------------

working,amount,performance,things,performant
when your working set exceeds the amount of ram then it will carry on working but with noticeably degraded performance as things will then be constantly having to go to disk which is far less performant

sequential,datasets,larger,random,bottle
so while the writes my be sequential on disk for datasets larger than ram these random reads will quickly become the bottle neck

set,larger,small,number,random,iops
at some point if you re doing randomish queries and your working set is sufficiently larger than ram then you ll be limited by the small number of random iops a disk can do

larger,amount,faster,smaller,4x,136gb
if your data size is larger than the amount of ram you can afford you can try to compensate with faster disk and using more smaller disk 8 x 74gb instead of 4x 136gb

machine, data, computer, ---------------------------------------------------

data,program,slower,long,machine,low
reloading pages data or program code from disk which is much slower does not usually happen very often as long as the program is actually running and as long as the machine is not desperately low on ram

data,fit,machine,performance,important,random,read
if the hot data won t fit in ram on either machine then disk i o performance becomes more important than ram mostly random read i o and the fsync flush rate

volatile,data,computer,power,expensive,unit,storage
but ram is volatile the data in ram is erased when the computer loses power and ram is far more expensive than disk per unit of storage

others---------------------------------------------------

faster,zram,linux,use,paging,older,computers
since using ram is faster than using disk zram allows linux to make more use of ram when swapping paging is required especially on older computers with less ram installed

act,data,slower,difference,fast,slow
in addition jemalloc tries to optimise for cache locality since the act of fetching data from ram is much slower than using data already in the cpu caches no different in concept to the difference between fast fetching from ram versus slow fetching from disk

system,access,thousands,slower,potential,benefits
once you re out of ram and the system starts swapping - disk access is thousands times slower than ram so any potential benefits of 64-bit code are flying out of window

orders,magnitude,slower,significant,difference
as disk i o is orders of magnitude slower than ram i o this can cause a very significant difference in query execution times

cpus,slurm,space,tricky,different
number of cores cpus in slurm disk space and ram are more tricky to get as it might be different on different nodes

program,virtual,memory,activity,concerned,best,bet,greater,available
also keep in mind that once ram is exhausted your program will start running in virtual memory on disk which will probably cause far more disk i o activity than the program itself so if you re concerned about disk i o your best bet is probably to make sure that the batch of data you re working on in memory doesn t get much greater than available ram

cache,data,throughput
a cache miss at the cpu cache will load more data from ram a cache miss in ram will load more data from disk all this translates into reduced throughput

use,plenty,queue,length
the cpu it s never over 20 of use we have plenty of ram and the disk never have more than 0.50 in the queue length

text,space,slower,error
the data type text requires more space in ram and on disk is slower to process and more error prone

data,rethinkdb,efficient
a larger cache reduces the number of reads but up to a certain limit also increases the amount of unsaved data that rethinkdb can accumulate in ram to make disk writes more efficient

important,random,access,accesses,slower
it is important to minimize the disk accesses - because disk are not random access and disk accesses are much slower then ram accesses

ssd,several,magnitude,slower,systems,unresponsive
since your disk even if it s an ssd is several orders of magnitude slower than ram the systems gets unresponsive

access,slower,file,longer,next,time,slow,memory,files,faster
access to disk is slower so when you ve written to a file it will be flushed to disk and no longer reside in ram which means that next time you need the file you might be going to get it from disk slow whereas in memory mapped files you know the file is in ram and you can have faster access to it then when it s on disk

ethernet,slower,transfer,gige,rpc,mpi
but if your shared file system is a raid 5 or 6 array exported to the nodes via nfs over gige ethernet that will be slower than ram to ram transfer via gige using rpc or mpi because you have to write and read the disk over gige anyway

objects,faster,read,slower,lesser,dependencies
pros of objects faster disk read is slower than ram lesser dependencies of the system s state

smaller,data,time
so even if your ram is much smaller than your disk you could assume you can read data that s already in ram 90 of the time or more

bottleneck,performance,slower,cpu,paging,slow
memory is a bottleneck to performance ram runs slower than the cpu and if you re paging to disk than it s really slow

data,map-reduce,though,sort,number,accesses,access,slower
however if this is indeed the case - and the data does not fit ram and you cannot use map-reduce i suspect sorting and iterating - though will be o nlogn will be more efficient using external sort - because the number of disk accesses will be minimized and disk access is much slower then ram access

yes,faster,virtual,memory,access,slow...,applications
i would say that probably yes as long as we have enough of ram which is faster that virtual memory in case we need to access something from the disk which is extremely slow... but also i know that some applications just require having paging

tech,fine
any db tech is fine with me as long it does not need lots of ram and uses less disk

computer,byte,values,hard,virtual,memory
your computer ram can hold more byte values before it starts having to use the hard disk as virtual memory

information,variable,faster,direct
saving information to a variable and therefore to ram is always faster than direct to disk

things,worse,smaller,os,es,complete,usage,system
to make things even worse in many cases your ram will be smaller than your os es complete disk usage forcing your system to use swap space ie

system,hard,space,mb,speed,slower
in other words the operating system is using some of your hard disk space to satisfy your 13 mb allocation request at great expense of speed since the hard disk is much much slower than ram

swap,space,size,better,hard,drive,hdd,access,slower,second
the diminishing returns means that if you need more swap space than twice your ram size you d better add more ram as hard disk drive hdd access is about 10â³ slower then ram access so something that would take 1 second suddenly takes more then 15 minutes

hours,hard,access,slower,caches
that s basically possible but it would take hours as hard disk access is so much slower than accessing ram caches

amount,time
if the amount of ram is less you ll have a lot of swapping to disk which is a lot more time consuming

alot,hard,slow,ssd,slower,subsequent,loads
the first load involves reading alot from the hard disk which is slow even ssd is slower than ram subsequent loads should be faster though 3 seconds on the ssd seem to be odd

data,bigger,performance,hits
note when the data is much bigger than ram performance degenerates into counting the disk hits .

possible,l3,synchronization,cpu,slower
all of rsfalcon7 s suggestions can be combined into a super rule do as much as possible in unshared resources l1 l2 caches - implying economizing on code and data requirements - and if you need to go to shared resources do as much as possible in l3 before going to ram before using synchronization the cpu cycles required to synchronize is variable but is slower - or much slower - than accessing ram before going to disk

set,larger,operating,system,pages,room
if your working set is larger than your ram the operating system will be constantly swapping pages out to disk to make room to swap in pages that an application wants to access

data,memory,faster,access,io,tempdb
on the other hand table variables usually with smaller data are kept in memory ram making them faster to access and therefore less disk io in terms of using the tempdb drive when using table variables with smaller data compared to temporary tables which always log in tempdb

insertion,pattern,smaller,index,high,destination
in this case the latter is likely to cause trouble because the insertion of a name hits a random node in the tree i.e the name insertion doesn t follow a pattern and your ram is smaller than the index chances are high that the destination must be fetched from disk

system,paging,access,expensive
i m sure there are other holes like that too - but the code above will work on any system which supports paging and where disk access is much more expensive than ram access

seek,nanoseconds,faster,best,thousands,slower
a disk seek takes about 10 000 000 nanoseconds of course some disk are faster but the best of them are still thousands of times slower than ram

ssd,slower,orders,magnitude,hash,table,big,money
the ssd is still slower than ram by orders of magnitude but it s quite reasonable to have a 50gb hash table on disk but not in ram unless you pay big money for big iron

worst,impossible,size
and at worst impossible at all ram size is usually much less than disk size

enough,data,set,atleast,index,coz,time,slower
make sure you have enough ram so that your data set fits with ram atleast your index should fit inside the ram coz each time a data fetched from disk is 10 times slower than ram

files,machine,help,os,random-access,io,real
first it creates 10 5gb files 50gb is way more than machine ram so not much help by os file-cache then starts a zookeeper client which is supposed to keep its connection with the zookeeper server up by sending pings heartbeats regularly then makes 10 threads doing random-access into the 10 files creating a lot of disk io but really no real usage of the cpu

lob-storage,time,query,execution,slower
if lob-storage isn t in ram at the time of a query execution then we need to read it from a disk which is of course much slower than from ram

name,recall,accesses,orders,magnitude,slower
there are libraries that allow on-disk data structures comes to mind and another one whose name i can t recall at the moment but disk accesses are orders of magnitude slower than ram

bigger
disk is bigger than ram

table,larger,single,io,access
if the table is larger than ram you will likely have a single disk io per access the intermediate index levels will be cached

rate,speeds,orders,magnitude,lower,speed,concerned
at any rate disk speeds are orders of magnitude lower than the ram speed and i wouldn t be too much concerned about the mode here unless of course it turns out that caching is different in the two modes

set,access,paging,quicker
there are tonnes of posts blogs on this so just google mongodb working set but as you know access from ram rather paging to disk is quicker

audio,files,faster,reading,hard
reading audio files from ram is much faster than reading audio files from hard disk

comments,likely,access,orders,magnitude,slower
as sven marnach wrote in the comments your problem is most likely i o bound since disk access is orders of magnitude slower than ram access

database,sqlite3_open,idea,bullshit,faster,mapping
so my question is how to move this database into ram where i can access it via sqlite3_open or if my idea is bullshit and leaving the database on disk is faster than moving it into ram via mapping

becuase,reading,faster,kind,os,program
but becuase reading from ram is usually faster than from other kind of memory storage divice os copy the program from disk on ram and start executing program from there

difference,speed,arithmetic
the difference between disk speed and ram speed is more or less an arithmetic factor

dataset,larger,massive,io,hundreds,thousands,operations
if your dataset is larger than your ram you ll be facing massive io delays on the scale of tens of milliseconds and upwards tens or hundreds of thousands of times because of all the required disk operations

resource,allocation,cores,available,risk
if for any node total resource allocation makes more than all ram cores disk available you are at risk most often at risk of spark task or yarn child being unable to start

files,order,magnitude,slower,virtual,memory
disk files are of course an order of magnitude slower than ram and thrashing your virtual memory system could actually be worse than that depending on your access patterns

cache,pixels,several,orders,magnitude,slower
however be aware of this to cache pixels to disk is several orders of magnitude slower than using ram

file,costs,time
is there any way to read and write in ram instead of file as disk read costs more time

multiprocessing,data,access,slower,calculations
using multiprocessing is probably not going to speed up reading data from disk since disk access is much slower than ram access or calculations

main,memory,faster,values,hard
accessing the main memory ram is much faster than reading values from the hard disk

faster,access,portion,main
it is the ram used for faster access to disk.it is embedded in the disk or it can be portion of main memory set aside

hard,slower,memory,virtual,private
because hard disk have a much slower memory than ram virtual private server performance may slow down considerably

bandwidth,higher,ssd,network,latency,lower
also ram bandwidth is much higher than disk or ssd or network bandwidth and the ram latency is much lower too

tables,better,free,wal
basically if your tables fit comfortably in ram you are better off reporting from them since you are keeping disk i o free for the wal segment commit of your event entry
