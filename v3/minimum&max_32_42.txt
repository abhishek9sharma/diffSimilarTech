number, greater, matches, ---------------------------------------------------

integer,number,matches,equal
the syntax is where min is zero or a positive integer number indicating the minimum number of matches and max is an integer equal to or greater than min indicating the maximum number of matches

likely,lower,first,value,higher,current
this way the first value read will most likely be lower than the minimum at the moment and the first value will also be higher than the current max value

maximum,shape,axis,integer,larger,ceil,smaller,floor
in general case you need to determine maximum and minimum shape coordinates along every axis and define minimum axis aligned integer bounding box with values rounded to larger using ceil for max and rounded to smaller using floor for min coordinates

integer,number,matches,equal
the syntax is where min is a positive integer number indicating the minimum number of matches and max is an integer equal to or greater than min indicating the maximum number of matches

decimal,range,greater
i want to validate a number as decimal up to two decimal and minimum range is greater than 0.00 and max range is up to 99.99

group,value,lower,index
for group 1 the minimum value is actually 2 however i need minimum indexed lower than max value index position

size,lower,kb
my question is can we set max stack size lower than the minimum stack size which may be 4 kb for the goroutines

number,greater,value,remainder,step
here i have an algorithm that adds a number to another number e.g current + step and if that number is greater than the max value the remainder of the step is added to the minimum

index,set,values,min,front
if you per se wanted the minimum index for a set of values with more than one minimum you d just swap out max for min at the front of the expression

requirement,smaller
the minimum requirement and smaller than the max requirement

week,number,int,value,greater,two-digit
the minimum week number is a single int value like 1 the max is never greater than two-digit int like 24 because there are 52 weeks in a year

number,array
now you are iterating exactly like your example with one change to know what is the next set you are moving to you have to replace every number in the current set with the next number in the array and replace the max option that less than the minimum you are saving

query,matches,lat
so i use the formula you have in your second query to first calculate the bounds -- the four lat long values at the extremes of the allowed radius then take those bounds and do a simple query to find the matches within them less than the max lat long more than the minimum lat long

number,greater,gap,unobtainable
this way if the next number n is greater than max + 1 then a gap would have been made and max + 1 is the minimum unobtainable number

test,taker,scores,greater,total
the test taker passes if all their max scores are greater than all the test minimum scores or the total max scores is greater than the basictest qmscore

equal,greater,value
all numbers will always be equal to or greater than the minimum value or equal to or less than the max value

value,smaller,greater,maximum,new,min
i would just iterate through the array keeping track of the total and check at each iteration if the value is smaller than the minimum or greater than the maximum and if so store those as the new min max

query,min,security,id,difference,value
first i run a query to find the min and max for each security id then find the difference between the min and max and finally find a value that is 10 more than the minimum like this

data,lower,x,higher
in this example i would want to flag the following records in my data 2 lower than the minimum for x and 4 higher than the max for y

value,higher,year,data
from here you also need to take into account if the user inputs a value higher than the max year of the data and also less than the minimum

value,larger
how can the max value be larger than the minimum

limits,picker,date,today,year
i want to set limits to the picker such that the max date is today s date and the minimum date is not more than one year ago

syntax,min,positive,integer,number,matches,equal
the syntax is min max where min is zero or a positive integer number indicating the minimum number of matches and max is an integer equal to or greater than min indicating the maximum number of matches

value,greater,update,left
4.if minimum value is greater than the current value in array than add difference of than in ans add the difference with current value update max from left

input,number,domain,value,scale,min
assuming width and height are both positive numbers the only way to get a negative output value from the scale is if you input a number that is less than the minimum domain value for the x scale or more than the maximum domain value on the y scale -- which implies that the max min functions aren t doing what you expect

syntax,min,positive,integer,number,matches,equal
the syntax is min max where min is a positive integer number indicating the minimum number of matches and max is an integer equal to or greater than min indicating the maximum number of matches

username, object, dates, ---------------------------------------------------

date,object,similar,special,condition,min,dates
a bit of an rtfm answer open the file in csv format see the csv library and then iterate line by line converting the field that is a date into a date object see the docs for converting a string to a date object and if it is less than minimum so far store it as minimum similar for max with a special condition on the first line that the date becomes both min and max dates

username,length,class,min,http,bad
for the above dto when i m trying to submit a json object with username length is less than the minimum length in the class length min 3 max 30 i got http 400 bad request

template, symbol, second, ---------------------------------------------------

symbol,template,min
- preceeding symbol template is expected to appear exactly minimum min times but not more than max times

second,min,sign
if u want the second minimum then just change the max to min and change the less than sign to grater than

value,cobble,min
see if the max se value at the minimum cobble is less than the min se at the maximum cobble value

min,repetitions
which means minimum of min repetitions but not more than max repetitions

others---------------------------------------------------

max-flow,min-cut,flow,network,greater,capacity,s-t
if it were possible to find such a cut then max-flow min-cut would not be true the max flow of the network would be greater than the minimum capacity of an s-t cut

textboxes,user,price
i m simply checking the values of two input textboxes and alerting the user if the max price is less than the minimum price but they re evaluating backwards

current,element,heap
look-up in the case of failure should be constant time if the current element is less than the minimum element of the heap containing the max m elements we can reject it outright

visible
i wrote this assuming that you might adjust the minimum to be more visible but you d keep the max at 1

adk,extra
still you must increase max also if your minimum is anything less than 15 the adk is now building an extra folder new stuff in truth the new version of the adt is annoying i am just starting and now you will see they have enforced the use of fragments

child,preferred,height,hard-coded,larger
take the max of the child s preferred height or a hard-coded minimum whichever is larger

plugin,dll,interface,top,level
the plugin dll itself also does not expose anything more than the minimum interface required by max for adding a few top level scripted classes

path,shorter,possible,length,current,point,column,distance
to make sure no path shorter than max can be found one has to monitor the minimum possible length of a path until the current point the minimum over a column in the distance table

time,first,2-4x,longer
why is the max time which happens on the first iteration of the loop 2-4x longer than the minimum time

little,datas,new
if i is rather little just iterate and keep i minimum datas insert every new data in a binary tree of the i most little datas if it is less than the max of these datas
