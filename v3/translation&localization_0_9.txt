firms,happier,quality,chinese,traditional,companies
you may find some localization firms are happier to start with a quality simplified chinese translation and adapt it to traditional but you may also find that many companies prefer to start with the english source

english,portuguese,easy,russian,site
i don t need more than 2 localization now english and portuguese but i might need more later so it should be easy to add a translation if my app gets used by an russian site it should be able to send welcome emails in russian and with the name of the site brand that uses my app so i supposse what i want to do is something like a whitelabel product

training,authors,folder,permissions,responsible,publications
consider training authors or adjusting localization and read folder permissions to only the authors responsible for translation for those publications

team,responsible,different,countries
i d have one project team responsible for localization which may well involve more than just translation - different countries have different legal requirements currencies payment providers etc. and one team for improving the code base

engmaterial,english,possible,better,.net
is the best solution to add a new column called engmaterial and add the english translation there or is it possible to solve this in a better way with localization in .net

data,ios
now i m not sure if i should store the strings in core data or use ios localization as the translation seem more like app data than true localization to me


this is where i learned that localization is a lot more than translation

plural,form,strings,part,file
the second example the plural form can be translation using more than two strings because part of localization file is how plural forms are arranges

easier,text,images
localization it s easier to translation text than images
