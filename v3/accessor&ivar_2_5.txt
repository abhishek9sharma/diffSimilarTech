runtime, situations, significant, ---------------------------------------------------

faster,situations,significant
technically accessing the ivar directly is faster than using accessor but there are very few situations in which it will make a significant performance difference and would probably be a case of premature optimization

faster,runtime
the accessor will be faster since you ll avoid all the slogging through the runtime to find the ivar in question

others---------------------------------------------------

locks,direct,faster,call
nonatomic properties don t use locks but direct ivar is faster because it skips the accessor call

direct,access,faster,temporary,array,message,new
there s not much to recommend one over the other except that the direct ivar access is slightly faster the properties version creates a temporary array and sends an accessor message to make the new condition create its copy of that array

properties,easier,memory
if an ivar is going to be changed frequently declaring a properties and always using the accessor will make it easier to avoid memory management errors
