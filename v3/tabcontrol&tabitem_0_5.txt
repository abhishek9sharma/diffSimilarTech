doesnt,different,views,panel
it s almost like the tabcontrol doesnt know to treat the different views as tabitem its behaving more like a stack panel stacking the views

error
edit i can only reproduce this error when i have a tabcontrol with more than one tabitem


hi there i have define more than one tabitem in my tabcontrol

smaller,bigger
for example if i click the smaller tabitem the tabcontrol becomes smaller and if i select the bigger one it becomes bigger

closable,tabs,later,xaml
i ran into the same visual issue with closable tabs and resolved it by extending both the tabcontrol to be used later in xaml and tabitem classes
