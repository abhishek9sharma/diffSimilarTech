fft,faster,fftw,bindings
i found that numpy s 2d fft was significantly faster than scipy s but fftw was faster than both using the pyfftw bindings

recent,better,job,closer,output
edit more recent scipy does a better job of not always padding to powers of 2 length so is closer in output to the pyfftw case
