simpler, features, better, ---------------------------------------------------

better,features
before i am using codeigniter but i found out that laravel is much better than codeigniter and it has a lot of features

simpler
like laravel i see has lot of classes while codeigniter has much less classes and looks simpler to read follow extend

better
if you ve been using laravel then you already know it is better than codeigniter

others---------------------------------------------------

hot,time-effective
i understand that laravel is what s hot right now but i ve never played with it and am not sure if learning laravel is more time-effective vs using codeigniter which i know pretty well but just doesn t excite me any more

new,good,faster
i am new to laravel it s good for coding but it is not much faster than codeigniter

cooler,lightweigh,free
edit 2 what i would suggest you do is either to try to learn laravel getting cooler or codeigniter lightweigh if you have some free time

web,site,older
unfortunately i m pretty sure you ll not find any packages or projects that migrates a joomla web site to laravel or maybe codeigniter which is much older than laravel

personal,benchmarks,faster,lazy,loading
in my personal benchmarks laravel is undeniably faster than codeigniter due to lazy loading
