full-service, traditional, servers, ---------------------------------------------------

full-service,traditional,service
in choosing heroku is more full-service whereas engineyard is a more traditional service giving you access to boxes but needing sysadmin skills

servers,service
engineyard are more like heroku in that they aren t just providing you with servers they are providing you with a service and set up stuff for you

others---------------------------------------------------

application-level,support,bit,better
engineyard does provide application-level support too which is a fair bit better than what heroku does

great,company,hand,little
engineyard also seems like a great company but i think they hold your hand a little less than heroku
