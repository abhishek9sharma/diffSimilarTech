superclass,user,drag,item,menu,able
i set the superclass as uicontrol instead of uibutton because i might want to change this to let the user drag the item to reveal a menu or something but i m pretty sure that uicontrol should be able to do everything uibutton can do and more

simple,subclass,customization,hassle,nsattributedstring
a solution i ve used is a simple subclass of uicontrol which allows more customization than subclassing uibutton and less hassle than nsattributedstring et al

label,image,cleaner,scratch,tiles
instead of working around the 1 label and image you get in a uibutton it s cleaner to start from scratch with a uicontrol and create your tiles

sounds,methods,sendaction,finer,control
sounds like you want to use some of the inherited uicontrol methods such as sendaction to forevent this offers even finer control than with uibutton
