type,system,holes,ocaml,coq
i ve heard people complaining about haskell s type system having holes and that agda and ocaml coq are better

prominent,style,haskell-y,feel
coq is probably the most prominent language of the style but agda has a more haskell-y feel as well as being written in haskell itself

popular,power,hackage,respect
another popular language that offers more power than haskell is agda - i don t know agda beyond knowing it is dependently typed on hackage and well respected by people i respect but those are good enough reasons to me
