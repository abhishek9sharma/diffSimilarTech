it s difficult to tell without seeing the simulink model but i suspect that in simulink you are using a variable-step solver which is able to take much smaller time steps than in your matlab file giving you more accurate results

purpose,model,version,launch,script,process,faster,environment
for that purpose i want to transform the simulink model into a c version and launch it from a matlab script so that the process would be much faster than opening simulink environment
