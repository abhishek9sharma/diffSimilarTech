data,slight
however if the data is well scattered causing timsort to behave more like mergesort then binning first will possibly make for a slight win

sort,methods,complex,algorithm,simple
timsort is used by python and java for their sort methods and is rather supernaturally fast but it s a more complex algorithm than mergesort which matters if you re working in something like c - so if you just need something that works pretty well and is simple go with mergesort

sorts,insertion,sort,kinds,data,advantageous
this means that while the two underlying sorts it uses mergesort and insertion sort are both worse than quicksort for many kinds of data timsort only uses them when it is advantageous to do so
