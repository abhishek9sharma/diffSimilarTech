all-in,able,things,direction,inheritance
all-in all the reason is that nsmutablestring is able to do more things than nsstring and can do anything nsstring can hence the direction of inheritance

note,efficient,new,time,letter
note also that using nsmutablestring is more efficient than creating a new nsstring each time a letter is added

general,oppertunity,subclass,functionality,implementation
nsstring is more general as it leaves you the oppertunity to create another subclass of it that could add the altering functionality without using the nsmutablestring s implementation why ever you would want that to do
