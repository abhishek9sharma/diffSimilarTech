models, flexibility, variable, ---------------------------------------------------

accessible,variable,base,class
if you need a globally accessible variable or properties that s more suited to a base class that your classes inherited from

models,base,class,flexibility
this allows me to keep all of my models from having to inherited from a base class that has a messages properties and gives me more flexibility

better, values, composition, ---------------------------------------------------

values,instance,better,nesting,related,operations
less is a css extension that enables reuse and encapsulation of values color values for instance improves inherited allows a better nesting of related properties and operations also

paddle,object,player,enemy,composition,better
since the paddle object has properties that are shared by both player and enemy composition is a better choice than inherited

access,setter,method,derived,class,purpose
you cannot do that on that way but you can access a properties s setter method from a derived class so you can use inherited for the purpose

model,better,composition,individual,related,base
potentially you are trying to model something in inherited that is better suited for composition or your base class should be taking in an object instead of individual related properties if the properties aren t related then perhaps your base class is doing too much single responsibility principle

class,singlelinetextfield,tostring,method,value,values,better
the textfield abstract class which singlelinetextfield inherited from defines a tostring method but also value and values properties which are much better suited to what you re trying to do

higher, prototype, tree, ---------------------------------------------------

essence,object,prototype,higher,precedence
in essence an object inherited all properties of its prototype but an object s own properties has higher precedence than those of its prototype

form,higher,tree,simpleformcontroller
i don t see any form properties in the code you posted so either the posted code has been modified or the properties is higher in the inherited tree simpleformcontroller

methods, execution, clear, ---------------------------------------------------

methods,execution
inherited can be more about invoking properties and methods in an execution context similar to how we use .call or .apply and doesn t need to beget a massive codebase full of modules extending other modules only to end up treating them like completely isolated and individual objects anyway

dedicated,methods,clear
using dedicated methods for getting and setting properties is also more clear in inherited

others---------------------------------------------------

enumerable,work
even if there are no inherited enumerable properties it is still more work to do than not

car,dependencyobject,events
if you were planning on doing this for more than one properties i d recommend making car inherited from dependencyobject or implementing it from inotifypropertychanged instead of creating events for each

counter1,instanceof,verbose,real,private,count
counter1 can be used with instanceof and inherited but is more verbose and doesn t have real private properties eg count properties is exposed

keynotfoundexception,class,message,meaningful
just inherited from the keynotfoundexception class and override the message properties to generate a more meaningful message and then use your own exception class with a proper constructor

multiple,easier,small,base,functionality,state
multiple inherited makes it easier to compose classes from small mixin base classes that implement functionality and have properties to remember state

extension,task,easier,ad
extension or task properties might be easier to isolate since they re not inherited but they re less ad hoc

fine,earlier
the inherited and overriding of properties properties calls worked fine earlier

situation,better,thing,category-specific,attributes,relation,things
if i m reading your situation right it sounds like you d be better served by avoiding inherited on thing and instead thing about category-specific attributes as properties of the relation between things and categories

serious,re-use,functions
i generally use interfaces are too enforce a common behavior that a group of classes share whereas subclassing is more appropriately used in cases where you can achieve serious code re-use through inherited functions properties

easier,things
this should handle all cases of setting the properties makes them easier to implement in your inherited classes and cleans things up

public,objects,access
i fully understand that the properties are more easily accessed as public and that normally inherited objects won t have access to them otherwise

containment,pattern,layer,inotifypropertychanged,data,model
for the vm layer i like the containment pattern more than inherited and at this layer i also implement inotifypropertychanged which is also a properties of the vm and not the data model

tag,pourpose,clear,semantic
you could also use the tag properties for this pourpose but i think that inherited will be more clear adding semantic meaning to your code

documentation
however i could not find it the documentation so it may inherited more than properties


not all properties are inherited read more here

desktop,controls,powerful,old,tag
now in .net for desktop controls you can use inherited which is much more powerful than the old tag properties anyway

is-a,relationship,model,methods
inherited is more of an is-a relationship for example a usermodel is-a model thus all properties and methods of a model will be part of a usermodel

opacity,children,text
use rgba instead on the container div to set the opacity as the opacity properties is inherited by all children elements even text nodes meaning a descendant of any kind can t have a higher opacity than its parent

line-height,.title,parent,check,higher,value
so i doubt the line-height properties is getting inherited to your .title from its parent so just check from where it is getting inherited and set the higher value for it
