slower, better, bcrypt, ---------------------------------------------------

better,bcrypt
pbkdf2 is arguably a better option than bcrypt scrypt having been much more thoroughly studied and tested

bcrypt,better
also since this is a bit old bcrypt is indeed better than pbkdf2 but scrypt is even better

bcrypt,slower
pbkdf2 bcrypt and scrypt are much slower

others---------------------------------------------------

bcrypt,weaker,orders,magnitude,stronger,kb,memory
bcrypt is weaker than scrypt although still three orders of magnitude stronger than pbkdf2 because it only requires 4 kb of memory

bcrypt,secure
alternatively scrypt bcrypt or pbkdf2 provide more secure algorithms

ubiquitous,nist,reasonable,arguments,stronger
i like pbkdf2 because it s so ubiquitous and recommended by nist even though there are very reasonable arguments that bcrypt and scrypt are stronger
