quicker, simpler, first, ---------------------------------------------------

legacy,function,quicker,first
you could also use nvl but that is a legacy function and coalesce is quicker since it stops at the first non-null

standard,function,simpler
the ansi standard function coalesce is simpler than using nvl and decode which should be obsoleted anyway

function,portable,ifnull
the coalesce function is used here because it is more portable than nvl or ifnull

others---------------------------------------------------

arguments,data,type,stricter,implicit,conversion
2 however coalesce requires all arguments to be of the same data type thus being stricter than nvl which will first attempt an implicit conversion

oracle,pickier
nvl versus coalesce oracle is much pickier about reserved words

efficient,second,argument,first,null,arguments,time
coalesce is more efficient than nvl as it only evaluates the second argument if the first is null whereas nvl evaluates both arguments every time

cross-compatible,isnull,mssql,oracle
coalesce is more cross-compatible than isnull or nvl it works on mssql oracle mysql derby et al.

thing,portable
coalesce does the same thing here as nvl but is more portable
