images on google-chrome are much larger using the exact size of the image itself while safari respects width 140 height 140 settings

width,button,web,inspector,6px,larger
total width of button in safari web inspector 6px larger than in google-chrome web inspector

wider, menu, selector, ---------------------------------------------------

background,menu,wider
in safari the background of my menu navigation drop-down menu s is much wider than in google-chrome firefox

specificity.bootstrap,specific,menu,selector
solved the problem came from css specificity.bootstrap s css was judged more specific by google-chrome regarding my menu s selector but not by firefox and safari

site,nice,wider,pixel
the html tables on my site look nice and the way i intend them to in safari firefox google-chrome but look far wider than the set pixel size in ie

ios, slower, faster, ---------------------------------------------------

slow,browser,faster
it is only slow with google-chrome browser safari is much faster

okay,ios,strict,android,fine
okay safari ios is more strict than google-chrome android when it comes to this all fine but it still needs to enable me to allow the connection through

browser,results
the browser does not matter though safari gets way more consistently working results than google-chrome

defaults,machine,development,tools,better
it defaults to safari on my machine but i d like it to use google-chrome as the development tools in google-chrome are better

better,luck,mac,ios
if you use the share button on the xcode documentation window to open the page in a web browser i had much better luck with safari than google-chrome 31 you can click on the mac ios developer library link in the top left corner of the webpage

etc.,faster
i think it s simply because google-chrome firefox safari etc. are faster browsers

system,development,mode,slower,details
because of how google-chrome s plugin system works development mode in google-chrome is much slower than in firefox or safari see here for more details

ipad,slower,pc
my ipad 1 safari js benchmarked 38 times slower than google-chrome on my pc

diff1,faster
conclusion diff1 is faster in firefox opera and safari diff2 is faster in ie and google-chrome

website,slower,results
if i try to do a google search for website loading slower in google-chrome than in safari i get a lot of results about how safari is slower than google-chrome

gpu,acceleration,webkit,slower,front
in fact given that google rejected pointer event on the ground of speed which ie solved by gpu acceleration it can be said that google-chrome and webkit in general - safari is even slower is lagging behind on this front and the only way to help is contributing code to chromium webkit

desktop,closer,ios
edit what particularly interrests me is if desktop safari is closer to ios safari than google-chrome is

stable,touch,great,ios,situations
since the fixed position in general is not all that stable on touch some more than others google-chrome works great it is still acting up in safari ios 8 in situations that used to work in ios 7 therefore i generally just use js to detect touch devices including windows mobile

faster,70x,known
this makes firefox 50x faster than google-chrome and 70x faster than safari is there any known reason for that

mobile,browser,performant,ios,similiar
why would the mobile google-chrome browser be so less performant than ios safari browser and very similiar hardware

slower,mobile,nitro,engine
the one used by google-chrome and is slower than mobile safari s nitro javascript engine

smaller, child, fonts, ---------------------------------------------------

makes,child,height,larger
safari makes child block s height larger than google-chrome

middle,smaller,sizes
safari 5.1.10 6534.59.10 middle handles a smaller viewport but in sort order with a smaller viewport computes new image sizes even smaller than google-chrome

fonts,size,smaller
safari will display fonts without a specified size significantly smaller than in google-chrome

harder, wrong, json, ---------------------------------------------------

wrong,json,harder
dus anyone knows if there is something wrong with my json or if google-chrome is harder to get than safari

headers,harder
headers copied from google-chrome only since safari is harder to copy paste from

problems, browsers, hover, ---------------------------------------------------

test,problems
please especially test on safari because it has some more problems than firefox and google-chrome

fine,hover,issues
it seems to work fine in google-chrome but in safari it causes some hover issues on links

problems,browsers
now i recognized that safari make more problems then the other browsers like google-chrome or firefox

browsers,nice
on all of the other browsers i ve tried safari opera ie google-chrome it looks much less nice because all of those browsers scroll half a screen at a time

version, older, current, ---------------------------------------------------

older,version
it also gets broken even more in ios google-chrome which is an older version of safari

recent,version
it worked perfectly with google-chrome but safari 5 and firefox implement a more recent version of the websocket protocol and cramp does not so i couldn t get it to work there

older,version,current
safari still uses the older version while google-chrome uses a more current one

earlier,version,webkit,current,pages,browsers
google-chrome also uses an earlier version of webkit than the current safari so pages should be checked in both browsers

ie6,version
according to w3counter ie6 is used by more people than opera safari and any version of google-chrome

older,safe,insertadjacenthtml
well unless you re targeting older than google-chrome 1.0 firefox 8.0 ie 4.0 opera 7.0 or safari 4.0 it s safe to use insertadjacenthtml

devices,browsers,ipad,browser,mobile
browsers devices desktop browsers ie8+ google-chrome firefox safari ipad s browser mobile safari mobile devices browsers android mobile safari

webkit,issue,newer,version
it s not even a webkit issue unless google-chrome s got a newer version than safari

better, numbers, text, ---------------------------------------------------

better
firefox google-chrome opera and safari all handle it better

text,ugly,thinner,better
basically the way google-chrome renders text looks ugly and i want it to look like or almost like firefox or safari which looks thinner and better

better,great
safari comes in at just under 41ms performing better than google-chrome but still not great

huge,numbers,better
i guess firefox and safari handle huge numbers of elements better than google-chrome

moves,better
i think safari renders the moves better than google-chrome

values, cells, ---------------------------------------------------

cells
this happens in firefox and also in google-chrome cells shrink less in google-chrome but not in safari

values
it appears that google-chrome can handle more values at the moment but safari can t

api, error, job, ---------------------------------------------------

api,site,error,faster,wtf
this seems to me like a bandwidth error or something like that originally i ve got the error when i played with the html 5 audio api and if i loaded the audio file 10-15 times sequentially then i ve got the error but now i ve discovered that i get the error without the audio api too just by reloading the site a lots of times also safari gives me the error much faster than google-chrome wtf

susceptible,issue,better,job,realtime,api
google-chrome also is susceptible to this same issue although it does a significantly better job than safari at getting the realtime api re-connected

others---------------------------------------------------

work,setting,iframed,page,larger,part,text
safari and opera work with the google-chrome setting but firefox and ie display the iframed page larger than google-chrome causing part of the text to be cut off

scroll,event,smooth,example
i tried to use jquery and the scroll event it s working on google-chrome but not on safari and is definitely less smooth than on the example

mine,testing,faster,dot,syntax,keen
as you can see here a friend of mine did some testing and it seems that google-chrome and ie work a lot faster with the dot syntax while firefox and safari are more keen on the key syntax

ios
ios google-chrome is more ios safari than google-chrome itself

dom,children,vs,sec,seconds,second
for example try hiding a dom of of 200+ children in google-chrome vs safari vs firefox you will notice google-chrome takes 20+ sec safari takes 5+ seconds firefox takes less than 1 second

thing,css,prefix,free,-webkit
one more thing google-chrome is css prefix free however safari may need -webkit prefix for some cutting edge features

website,www.suezre.com,figcaption,pictures,good,space
i had created the website www.suezre.com and when viewed in google-chrome or firefox figcaption on the pictures looks good but on safari it takes much more space

performance,issues,nested,lists
i m noticing huge performance issues in google-chrome firefox and safari when adding more nested lists programmatically too many reflows maybe

strict,earlier
safari also seems to be more strict than what google-chrome did earlier

smoother,clear,google
safari 5.1 still renders smoother than google-chrome but it is now clear that google has done much improvement

secure
safari is more secure than ie or google-chrome

market,invitation,flame
google-chrome has more of the market than safari not and invitation for flame wars just a personal opinion without any weight -

color,alpha,good,results,bad.
i found out that with any opacity not text color alpha less than 1.0 google-chrome gave me good results but safari was still bad.

usage,outdated,release,popular,penultimate,version,ios
for comparison 0.68 usage means this outdated google-chrome release is more popular than the current and previous versions of opera the penultimate version of safari on ios and ie 9 or 10

mobile,hover,events,android,version
how can i get mobile safari to handle hover events like the android version of google-chrome

open,sans,bolder,lighter,font,weight,web,fonts
safari renders open sans bolder than in google-chrome so you would need to apply a lighter font weight for safari open sans google web fonts rendering in google-chrome

controller,bar,movement,noticeable,big,blue
the safari controller bar is the quicktime bar which is smaller and dark so the movement is less noticeable than google-chrome which has a big blue progress bar

internet,explorer,strict,security
it seems that google-chrome internet explorer or safari are more strict than firefox on terms of security

several,pixels,higher,lower
in safari it is several pixels higher up than in firefox and google-chrome and significantly lower in opera

filters,animatemotion,ff5+,interactive,interfaces,better
i have had issues with dynamically created nodes that use filters and animatemotion has been a bugged in google-chrome for way too long... we use ff5+ as our interactive interfaces for this reason safari is getting better too

iphones,ipads,disguise...,portion
a lot of people use iphones ipads and safari is literally the only option even google-chrome is more like safari in disguise... so it s quite a portion of users who are suffering from this issue

worse
google-chrome is worse than safari

android,iphone,mobile,similar,desktop,screen,format
android google-chrome and iphone mobile safari are usually more similar to each other than desktop safari is to mobile safari the screen format will be similar the layout similar and you ll be able to try real touch events etc

browsers,values,reporting,order,numbers,platforms,long,run
i ve been trying to sum up values over a swipe and see how different browsers report values and they vary a lot with safari reporting order of magnitude bigger numbers on almost all platforms google-chrome reporting quite more like 3 times more than firefox firefox being balanced on the long run but quite different among platforms on small movements on ubuntu gnome nearly only +3 or -3 seems like it sums up smaller events and then send a big +3

points,data,smoother,dots
the points of data in firefox and safari are much smoother in google-chrome they don t go past the dots

mac,webpage,600mb,ram,work,laggy
on mac with safari webpage get more then 600mb ram which is not happening on google-chrome for example but work on canvas feel same laggy on both browsers

similar,permission,error,reproducible
this does not seem to occur in safari or ie and a similar permission error occurs sometimes in firefox but is reproducible more often than not in google-chrome

cloneelement,slower,jsperf,test,createelement
in safari 10.0.3 cloneelement is 31 slower for the jsperf test mentioned above in google-chrome createelement is 17 slower for me

sans,bolder,switch,thinner
its weird when i use source sans pro it looks bolder on google-chrome but when i switch to safari it looks thinner

funny,cache,page
safari is more funny than google-chrome i can easily make google-chrome cache my page but safari does not

coverage,market,half,huge,strong
in any case vorbis clearly has the most coverage google-chrome has more of the market than safari now opera is about half of safari and obviously firefox is huge and it doesn t really have the strong opposition that theora has

table,link,edge,compatible,babel
the compatibility table link shows google-chrome firefox edge and safari are more compatible than babel now

support,ie10+,flexie
the only thing is that flexbox is not supported by older browser support by ie10+ google-chrome 20+ safari 3.1+ firefox 2+ read more about support so i probably would need to add the flexie polyfill to support this on older browser

works,weirdish,blur,hover,smaller,ends
works in google-chrome firefox a bit weirdish blur effect on hover opera ends look smaller safari ends look smaller

brighter
in safari it renders significantly brighter than in firefox or google-chrome

string,useful,windows,iphone,shorter
alternatively you could seek out a user-agent parsing library which turns the string into something more useful such as google-chrome windows or safari iphone in which case you could reasonably use a shorter varchar value

likely,straightaway,family,resemblance
so if something works on safari it s more likely to work straightaway on google-chrome more than it is on firefox - but that s just a family resemblance at the end of the day you ll still have to test each as every webkit browser product and version still uses a different version of webkit

apple,cross,domain,files,strict,middle
apple s safari applies almost no cross domain restrictions to files opened locally but firefox is much more strict about what it permits with google-chrome somewhere in the middle

saw,ios,worse,per-record,records,time
what i saw was that ios and safari both got worse per-record write times the more records i tried to write while google-chrome kept pretty much the same per-record write time regardless of the number of records i tried to write

stringent,requirements,domain,scripting,share,base
i read somewhere that safari has more stringent requirements on cross domain scripting - it and google-chrome share the same code base

engines,main.js,main.v8.js,main.nitro.js,main.gecko.js
i also have .js files being redirected to javascript engines as well for main.js in google-chrome it tries main.v8.js in safari main.nitro.js in firefox main.gecko.js

pouchdb,stores,experience,performance-wise,old,slower
in google-chrome 43+ pouchdb stores blobs directly to indexeddb as-is so it s probably the best experience you re going to see performance-wise safari and old google-chrome are slower

complexity,page,som,jank,scroll,worse,better
i planned on using svgs for the entire site but with only 20-30 svg images of medium to high complexity used in the page and google-chrome already seems to be showing som jank and high paint times for scroll and firefox is even worse though safari seems to do a lot better
