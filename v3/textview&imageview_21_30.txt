drawable, compound, drawables, ---------------------------------------------------

linearlayout
a linearlayout which contains an imageview and a textview can be more

drawables,linearlayout,compound,drawable
but the android guide says use compound drawables - a linearlayout which contains an imageview and a textview can be more efficiently handled as a compound drawable

drawables,linearlayout,compound,drawable
use compound drawables - a linearlayout which contains an imageview and a textview can be more efficiently handled as a compound drawable

linearlayout,compound,drawable
a linearlayout which contains an imageview and a textview can be more efficiently handled as a compound drawable

drive, tel, taller, ---------------------------------------------------

smaller,width
however the imageview has a smaller width than the textview

constraints,spacing,xdp,higher
i tried constraints spacing each imageview with xdp it is ok if all textview are not higher than the imageview but if a textview is higher than a imageview it will overlap

higher
i try to align my imageview and my textview but the imageview is higher than my textview

spacing,smaller,wrong
i also tried to do spacing from imageview to textview but then if the textview is smaller than the imageview the spacing will be wrong again

bottom,top,subtitle,subtitletextview,taller
i have a button that is bottom constrained to the bottom of the imageview however should be top constrained to the bottom of the subtitle textview if subtitletextview is taller than imageview

alignment,margin,greater
for api 18 and earlier the margin is being applied after the alignment so if the margin in the imageview is greater than 0 you will get your textview moved

fixed,size,rectangle,line,smaller,height,multiline,larger
in the image the square represents a fixed size imageview the rectangle is a textview which can 1 line smaller height than imageview or multiline height is larger than imageview

linearlayout,weight,smaller,blank
i have tried to put my imageview in a linearlayout and put a weight on it but if my imageview is smaller i have a blank between the imageview and the textview

closer,left,margin,tel
the imageview should be closer to left margin and the textview with tel should be closer to image

bigger
if the textview might be bigger make sure to center the imageview as well

bigger,drive,parent
assuming the imageview is always bigger than the textview it ll drive the parent height

larger,view
i have a larger view with a textview and an imageview inside of it

larger,dimensions
this should work as long as the imageview is larger than the textview in all dimensions

bigger,top
i have an imageview that is bigger than a textview and i want to center the textview on top of the imageview both vertically and horizontally

middle,extra,left,smaller,40dip
i got the middle textview to fill up what s left and some extra - leaving the left imageview to be smaller than the 40dip i ve set it to be

lower
make textview lower than imageview

higher,order
textview have higher z order than imageview

others---------------------------------------------------

length
i want to have another textview underneath these two but i am having a problem when the textview length is less than the imageview

higher,aspect,ratio,width,possible,maximal,parent,height
in this case if textview is higher then imageview imageview aspect ratio should be intact with max width possible and if imageview i higher then textview again width should be maximal and parent should have height as imageview

priority
how could i make the imageview have more priority than textview

easier,show
but i don t know how to align the imageview and the textview to be easier to hide show just the imageview when needed

fields,filepathurl,second,text,playvideo,visibility,files
in your sample xml add two more fields one filepathurl textview second add one more textview with text playvideo and setvisibility to gone and set the visibility of files imageview to gone

layout_alignbottom,linktitle,shorter,height,title,favicon
double edit so what was happening is that your layout_alignbottom in the linktitle textview was shorter than the height of two lines of text therefore it was cropping the title to limit the height of the textview to that of the favicon imageview

states,different,layouts
all 3 states are much more than an imageview + textview so i went for 3 different layouts for every state and only 1 of them is visible at a time

views,well.assign,bigger,3times,imagevies,space
add layout_weight properties to sub views as well.assign 3 to imaveview and 1 for textview now imageview always will be bigger than textview 3times and textview can not invade imagevies s space

text,longer,cardview,length
when the textview text is longer than cardview length it shows against the imageview and i don t want that
