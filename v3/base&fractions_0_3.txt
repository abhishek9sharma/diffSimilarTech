exponents,difficult,nth-root,result
fractions exponents are considerably more difficult since it means essentially calculating an nth-root of the base where and multiplying the result by the result of the integer portion power calculation

memory,use,non-paged,version,extra,space,square,root
memory use is a fractions of that used by the non-paged version at just under 600 kilobytes for a hundred million and just over 600 kilobytes for one billion which slight increase is just the extra space required for the base primes less than the square root of the range list

integral,part,significant,digits,decimal,point
so while for the integral part you divide by base to move the more significant digits towards the decimal point for the fractions part you have to multiply by base to move the less significant digits towards the decimal
