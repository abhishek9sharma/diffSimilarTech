stable
wan is less stable than lan

client,traffic,capacity
even if all the traffic resides on the same network the client traffic will have been throttled by your wan capacity which is always less than your lan capacity

stable,network,issues
lan is more or less stable wan can be with network issues like

things,faster,time,xfer,reverse
i find that on a lan things are faster without compression compression takes more time than xfer and on a wan it s the reverse
