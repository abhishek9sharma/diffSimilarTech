slower, int, powers, ---------------------------------------------------

int,larger,powers,faster
as int exponent gets larger taking powers might be faster than multiplication

sqrt,small,integer,formula,faster,readable
if the exponent is 0.5 you should use sqrt and if the exponent is a small integer 2 3 4 expressing the formula with multiplication is faster but less readable

small,parameter,faster
however with really very small parameter 2 in your case exponent is faster than multiplication

naive,slower,increases
however naive multiplication will get slower and slower as the exponent increases

misunderstanding,faster
the misunderstanding is that incrementing the exponent is not faster than doing a multiplication

analogous,successive,faster
this is analogous to the way you can compute exponent using successive squaring much faster than by repeated multiplication

others---------------------------------------------------

note,operator,higher,precedence,division,mathematics
note that the exponent operator has a higher precedence than multiplication and division just like in mathematics

easier,decimal,significant,digits
multiplication is even easier as you dont have to line up the decimal points you just do the math on the significant digits and simply add the exponent

operations,execution,time,addition
so ideally i want to have approximate relative times of elementary operations execution like multiplication typically takes 5 times more time than addition exponent is about 100 multiplication

qth,mathematica,larger
in addition since all my coefficients are positive and i only want the x qth one is there a way to get mathematica to discard all exponent that are larger than that and not do all the multiplication with those

arithmetic,expensive,division,powers,dividion,addition,subtraction,range
it will be much slower i don t have benchmarks but i would guess at least an order of magnitude maybe more decimal will not benefit from any hardware acceleration and arithmetic on it will require relatively expensive multiplication division by powers of 10 which is far more expensive than multiplication and dividion by powers of 2 to match the exponent before addition subtraction and to bring the exponent back into range after multiplication division
