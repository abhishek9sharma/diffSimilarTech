faster, slower, math, ---------------------------------------------------

math,faster,function,major
integer math is often much faster than floating-point so such a function could be a major performance win

individual,division,instruction,longer
an individual floating-point division instruction will take longer than an integer one

slower,arithmetic
historically floating-point could be much slower than integer arithmetic

slower
historically floating-point could be much slower than integer

context,faster,slower
depending on context floating-point code may be as fast as or faster than integer code or it may be four times slower

time,unlikely,division,multiplication,faster
if all the values vary each time then it seems unlikely that the floating-point division to compute the 1.25 followed by floating-point multiplication is going to be any faster than the integer multiplication followed by integer division

arithmetic,simpler
but integer arithmetic arguably is inherently simpler than floating-point

division,faster,cpu
floating-point division is typically faster than integer division on the cpu

rule,thumb,2x,slower
as a rule of thumb floating-point is about 2x slower than integer on

division,coarser
you re performing integer division which is coarser than floating-point division

possible,pong,arithmetic,likely,faster,difference,unlikely
it s even possible that you could implement pong using only integer arithmetic which is likely to be faster than floating-point -- but the difference is unlikely to be critical

combinations,32b,faster,cpu,gpu
there are lots of cpu gpu combinations where a 32b integer multiply is faster than a 32b floating-point multiply on cpu and vice-versa on gpu

slower
floating-point may be somewhat slower than integer but it s generally

accuracy,fixed-point,arithmetic
if you need more than integer accuracy but want to avoid floating-point consider using fixed-point arithmetic instead

math,faster
generally integer math is faster than floating-point math

today,units,faster,unit
today s floating-point units are pretty fast and may actually divide faster than an integer unit

divide,faster,fewer,bits,cpu,unit
floating-point divide is faster than integer fewer bits to divide assuming your cpu has floating-point unit

arithmetic,faster,equivalent,likely,type
which uses all integer arithmetic is usually faster than its floating-point equivalent likely significantly faster in the case of a floating-point type equivalent to t-sql s decimal type

arithmetics,complicated
floating-point arithmetics is by far more complicated than integer arithmetics

space,math,slower
they take up more space and floating-point math is slower than integer math

advisable,unsigned,int,bits,encodings
note that it is usually advisable to use an unsigned integer rather than an int to access the bits of floating-point encodings because unsigned integers are less prone to certain issues such as sign issues with bit shifts

faster,fixed-point,arithmetic
but another added benefit of this approach is that it could make your program run faster since fixed-point integer arithmetic is much faster than floating-point arithmetic

math,theory,representation,bits
i was wondering about some of the math or theory of whether a signed integer or signed floating-point representation in n bits encodes more granularity between its min and max values or if the two encode the same granularity

largest, root, smallest, ---------------------------------------------------

conversion,number,value,trsq,root,largest,smaller,square
note that your program may report some numbers as prime if their largest prime factor is very close to their square root if the number is the square of a prime because the conversion of number to a floating-point value may round it down so trsq may end up being less than the square root even less than the largest integer that is smaller than the square root

largest,smallest,greater,lower,digit,limitation,variable
i know c++ have functions that return largest or smallest integer that is greater or lower than a like ceil or floor.is there a function that implement digit limitation of floating-point variable

larger, format, general, ---------------------------------------------------

general,real,larger,maximum,integers,representable
floating-point solves the more general problem of representing some real numbers that aren t integers and some real numbers that are larger than the maximum integer up to which all integers are representable here 16777216 all with a nearly uniform relative accuracy at least 1 2 precision

single,precision,format,23-bits,type,bits,larger,float
therefore ieee 754 single precision floating-point format has 23-bits fractions and int type has 32 bits so if the integer is larger than 2 24-1 the float type can t represent it exactly

format,n-bit,fractions,larger,n+1
a floating-point format with a n-bit fractions can t represent the integer which is larger than 2 n+1 -1 because it will lose the precision

types, matlab, nsdecimalnumber, ---------------------------------------------------

nsdecimalnumber,types,able,bigger,numbers,precision
nsdecimalnumber and the floating-point types may be able to store bigger numbers than the integer types though with decreasing precision

types,uint8,arithmetic,matlab,precision
because integer types like uint8 have saturated arithmetic in matlab plus floating-point types have more precision when doing certain operations

others---------------------------------------------------

unpredictable,precision,issues,little,exact
however due to unpredictable floating-point precision issues it is sometimes little less than exact integer and in this case it is rounded down too much

types,larger,range
floating-point types have a larger range than the integer types so

value,higher,rank,float
because the floating-point value is of a higher rank than an integer it will promote the integer to a float

difference,number,corresponding,equal
the difference between each floating-point number and its corresponding integer is less than 1 or equal to 1 if you really must

instructions,ports,counterparts,ops
on intel cpus before skylake packed-integer instructions can always run on more ports than their floating-point counterparts so prefer integer ops

operations,32-bit,64-bit
this feature allows the processor to execute several arithmetic operations simultaneously often four 32-bit integer operations or four 32-bit floating-point operations sometimes more operations with narrower integers sometimes fewer operations with 64-bit floating-point

values,easier
integer values are easier to deal with than floating-point

representation,memory,third,link,variables,ones
floating-point representation in memory can t add third link - because floating-point variables is much more strange than integer ones

value,thanks,part
since the floating-point value is slightly less than the integer you rounded to thanks to .nextdown the integer part is going to be one less than that integer

scipy.ndimage,domain,better,results,image,processing
i did this very successfully with scipy.ndimage in the floating-point domain way better results than integer image processing like this

cell,phones,slower,order,magnitude,better,hardware,available
on somewhat limited processors like those in high-end cell phones floating-point may be somewhat slower than integer but it s generally within an order of magnitude or better so long as there is hardware floating-point available

processors,vector,load,data,operation,time
there exist processors on which using an integer vector load movdqa to load data that is consumed by a floating-point operation requires more time than using a floating-point load to get data for a floating-point operation and vice-versa
