requests, wrapper, kinds, ---------------------------------------------------

new,package,wrapper,easier,kinds
the new package httr provides a wrapper around rcurl to make it easier to scrape all kinds of pages

package,nicer,http,requests
the httr package is a bit nicer than rcurl for making http requests in my opinion and it sets a user-agent string by default

others---------------------------------------------------

parallelization,better,alternative
besides parallelization i also read that httr might be a better alternative to rcurl
