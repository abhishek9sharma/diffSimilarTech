worse, better, performance, ---------------------------------------------------

worse,performance
i noticed calayer had worse performance than uiview

better,performance
is calayer better than uiview in terms of performance

others---------------------------------------------------

fancy,wrapper,uiresponder,events
a uiview is no more than a fancy wrapper for a calayer â bringing uiresponder events animation conveniences among many other things

delegate
this does not work because the uiview you are subclassing i assume it is a uiview already is the delegate of its own calayer it cannot be the delegate of more than one calayer at once

possible,functionality,layers,lower-level
this is possible because calayer s expose more drawing functionality than uiview s doâ layers are lower-level than views and designed explicitly for the purpose of highly-configurable drawing within the layout and like many things in cocoa are designed to be used flexibly as a parent class or as a delegator or as a bridge to other drawing systems or just on their own

smaller
i want to add a calayer inside an uiview and this calayer will be smaller than the uiview

view,larger,lighter,frame,myview
this is better than using a second view a bit larger as a calayer is lighter than a uiview and you don t have do modify the frame of myview which is good for instance if myview is a uiimageview

corresponding
in fact each uiview has even more than 1 corresponding calayer

documentation,lighter,hundreds
i am using calayer s because as suggested in documentation calayer s are lighter than uiview and i have hundreds of them

controller,multiple
does that mean the the view controller has multiple uiview or that the uiview has more than one calayer

wrapper
a uiview is no more than a wrapper for an underlying calayer
