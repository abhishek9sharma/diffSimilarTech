improvements,features,vanilla,suggestion,http
due to many improvements to couchdb and that cloudant has more features than vanilla couchdb my suggestion would be to use a c++ http library to communicate with cloudant

libraries,wiki
regarding cloudant it s more or less just couchdb so to connect you can use these libraries from the couchdb wiki

last,complicated,broken,quorum
proper handling of the last case is more complicated under cloudant and probably couchdb 2.0 due to its totally broken quorum handling but that s a different topic.
