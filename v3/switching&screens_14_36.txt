60px, taller, 90px, ---------------------------------------------------

landscape,mode,listview,taller
however when i switching to landscape mode the listview is taller than the screens

mobile,landscape,desktop,mode,media,query,width
but then i noticed after changing a mobile to landscape it would switching back to the desktop mode due to the width of the media query being less than the screens landscape width

height,smaller,virtual,home
content height is smaller than screens height is because of the virtual key back home switching app

height,greater,layout,type
if the sum of all the listview item s height is greater than the screens height you switching the layout type for one where you have a viewgroup relative layout with a listview without the footer on the top and a linearlayout at the bottom the desired footer

size,smaller,flex-direction,figure
when the screens size is smaller i have it switching flex-direction to column which works well except i cannot figure out how to make the 2nd row trending down start where the trending up stops where ever that may be

side,large,responsive,smaller,vertical,orientation
the panels must be side by side for a large screens but they must be responsive and as the screens gets smaller and switching to vertical orientation

landscape,portrait,width,larger
switching between landscape and portrait changes nothing the width is still larger than the screens

smaller,next,row
if the screens become smaller it switching to the next row but all the buttons are centered in the middel

display-properties,smaller,x
and then switching their display-properties when the screens is smaller than x px

smaller,liquid,media,query,width
but when the screens is smaller than 900px we switching from fixed to liquid via media query switching to a liquid width will allow our images to scale down our text to wrap and a whole bunch of other great things

60px,90px,smaller
i ve got a responsive ad unit on my page and for some reason it has a height of 60px while i really need it to be 90px and switching to 300x250 when screens gets smaller

swipe,right,images,larger,size,height
i am using view flipper to show bunch on images like a slider where i implemented the functionality of swipe left and right to switching images now some of my images are larger than the screens size in terms of height are getting hidden

drag,images,larger
i ve already built a view that can take a drawable can use focused pinch-zoom and drag can auto-scale images can switching images dynamically and takes images larger than the screens

others---------------------------------------------------

windows,lower,normal,resolution,panel
after switching to windows 10 i ve noticed that when selecting a lower than normal screens resolution the panel fit mode will default to maintain aspect ratio meaning black bars appear

better,virtual,coords,higher,math,change,gl,convent
we can do a bit better if the virtual screens coords are higher resolution than our pixels which means we already get a sub-pixel position for the mouse cursor but the math won t change because we have still to switching to the gl s convent where integer means border instead of integer means center

webpage,buttons,hover,toggle,width
how can i make my webpage switching buttons from on hover to on toggle when the width of the screens is less than 769px

workable,solution,big,banner,mobile,browsers,size,smaller
i m looking to see if anyone has a workable solution so i can basically switching between this big banner and a smaller format for mobile browsers where the screens size is smaller and doesn t break my responsive site

monitor,longer,wider,table
but if i switching to my 24 monitor there is no longer this problem since the screens is wider and therefore the table rows are wider too

site,user,desktop,view,homepage,smaller
however my mobile site has an option that allow user to switching to desktop view if there are not fond of the mobile site but how should i do that since the javascript in my homepage will block any screens that s smaller than 1024

certain,constellations,three-column,layout,size,complex
for certain constellations switching from a 4-column to a three-column layout when screens size decreases more complex measure may be needed

home,likely,process,memory,probable,several,applications
by pressing home screens then android might more likely kill your app process to reclaim its resources mostly memory - this is more probable if you switching to several other applications

events,next,faster
i understand you are trying to load more events that are currently shown on screens so that they are cached and prev next switching works faster

beginning,first,displayed.when,button,second,right,left.but,remember..second,portion,half
i can switching between these two screens easily.at the beginning first screens is fully displayed.when i click a button second screens will come from right and first screens goes to the left.but i want to keep the second screens and remember..second screens has less width a portion of the first screen.that means a half of the first screens disappear

framework,better,compatability,resolutions,densities
switching to 2.2 framework which has better compatability with screens resolutions and densities

imagens,dp,worse,results
- in my code sometimes i use px for imagens and sometimes dp but i ve tried switching all to dp in this screens and had even worse results

col-md,pixels
question is there a way i can switching these two col-md 6 s around when the screens is less that x pixels across

number,handlebars,statement,different
if you want to show more than 2 screens you might have to use a number and extend a handlebars function that can be use a switching statement to test for different values to show different content

application,layout,different,textviews,able,button,clicks
i am developing application which requires many more than 80 screens layouts each layout having different image views buttons textviews and so on and i have to be able to switching between them upon button clicks

point,nothing,longer,external,blank,sake,exercise
at this point there is nothing i can do since the switching is no longer there... the external screens is just a blank screens for the sake of the exercise

full,nav-bar,hamburger,menu,px,wide
switching from the full nav-bar to the hamburger menu when the screens is less than 1200 px wide

shapes,color,game,touch,shape,circles
how to make textures appears above each other as the shapes in color switching game when i touch screens there s one more shape is appear such as circles sticks and other shapes so how can i do that in libgdx

longer,navbar,lines,space
when the screens resizes the longer elements in my navbar switching to two lines to take up less space

better,word,activity,activities,android
a better word than screens is activity you switching between activities in android

bigger,couple,full,split
when the switching gets bigger than a couple of screens full split it into functions that handle each state using a state table to look up the function directly

element,layers,small,size,smaller,bootstrap,div,similar,user,use
i am using flex to centre and position my element on my layers but when switching to a small screens size the element just get smaller while in bootstrap when i use when the screens get smaller the div take the whole width i wanna do something similar when the user switching to a small screens size i didnt use bootstrap because its realy hard to centre 3 div of in the middle of the page

text,able,paging,effect,bigger
the point of such an architecture is because i have news with some text between which i want to be able to switching with paging effect but the news text can be bigger than the screens
