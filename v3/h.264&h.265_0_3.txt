vp9,better,compression,efficiency,cpu,time
h.265 and vp9 are both better codecs in terms of compression efficiency than h.264 but are far less widely supported and take more cpu time

edit,hevc,better,compression,size,support,widespread,stick
edit h.265 hevc is even better at compression 50 of h.264 size in some cases but support is not yet widespread so stick with h.264 for now

4-,comparison,hevc,avc,intra-prediction
4- for comparison purposes between h.265 hevc and h.264 avc intra-prediction the total sae of a reconstructed picture by hevc should be less than avc
