longer,larger,contributor
mockito has been around a lot longer than scalamock and is much more actively maintained because of it s much larger contributor base

natural,applications,fewer,test,mature
scalamock looks more natural when developing applications in scala however from what i read it seems to support fewer test scenarios compared to mockito and it s also less mature
