forgiving, html, errors, ---------------------------------------------------

page,stubborn
while in google-chrome usually another page refresh fix it firefox is more stubborn

forgiving,irregular,syntax
i m taking a quite educated guess here that firefox is more forgiving with the irregular syntax than google-chrome

html,page,forgiving
most likely your post value has one or more characters in it that are breaking the html of the page and ie firefox are being a bit more forgiving than google-chrome is

work,forgiving,errors
actually your code doesn t work on firefox because he is less forgiving than google-chrome about errors

tolerant
is this expected and google-chrome is behaving correctly or is firefox just being more tolerant

forgiving,compliant
google-chrome is more forgiving or you could call it less compliant firefox less so

standards-compliant
firefox which is more standards-compliant than google-chrome doesn t allow this

detailed,information,ajax,errors
google-chrome provides more detailed information about the ajax errors even when firefox doesn t say anything

css,updates,html
some css updates may also be needed but this may help firefox behave more like google-chrome for your html

forgiving
i guess google-chrome is a bit more forgiving than firefox

forgiving,mistakes
google-chrome is just more forgiving for some mistakes then firefox

finnicky
in general i have found google-chrome to be more finnicky than firefox

lenient
in my experience firefox is sometimes more lenient than google-chrome but i would definitely test in both

faster, slower, version, ---------------------------------------------------

points,page,slower,point
there seems to be a couple of points scrolling down the page where it gets stuck in google-chrome also tested firefox it seemed slightly slower at that point but not broken with the scroll wheel or up down arrows only moving a couple of pixels at a time

ie8,faster
in ie8 and google-chrome it runs even faster than firefox in general and this slow down never happens

spidermonkey,slower,max,speed
spidermonkey firefox is slower 50 of google-chrome max speed but the speed is consistent

function,older,version
i would like this function to work in firefox ie google-chrome etc but at the moment it only works in google-chrome and older than firefox version 49

slower,usable
i ve tested the sample on firefox and it s a bit slower than google-chrome but usable

slower,devmode,plugin
the reason google-chrome is slower than firefox is that the devmode plugin runs in a sandbox so calls and data have to cross the sandbox boundaries

older,versions,picky,content-type
it appears firefox and older versions of google-chrome are far less picky with content-type headers on file downloads for apk s

faster,drawimage
rendering without buffering on google-chrome is faster than firefox so i m actually not sure why google-chrome is having such a problem with drawimage

slower,sunspider,tests
as you can see ie 8 is about 5 times slower than firefox 3.6 and almost 20 times slower than google-chrome 9 at least when using sunspider tests

renatoargh,test,faster
for example using renatoargh s test google-chrome is faster with option 2 firefox with option 1

anyone,slower,3d,rendering
and also does anyone know why is firefox so much slower than google-chrome in 3d rendering

developer,mode,details
i usually use google-chrome s developer mode which imho already gives even more details than firefox

use,development,faster,icons
i use google-chrome for development as i find it runs faster than firefox and ie so it is a bore to guess where the icons are

v8,faster,spidermonkey,things
as google-chrome s v8 is dramatically faster than firefox s spidermonkey at the moment these things are constantly in flux pick the forward loop as it s faster on the slower engine

file,cause,able,files
so is there an issue with the map file i am thinking no cause firefox is able to read ok why is google-chrome referencing the less files

slower,practical
as for firefox being slower at rendering than google-chrome i can assure you that for most practical purposes it s not

performance,test,filling,faster,clearing
here is a simple performance test showing that in google-chrome filling is faster than clearing i am not sure what goes on with google-chrome and canvas nowadays but in firefox clearing is many times faster than filling both significantly faster than google-chrome

slow,seconds,faster
in firefox it runs extremely slow 3-4 seconds in google-chrome it runs much faster

faster,sunspider,tests,loads,correct
right now google-chrome is faster than firefox sunspider tests so your statement it loads faster in firefox is not really correct

function,slower,machine
also google-chrome s map function is up to 2x slower than firefox on my machine

load,slower
in ie java-script load slower than firefox safari and google-chrome

demo,faster,slower
when i try the demo in google-chrome or safari it is indeed much faster but when i ve tested it in firefox it s consistently slower

test,combos,quicker
the most interesting thing i noted is that certain test combos in firefox are much quicker than even google-chrome

dom,api,1000-fold,slower,worse,areas,instance,test,innerhtml,faster
google-chrome is lightning fast when you use the dom api but vastly slower using the .innerhtml operator by a magnitude 1000-fold slower however firefox is worse than google-chrome in some areas for instance the append test is much slower than google-chrome but the innerhtml test runs much faster than google-chrome

use,dev,mode,slower
use firefox rather than google-chrome - google-chrome with dev mode is much slower than firefox

system,development,mode,slower,details
because of how google-chrome s plugin system works development mode in google-chrome is much slower than in firefox or safari see here for more details

difference,negligible,quicker,indexof
a very quick test suggests that the difference is probably negligible in google-chrome but that firefox is substantially quicker with indexof for short strings at least

diff1,faster
conclusion diff1 is faster in firefox opera and safari diff2 is faster in ie and google-chrome

faster,bit-wise
google-chrome is just faster than firefox which just faster than ie at bit-wise operations

idea,loads,function,slower
do you have any idea why google-chrome loads javascript function much slower than firefox

faster,wait,expected
maybe google-chrome is working faster than firefox try adding a wait with expected conditions

test,results,explanation,webkit,better
after inspecting the test in ie 8 9 and seeing its results look like those of firefox i think there s an explanation for the google-chrome results i m pretty sure google-chrome webkit has a better optimization in the first version of the test especially the parseint part which gives a better result for parseint there

latest,stable,fast,faster
the latest stable firefox 3.6 is fast but for example google-chrome is even faster

worker,version,benchmark,slower
compared to a non worker version in google-chrome my benchmark is somewhat slower in firefox it is much slower

gsap,performance,worse,repeats,css,animations
firefox gsap performance is still much worse than in google-chrome but google-chrome gsap does still lag every few repeats or so while in google-chrome the css animations do not

tldr,filter,faster,opposite
tldr in firefox filter is slightly faster in google-chrome that s the opposite

slowdown,worker,thread,slower,main
update just tried it on firefox 30 and it did not experience the same slowdown in a worker thread but it was slower than google-chrome when run in the main thread

load,faster
based on what you have provided i cannot tell if google-chrome actually does load faster than firefox

good,slower
firefox - good a bit slower than google-chrome

.prototype,faster,difference,slower
in google-chrome it seems .prototype is faster firefox shows no difference between the two although generally performs slower than google-chrome

results,browser,faster,webkit
the results varied from a browser to another firefox 4.0b12 is faster using but google-chrome webkit and opera is faster when using

top,faster
sometimes firefox might come out on top whereas other times google-chrome might be faster still

browser,implementation,faster,brackets,dots
it s just a matter of preferences and browser implementation eg firefox works faster with brackets while google-chrome works faster with the dots

test,program,5x,faster
different js engines are good at different things so depending on the test program you could have google-chrome being 5x faster than firefox say or vice versa

worse,load,time
my guess is google-chrome is caching more agressively and thats why you are seeing worse load time on firefox

thats,mean,faster,execution
however if thats the case does this mean firefox is faster in execution than google-chrome

browser,slower
it depends on the browser its definitely true for ie and firefox but seems slower on google-chrome

benchmark,extensions,higher,performance
so i wonder the benchmark is also influenced by the installed extensions or google-chrome is really so much higher than firefox in performance

class,great,worse
at one point i even had a small scale on the .pan class that looked great in google-chrome but was even worse on firefox

browser,webkit,devs,knowledgeable
usually you want to avoid solutions from browser-vendor as they ll cater toward that specific browser but opera webkit google-chrome safari firefox devs are usually more knowledgeable in terms of cross-browser solutions and compliance with the standards than m ones

slower,boats,highest
firefox is slower than google-chrome which boats one of the highest javascript engines a modified version of webkit

hardware,faster
also firefox 4 has hardware accelerated canvas that is marginally faster than ie9 and a lot faster than google-chrome

results,reproducible,faster,timeouts,dom
and of course the results - if they are reproducible - might suggest that google-chrome is faster than firefox or that firefox just prioritises timeouts over dom events

similar,older,issue,url,scrolling,execution
i have encounter a problem with google-chrome that is similar to an older issue with firefox at this url scrolling blocks javascript execution in firefox

slower,respectful,privacy
using firefox even it s slower than google-chrome it s still more respectful of privacy

mac,os,game,faster,smoother
i m on a mac os x 10.8.2 running firefox 18.0.2 - it actually runs the game faster and smoother than my google-chrome 25.0.1364.99

ie10,newer,hybi
firefox ie10 and google-chrome use the newer hybi variant

faster,bool
on google-chrome it s significantly faster to do this using 1 0 but on firefox it s slightly faster to do this using bool

older,safe,insertadjacenthtml
well unless you re targeting older than google-chrome 1.0 firefox 8.0 ie 4.0 opera 7.0 or safari 4.0 it s safe to use insertadjacenthtml

points,data,smoother,dots
the points of data in firefox and safari are much smoother in google-chrome they don t go past the dots

older,version,chromedriver
if you need to test with firefox then use an older version or google-chrome with the chromedriver

slower
firefox is even slower that google-chrome

mac,faster,pc,newer
google-chrome or safari on a mac could be much faster than firefox on a pc especially with newer apis

dhtml,kitchen,document.write,faster
in fact i ran some tests at dhtml kitchen and found that in firefox opera and google-chrome document.write was actually faster on the first load and comparable in speed of standard html on subsequent refreshes

color,btw.,faster
now when clicking a time less than 1 millisecond will be displayed however it obviously takes nearly a second on my computer until the changed color actually is displayed where btw. google-chrome seems to be faster than firefox

typeof,slower,fastest
in google-chrome typeof is slower than the other two but in firefox it is the fastest

faster
that means firefox is more than 7x faster than google-chrome here

doesnt,worse
so far this works how i wanted on google-chrome but it doesnt look the same when on firefox and looks even worse on ie 10

browser,wrapping,worse,extra,space
though from a design perspective it may be easier to simply add the extra 5px to the width designing for the worst case browser to prevent wrapping in google-chrome which is worse than extra space in firefox ie

condition,version
i need to do the same condition but for less than google-chrome version 46 and for less than firefox version 44

parsers,performance,v37,slower,v30
i have been working with linear parsers lately and noticed the performance in google-chrome v37 was much slower than in firefox v30

slower
firefox is slower than google-chrome in javascript

slower,laptop
why is firefox so much slower than google-chrome on my laptop

investigation,issue,newer,version,linux
after some investigation it seems this issue doesn t happen in google-chrome is related to newer firefox version 9.0.1 linux

hardware,power,faster,edge,latest,verion
what we can see is that regardless of raw hardware power google-chrome seems to run up to three times faster than edge and also significantly faster than firefox all updated to the latest verion

approach,slower
the problem with this approach is it works mostly in google-chrome but not in firefox which is slower

particular,page,faster
the trouble is choosing a good value for x since for this particular page google-chrome is so very much faster than firefox which is faster than ie

recent,version
it worked perfectly with google-chrome but safari 5 and firefox implement a more recent version of the websocket protocol and cramp does not so i couldn t get it to work there

faster,imacros
i ve found that firefox is greatly faster with imacros than google-chrome

slow,path,array.filter,slower,run
google-chrome is extremely slow for your code path but grep seems to be 50 faster than array.filter here making it 900 slower than the firefox run

2x,faster,array
oddly enough new array size is almost 2x faster than in google-chrome and about the same in firefox and ie measured by creating and filling an array

couple,screenshots,faster,capturevisibletab
i did a couple of screenshots and firefox canvas was faster than google-chrome capturevisibletab

faster,huge,files
in my experience google-chrome will be a lot faster than firefox to debug huge js files

faster
google-chrome being probably faster than ie or firefox seems to handle this differently

version,faster
but i guess google-chrome i have version 10 should be much faster than firefox 3.6

svg,performance,slower,webkit,ie10
svg performance in firefox is slower than in webkit google-chrome and ie10

abc_def,property,faster
the funny thing is that for abc_def property google-chrome is actually much faster than firefox and ie as i expected

easeljs,worse
and found out that framerate of createjs easeljs is much worse in firefox than in google-chrome ie

faster,70x
this makes firefox 50x faster than google-chrome and 70x faster than safari is there any known reason for that

win7,worse
i was testing on google-chrome win7 but with firefox it seems worse

browser,behavior,stricter
it is also proper browser behavior firefox is just stricter about it than google-chrome is

faster,webdriver,dom
as you said google-chrome is faster than firefox so the webdriver is trying to interact with the dom before when elements are not yet visible exist

faster,browser,spread,results,accurate,result
i am not concerned about the fact that firefox runs faster as browser js implementations will vary so much as the wide spread of results encountered in google-chrome that makes getting an accurate result impossible

better, firebug, tools, ---------------------------------------------------

late,better,performance
of late firefox has had much better performance than google-chrome

better,reality,good
we wish google-chrome was better but the reality is that it s still not as good as firefox

better,settimeout,final
firefox works a bit better than google-chrome but the settimeout just seems to delay the final result being shown rather than delaying each step

computer,better,tests,jsperf
on my computer firefox performs much better than google-chrome on these tests using jsperf

better,browser,developers,cause,tools
although firefox is a better browser for developers than google-chrome cause it gives you more tools to work with

hand,edges,lines,directions,firebug,dev,tools
you can see if you look at the bottom and right hand edges of both google-chrome lines up perfectly but firefox seems further in both directions and i cannot work out why either in firebug or google-chrome dev tools

better,accuracy,lower,time
phantomjs achieves a better accuracy than firefox slightly lower than google-chrome but in around half the time of firefox

formatting,better
it seems google-chrome applies some formatting to render better than firefox

dev,tools,better
google-chrome dev tools are by far better than firefox ie whatever imho

better
also ie and firefox seems to work better than google-chrome

new,tiles,maps.google.com,issue,better
in firefox the render of new tiles and the panning is laggy this is not the case when using maps.google.com so it s not an issue of google-chrome being better than firefox

better,crash,issue
i have tried firefox and it better than google-chrome crash issue is not always happen but not solved this issue

logs,browser,laugh,better,google,apps
the logs only seem to work with a google-chrome browser which is a laugh as usually firefox is better at running google apps than google-chrome

debugger
what s up with google-chrome that the debugger behaves less conveniently than firefox

better,use,slower,image,comparison
better use google-chrome even thought firefox is not slower than google-chrome for once probably the tracing for the image comparison pays off yay

bigger,time,difference,gap,animation
google-chrome has a bigger time difference yet firefox is the one with the gap in the animation

support,ie10+,flexie
the only thing is that flexbox is not supported by older browser support by ie10+ google-chrome 20+ safari 3.1+ firefox 2+ read more about support so i probably would need to add the flexie polyfill to support this on older browser

better,compatibility,intermittingly,background
after fixing css background-image style formatting to get better compatibility with firefox and ie i found that google-chrome intermittingly loses the background images when you scroll up and down on the page

great,worse
it works great in google-chrome and safari haven t tested ie but i m sure it s somehow worse than firefox

use,better
instead of firefox or ie i use google-chrome and i superficially feel google-chrome is responding better

computer,statistics,better,normal-fast,best,slow
bad buffering can also be a result of a slow computer because statistics show that google-chrome is better for a normal-fast computer and firefox works best on slow computers

time,plugin,better
it s not the first time that the plugin for firefox works better for me than the one for google-chrome

better
and it would look better with the firefox s google-chrome hidden

better,performance
in my experience google-chrome has better javascript performance than firefox

default,directory,situation,better
i used firefox as it can be configured to download to a default directory but i don t think the google-chrome situation is any better

explorer,better
here is a screenshot of how it is displayed on internet explorer better than firefox but not centered like in google-chrome

css,go,better
whether you use a plugin or write your own code css only is a no go for google-chrome safari and as you said firefox is better at dealing with it

tool,present,firebug,used,powerful
a similar tool is now present in firefox you had to use firebug before but google-chrome is more used partly because of its more powerful js engine v8

standards,compliant,good,picky
i have already run into problems with old javascript code which i thought was standards compliant by firefox or opera standards - which are pretty good but google-chrome was even more picky

ps,situation,better,new,line
ps i ve noticed that in google-chrome situation is better than in firefox but new line still starts beneath tag

algorithm,better,text
and additionally the algorithm that google-chrome uses is better than the one in firefox at least for handling the resizing of text

performance
the performance in google-chrome is best less so in firefox and ie

font,sharp,ie8,good,fuzzy
font looks sharp in google-chrome safari ie8 not as good as other 2 but less fuzzy than firefox

time,add-on,api,restrictive
no and there won t be any time soon because google-chrome s add-on api is more restrictive than firefox

alternative,ajax,add-on,easier,web,browser
another alternative for javascript ajax is writing a google-chrome add-on easier than firefox or embeding a web browser within your application

sensitive,better,response
especially sensitive in google-chrome as firefox had a better response time---

better,support
is it because google-chrome has much better javascript support than firefox

apis,experimental,likely,better
the google-chrome apis are currently experimental hence these tools are likely to be better developed under firefox

test,timer,better,hope
when i ran the test individually with a timer google-chrome actually performed better than firefox hope this helps

browser,behavior,addon,api,easier,interface
in my personal experience it is impossible to modify the browser behavior in google-chrome if the addon api does not allow for it - in firefox this is much easier to change as much of the interface logic is written in javascript and there are api s for just about anything

picky,characters,uris
firefox is more picky about characters that are set in uris than google-chrome

debugger,firebug,better
evidently firefox debugger firebug is better than google-chrome debugger

text,ugly,thinner,better
basically the way google-chrome renders text looks ugly and i want it to look like or almost like firefox or safari which looks thinner and better

better
firefox handles this better than google-chrome does but neither exactly the way i want

huge,numbers,better
i guess firefox and safari handle huge numbers of elements better than google-chrome

better,firebug
google-chrome shows it better than firefox firebug

nicer,box
used to be firefox but google-chrome is nicer out of the box

browser,usage,android,line,pasting,better
if you are able to enforce browser usage i find that google-chrome on android preserves line breaks when copying and pasting much better than firefox

better,benchmark
also why does firefox perform way better than google-chrome on this benchmark

better
my firefox adds more chopping to video playing itself google-chrome plays the video much better

little,nicer,element
in firefox this might be handled a little nicer than google-chrome but rather than completely redraw an element you should try to append only what you need

experience,better
until people have more experience with google-chrome i would think firefox is a better choice

html,collection,better,imo
google-chrome sends back and html collection that is longer really better imo than firefox ie or chromium

firebug,version,better
install firebug firefox version is better then a google-chrome one

emulation,point,devtools,feature,rich,firebug
however mobile device emulation is one of the point where the google-chrome devtools are more feature rich than firefox firebug

bug,lucky
is it a bug in google-chrome or am i more or less lucky to get this chaining to work in firefox

device,dependent,objects,better,arrays
performance is browser and device dependent for example firefox handles objects better than arrays while google-chrome prefers arrays

bug,better,job
have i discovered a bug in firefox or is google-chrome just doing a better job of clearing up my shonky javascipt

better
also it does appear that firefox consistently handles this better than ie or google-chrome

better
google-chrome handles these better than compared to firefox

better,firebug,developer,tools,network,tab
you can do this by looking into the source code or better with firebug firefox or developer tools ie google-chrome in the network tab

version,available,firebug,lite,better
there is a firebug version available for google-chrome firebug lite but the firefox version is much better and i d highly recommend you at least try it out

better,regard
so firefox is better than google-chrome - but both suck in that regard

ie8,better,browser,possible
ie8 is the same and firefox is much better but i ve migrated away to google-chrome now so would like to stick with the one browser if possible

tools,results,inspector,firebug
also consider doing a web search for responsive bookmarklet tools for results that can help a-bit more than google-chrome s inspector or firefox s firebug

nexus,better,display,sluggish
firefox on nexus 7 is a bit better at producing reasonable sample rate readings but the updating of the display is even more sluggish than google-chrome

knowledge,better,apologies
my knowledge of firefox is better than google-chrome so my apologies if i missed something

sporadic,time,lesser,extent
this is sporadic and i see it happening most of the time with firefox 4.0.1 and 5.0 and to a lesser extent with google-chrome

iframes,better,span,font
they use iframes in firefox which seems better but in google-chrome they do this by putting manually defined span and font tags

pd,note,developer,tools,better,complete
pd note that firefox s developer tools are better and more complete than google-chrome developer tools but in essence are for the same purpose

animations,chromium,better,general,browsing
also for animations google-chrome chromium behaves much better that is why i use it for development but do my general browsing in firefox

transparency,issue,better
transparency is also an issue however google-chrome seems to handle all three better than firefox

easier,better,element,webpage
firefox is easier and better than google-chrome in finding the element from the webpage

better,black
in firefox it s much better than google-chrome but still not as black as ie

extensions, easier, extension, ---------------------------------------------------

easier,days
firefox is probably easier than google-chrome these days

tools,browsers,#main_nav_bar,ul,wider
after looking into the issue with the inspection tools of both browsers it seems that firefox is making the #main_nav_bar ul 10px wider than google-chrome

access,internals,possible,widgets,extensions
firefox just provides far more access to its own internals and system to the extensions so its technically possible to do more with them than with opera widgets or google-chrome extensions

resources,threads,possible,work
also about firefox i know still less than google-chrome and i m not sure about how it innerly manage resources among threads and if it is even possible to achieve what i want but if possible i d need to do the same work with firefox threads

cross-browser,extensions,particular,easier
the namespace is supported specifically to make cross-browser extensions with google-chrome in particular porting from google-chrome to firefox easier

extensions,easier
google-chrome extensions are much easier to learn and create than firefox

extensions,power,wider,access
firefox extensions have much more power than google-chrome and have wider access to browser s internal api

advanced,plugin,extension,work
firefox has a more advanced plugin than the google-chrome extension but both work

programming,extensions,easier,similar
i found programming google-chrome extensions easier than firefox but i couldn t come across something similar to xpcom in google-chrome

extension,alittle,harder
i know js and i ve maked extension for google-chrome before but i think making for firefox is alittle harder

easy,apk,command,easier
with firefox it was very easy i just grabbed the apk from their ftp server run the adb install command one would think it should be even easier with google-chrome but it s really not

webextensions,easier,instead.
i have been trying to do this in firefox webextensions but if it s easier with google-chrome i will try it that way instead.

extensions,limited,hook
google-chrome extensions are considerably more limited than firefox extensions â â they can only hook the behavior of the browser in certain predefined ways

heads,firebug+firepath,handy,tool,developer
first just a heads up you may want to try firebug+firepath on firefox which is a more handy tool than google-chrome s developer tool

stable,versions,permissions,older,work
on stable versions of google-chrome the permissions show allow and it still won t connect even with firefox works older versions of google-chrome work

types,extensions,capable,webextensions
other types of firefox extensions are significantly more capable than webextensions google-chrome extensions

great,tool,useful,quicker,extensions
also google-chrome has a great tool that allows you to edit css on the fly which i find more useful and quicker than using firefox s extensions

extension,reliable,addict
2 install the firefox extension there s also one for google-chrome but the firefox one is more reliable -- so if you re a google-chrome addict like i am then use both

easier,firefoxes,tools
i found that google-chrome was easier to get working than firefox but firefoxes tools such as firebug were quite nice to work with

smaller, bigger, text, ---------------------------------------------------

word,look,wider
the same word in firefox look wider than in google-chrome

width,document,smaller,example,screen,resolution,reports
while the rest of the browsers report the correct width of the document firefox reports a smaller one example at screen resolution of 1920x1080 ie google-chrome and safari reports 1920 while firefox reports 1903

issue,height
the issue that i encountered was that google-chrome was giving me height about 300px more than the firefox ie

styling,font,color
i tried here but google-chrome doesn t show any styling except font color while firefox shows some more

position,higher,matter,padding
the position of the list in firefox is always higher than that of google-chrome no matter how i padding or margin the list

shape,button,2px,taller,right
by highlighting the shape of the two elements you can see that in firefox left the button is 2px taller than in google-chrome right

higher,baseline
ie firefox higher than baseline google-chrome on baseline

inputs,attribute,wider
even if you give the inputs a attribute firefox renders them wider than google-chrome

input,field,bigger,text
here my problem is date input field in aligning correctly in firefox but in google-chrome it is displaying bigger than all other text boxes

viewport,wider,range
regarding the viewport resizing firefox goes 10 by 10 while google-chrome has a wider range 25 33 50 67 ... and other browsers may have other values

text,smaller,right
why in firefox text smaller left than in google-chrome and opera right

header,request,bigger
here the working header request with firefox bigger than google-chrome request

tooltip,delay,higher
for my website i noticed that tooltip delay in firefox was much higher than in google-chrome

text,size,larger,15px
for example if you have a text size of 15px well firefox makes a larger 15px than google-chrome does

mac,issues,worse,text
on my mac firefox has no issues whatsoever but google-chrome is worse than i think you ve noticedâ the text exceeds the bounds of the container after the resize

browser,default,longer
i want to set my own time limit rather than use the browser s default i believe google-chrome s is much longer than firefox s

width,columns,problems
firefox has like 40px less width than google-chrome in columns which is causing problems

smaller,screenshot,break-point
it looks like google-chrome is smaller in your screenshot there so firefox could just not be at the defined break-point yet

ie6,text,proper,size,bigger
in ie6 7 8 and in google-chrome text has proper size but in firefox it s bigger

height,bigger,input
why height in google-chrome is bigger than firefox of input

ie7+,longer,full
however since around 2006 think ie7+ firefox 2+ google-chrome etc browsers no longer provide the full file path they only provide the file s name without directory information

memory,errors,heights,greater,higher
i ve ran into out of memory errors on firefox with canvas heights greater than 8000 google-chrome seems to handle much higher at least to 32000

good,bigger,spaces
the code looks good in firefox but in google-chrome there are bigger spaces between the items

attribute,webkit,info,caniuse.com
firefox recognizes this attribute but webkit google-chrome safari etc don t more info on caniuse.com

line-through,style,lower,implementation,different
it seems that in firefox ie the line-through style is a bit lower than google-chrome i am not sure if this is because of the implementation of different browsers or something

button,wider
in google-chrome the button is wider than in firefox

thumbnail,smaller
firefox thumbnail 4 times smaller than on google-chrome

left-collumn,bigger,height
but in firefox the left-collumn gets a much bigger height than in google-chrome

default,textbox,padding
firefox s default textbox includes more padding than ie google-chrome

pc,fine,ie,links,picture,urls
pc google-chrome and safari are fine ie shows the links like in the picture firefox shows more revealed urls

font-face,bold,bolder
font-face bold in firefox is bolder than in google-chrome

default,behaviour,closer
google-chrome doesn t implement the sizing correctly and firefox does although in your case the default behaviour of google-chrome is closer to what you want

green,image,smaller,bigger,necessary,images,unchanged
if i remove this code the width of green image in firefox becomes smaller but it s still bigger than necessary about 100px the google-chrome images keeps unchanged

longer,input,fields
google-chrome renders longer input fields than firefox and ie

px,smaller,shadow,nothing
px firefox will display smaller and smaller shadow while when google-chrome goes below 1px it suddenly displays nothing

text,bigger,bolder
i have too problem with text in the firefox is bigger maybe bolder as in google-chrome .

issues,code.the,zoom,level,higher,earlier
google-chrome has no issues in this code.the default zoom level of firefox is higher than it was in the earlier version

text,lower
firefox text is 1px lower than in google-chrome and ie

text,area,correct,width,col,smaller
when viewing my text area in firefox it shows up a correct width col 30 however in ie and google-chrome it s significantly smaller

products,contact,1px,margin,bigger
that i gave to every link in the set of links home about us products contact and it seems that firefox is making that 1px margin much bigger than safari or google-chrome and distorting it

font-size,larger
i ve found that the font-size in firefox is a bit larger than in google-chrome

cols,issue,space,right
reducing cols fix issue on firefox but on ie google-chrome it show more space towards right

simple,extension,business,longer
this is due to the simple fact that firefox has been in the extension business longer than google-chrome or ie

footer,link,text,larger,margins,icons
this is because in ie and firefox the footer link text is larger than in google-chrome and safari therefore the margins that i ve set up for the icons do not work

fonts,thinner
even then google-chrome s fonts look thinner than in firefox or ie

top,cells,look,taller
currently with the 10px top padding the cells in google-chrome look taller than in firefox

default,font,larger
arabic default font in google-chrome is larger than it is in firefox

table,border-radius,padding,default
let s say you wanted a table border-radius of 50 on google-chrome and safari but firefox is adding more padding by default so you d like to tone it down for that browser alone to 45

font-size,smaller
if we remove the font-size it appears properly in google-chrome but shows up smaller in firefox

right,thing,0px,closer,standard
it looks like while google-chrome and safari are trying to do the right thing with 0px firefox is sticking closer to the standard

higher
i just found out that if you re using google-chrome you trigger antialiasing at 49px or higher however with firefox it s set at 257px or higher

blue,bar,matches,smaller
the height of the blue bar in safari and google-chrome matches but in firefox it is smaller

fine,assitional,css,settings,ribbon,div,higher
now this works fine in google-chrome and safari and i have had to use assitional css settings for firefox but ie and opera both display my ribbon div about 25px higher than in google-chrome or safari

text,overlay,und,broader
the next text is an overlay between firefox und google-chrome - firefox is broader

fonts,issue,font,higher,size
i know different engines render fonts differently and but the issue i m having is that firefox renders the font higher than google-chrome - at the size i am displaying the font this is very noticeable 3 or 4 px - which on a button means they re totally misaligned

top,lower,low
i have a search positioned absolutely beside my navigation but the top is 10px lower than firefox in google-chrome so basically if it is centered in firefox it hangs low on google-chrome

idea,frame,browser,correct
the idea is that if they are using ie then they must install google-chrome frame and if they are using less than firefox 4 or opera 11.5 then they must upgrade their browser not not sure if the way i am doing that is correct

polling,connection,seconds,larger
regarding frequency of polling when no connection is maintained google-chrome appears to be 3 seconds where as firefox s is much larger

passwords,smaller
google-chrome renders passwords smaller than firefox

width,browser,lower,menu
when i have a lower width for the browser firefox ie and google-chrome that is lower than 980px this fixed menu should not appear

iframe,slider,size,smaller
i have an iframe inside a list i m using a slider and on google-chrome sets its size perfectly but on firefox it has a smaller size

font,smaller,ie
in google-chrome the font appears to be 1px smaller than firefox and ie and i cannot see why

original,for-loop,loops
on windows the while loops above is 20 faster than the original for-loop in google-chrome in ie and firefox both loops perform the same

work,setting,iframed,page,larger,part,text
safari and opera work with the google-chrome setting but firefox and ie display the iframed page larger than google-chrome causing part of the text to be cut off

higher,original
in google-chrome it is appearing higher than the original in firefox

connection,docs,bigger
and i get connection was interrupted in google-chrome or connection was reset in firefox for uploading docs bigger than 4 mb

menu,links,px,smaller
my menu links seem in google-chrome correctly but in firefox my menu links are 1 px smaller than google-chrome

normal,column,smaller
it looks normal in google-chrome every column doesn t resize after updating whereas in firefox it gets smaller and smaller

issue,webdriver,higher,security,counterpart
found that the issue stemmed from using the firefox webdriver which apparently has much higher security than its google-chrome counterpart

interesting,ie9,larger,set,fine,size
what s interesting is that firefox and ie9 will process the larger data set just fine but i thought google-chrome had a larger stack size limit than either of these browsers so i would ve expected them both to fail as well

space,text
it displays ok in google-chrome and safari but in firefox it has more space between the text and the bottom border than between the text and the top border

pixels,size,bigger
that happens because pixels size in google-chrome is bigger than in firefox

inches,higher,displays
what firefox displays is about 5 inches higher than what google-chrome displays

input,button,padding
in firefox the input button has more padding than in google-chrome

green,div,bigger,different
in google-chrome the green div is bigger than in firefox i really don t know what is the problem i think in firefox it displays as it should but in google-chrome and ie9 it displays different

site,display,font-size,1px,bigger
i built a site and the problem is google-chrome display font-size 1px bigger than firefox

suffice,start,problems,larger,heights
suffice to say ie and google-chrome start having problems at larger heights than does firefox

font,left,space,top
the font rendered in google-chrome left have more space on the top versus firefox

limit,lower,versions
internet explorer s limit is lower than firefox s or google-chrome s and varies between versions

text,bigger
but the text turns out to be much bigger under firefox compared to that under google-chrome

linux,text,pixel,higher
on linux google-chrome displays text about one pixel higher than firefox and opera

lower
in firefox it seems that this is 1px lower than in google-chrome and safari

space
firefox produces more space compared to google-chrome

button,tad,smaller
in google-chrome the button should be a tad smaller than in firefox

select,box,taller,element,container,blue
the reason this is happening is because firefox renders the select box as a taller element than google-chrome and the container of the blue text is getting caught on the select s container element because it s now sticking out lower than the others

importance,body,margin,style,higher
google-chrome placed more importance on your body margin than firefox did and used your style as higher priority

right, information, console, ---------------------------------------------------

console,information
the google-chrome console gives more information than the firefox console

mozilla,right,hand
they show up centered on mozilla firefox but in google-chrome it aligns more to the right hand side

right,information,access-control-allow-origin
on firefox all seems right and a 200 code is returned but with google-chrome you have more information and will see a access-control-allow-origin error

right,developers
thus i think firefox is perhaps more right but other developers at google-chrome think otherwise

information,captcha
on firefox they ask for more information and they show a captcha but not on google-chrome

first,console
in google-chrome it seems more or less ok but in firefox when i first tried it it should give me not logged in my console

browsers, image, webkit-based, ---------------------------------------------------

effective,browsers
it s more effective with firefox more than google-chrome or any other browsers

browsers,instance,white
notably this doesn t happen in all browsers google-chrome renders more smoothly than ie and firefox for instance but is there any way i can make those white lines stop appearing when the user zooms in

webkit-based,browsers,closer
all the webkit-based browsers safari google-chrome and opera should be closer in their rendering to each other than firefox or ie 9 separately

method,image,lighter
however with this method image in firefox appears to be blurred at least if resized and in google-chrome it looks lighter sic

webkit-based,browsers,testing
if you are trying to support all users on all browsers then you will certainly need to do testing on those browsers although actively developing on those browsers may not be necessary whereas if you only need to support webkit-based browsers google-chrome safari or webkit-based browsers and firefox that is less testing that you need to do

lower,image,ie-9,browsers,animation
animation effect works fine for the lower image with firefox and ie-9 browsers whereas google-chrome does not show animation

browsers,instance,lenient
browsers like google-chrome for instance won t allow it where as firefox can be more lenient in some cases

browsers,newer
the function is available in browsers newer than google-chrome 39 and firefox 31

tolerant,image,headers
firefox is more tolerant when it comes to image headers then ie and google-chrome

5x5,table,22px
update3 now it works here which means that i couldn t fully reproduce my bug to show it to you but in general the problem is that the height of 5x5 table in google-chrome is less from firefox on 22px which is 22px gap between table container and a table itself

table,image,horizontal,scroll
in ie and google-chrome the table ends up under my image while in firefox it takes more that 100 an horizontal scroll bar is displayed

closer,bottom
in ie and firefox fullscreen_block appears closer to the bottom than in safari and google-chrome

browsers,background,whiter,brighter
in firefox and other browsers the background is much whiter and brighter than in google-chrome

lenient,illegal,characters,url
maybe google-chrome is more lenient when it comes to illegal characters in the url than firefox or something like that

specificity.bootstrap,specific,menu,selector
solved the problem came from css specificity.bootstrap s css was judged more specific by google-chrome regarding my menu s selector but not by firefox and safari

tolerant,button,bad,selector
google-chrome was more tolerant showed the button while firefox caught the bad selector

internet, explorer, variations, ---------------------------------------------------

internet,explorer,strict,security
it seems that google-chrome internet explorer or safari are more strict than firefox on terms of security

font,good,internet,explorer,mozilla,darker
i am using franklin gothic font for website and font looks good on google-chrome and safari but on internet explorer and mozilla firefox it looks darker

process,mozilla,font-size,declaration,font-families,smaller,internet,explorer
my website in developing process looking in mozilla firefox with same font-size declaration margin padding and different font-families always a few smaller than in google-chrome or internet explorer

declaration,arial,show,huge,variations,smaller,variations.
when using a font declaration of arial firefox and ie11 show relatively huge variations while google-chrome and opera show smaller variations.

message,default,internet,explorer
answers in opera was checking browser support for my page and wanted to search some stuff up. i don t get this message in my default browser google-chrome nor in internet explorer or firefox

life,browsers,internet,explorer,flexible
in that sense real life browsers firefox internet explorer google-chrome etc are much more flexible

dropdown,dropdownoption,internet,explorer,forgiving,weird
while clicking open the dropdown before selecting the dropdownoption i wanted worked in google-chrome and internet explorer firefox was less forgiving and showed the weird behaviour

strict, date, standards, ---------------------------------------------------

permissive,delimiters,date,dashes
google-chrome is more permissive with delimiters when it comes to dates thus formatting the date with dashes works with google-chrome but not with firefox

restrictions,files,strict,middle
apple s safari applies almost no cross domain restrictions to files opened locally but firefox is much more strict about what it permits with google-chrome somewhere in the middle

strict,errors
ie7 is strict enough and used to give me javascript errors on them maybe google-chrome does it too firefox is more relaxed d

smart,things,strict,standards
google-chrome is smart enough to guess where things should be closed and still work correctly but firefox has more strict of standards

lax,security,restriction,strict,mixed-content
it works in firefox because firefox is more lax about this security restriction and google-chrome happens to be more strict on mixed-content errors

strict,things,commas
google-chrome s parsing may be more strict than firefox is at having things like trailing commas as specified by the standard at as stated in danilo celic s answer

doesnt,date,format,flexible
firefox doesnt support the date format you have entered while google-chrome is more flexible and does support it

strict,change
probably firefox just ignores it but google-chrome is more strict change code to

strict
is this due to firefox being more strict than google-chrome

locale-specific,date,time,formats,pickier
google-chrome can read lots of locale-specific date time formats but firefox is pickier

cannot,weather,invalid,date,doesnt
here google-chrome cannot decide weather ma stands for march or may and gives an invalid date while firefox doesnt

tests,strict,standards,cookie,manipulation
i think from my tests perhaps firefox has more strict standards than google-chrome about cookie manipulation

strict
google-chrome is a bit more strict than firefox here

stricter, data, seconds, ---------------------------------------------------

stricter
google-chrome seems to allow this i do not know why but firefox is somewhat stricter

correct,stricter,base,uri
i d say that firefox is correct in being stricter than google-chrome here even though i m not entirely sure the base uri has changed and this new uri should be used for the relative uri #symboltype1 too

policy,stricter
but i am still curios why is the policy set stricter with google-chrome than for example firefox

more-so
it looks like it shows for firefox more-so than google-chrome but it might help

flow,seconds
in google-chrome the same flow renders in 13 seconds but firefox takes more than 51 seconds

data,seconds
using the same data google-chrome does in less than 5 seconds what took ie and firefox 10 to 15 seconds to accomplish

stricter,data,local
google-chrome is stricter than firefox when it comes to loading data from your local filesystem

pickier
apparently google-chrome is pickier than firefox

earlier, fine, root, ---------------------------------------------------

earlier,freezing,glitch
if google-chrome seems to finish earlier than firefox then that is the freezing glitch in action

fine,requests,exception
it works fine in firefox but in google-chrome it sends more than one requests to servlet and finally there is exception in servlet and it doesn t work

xml_url,fine,earlier,root
the window.external.addsearchprovider xml_url works fine in firefox as earlier the problem is only with the google-chrome since google-chrome supported earlier and don t know the root cause of not able to add now

ram, memory, ---------------------------------------------------

memory
firefox allocates lots of memory during that preloading up to 20-30 times more than google-chrome or safari do and even twice as much as ie

ram
we use google-chrome though which i believe uses more ram than firefox

smarter, careless, onunload, ---------------------------------------------------

smarter,careless
i guess google-chrome is smarter about me being careless than firefox is

onunload,smarter,mark
turns out using onunload is behaving as documented in firefox but google-chrome is just smarter with it or something still investigating but i ll mark this question as answered

error, weird, server, ---------------------------------------------------

weird,error,specific,issue
google-chrome shows weird error but firefox shows more specific issue

permission,error,reproducible
this does not seem to occur in safari or ie and a similar permission error occurs sometimes in firefox but is reproducible more often than not in google-chrome

server,google,error
when i run my http web server on google google-chrome it gives more 324 error than in firefox

weird,error,clearer
in your example fn is attempting to call call but it s not specifying the context which typically defaults to the window object but in this case it just makes it undefined which triggers a weird error in google-chrome as you discovered but firefox is clearer about the problem

css,line,cool,error
you forgot to open the so no more css after this line is considered in firefox and ie google-chrome is more cool on the error

strict, switch, object, ---------------------------------------------------

ie9,proper,domain,strict,localstorate,object,need
firefox and ie9 require a proper domain to run from presumably because they are more strict than google-chrome in the way they associate the localstorate object to a domain in google-chrome it doesn t need to be a domain as such

ie11,strict,blacklisting,gpus,switch,hardware
i believe that ie11 only uses software and firefox may be less strict with its blacklisting of gpus but that doesn t explain why google-chrome can t switch to software when hardware is unavailable

second, seconds, time, ---------------------------------------------------

longer,milliseconds,reduction,run,time
however firefox takes significantly longer to run this code about 180 milliseconds on firefox compared to roughly 30 on ie and google-chrome and does not see that same reduction in run time that ie and google-chrome does

dom,children,vs,sec,seconds,second
for example try hiding a dom of of 200+ children in google-chrome vs safari vs firefox you will notice google-chrome takes 20+ sec safari takes 5+ seconds firefox takes less than 1 second

page,fast,acceptable,second,time,seconds
i ve tried to load the page on google-chrome not blazingly fast but acceptable less than 1 second then tried on firefox takes more time between 2 and 3 seconds

others---------------------------------------------------

mine,testing,faster,dot,syntax,keen
as you can see here a friend of mine did some testing and it seems that google-chrome and ie work a lot faster with the dot syntax while firefox and safari are more keen on the key syntax

note,closer,intended,css3,definition,table,box
but given what the note says above i would say that ie and firefox are closer to the intended css3 definition since in google-chrome you can t seem to change a table s box model using the box-sizing property

vertical,spacing,real,estate,tag,perfect,extra
the vertical spacing in firefox between the real estate search h2 tag and the form input field for san francisco ca #city-field input tag is perfect but in google-chrome google-chrome is applying more extra vertical spacing than desired

letters,pointy,ends,solid,bold
the google-chrome renders the letters using pointy ends but the firefox uses more solid and bold effect

browser,thing,extension,responsible,developement,ui,windows,mac,slow,os,respective,chrome.still,faster,incognito,temporary,files,huge,size
i think it mostly depends on the interprter engine in browser which responsible for interpreting th scripts which server sends to your browser and another thing about firefox as you have mentioned the extension in firefox is also responsible for it and another thing which i think matters a lot the developement of the browser as you can see google-chrome has same ui on all windows linux mac since it is mostly written in java so it requires jvm to run hence it is slow as compared to firefox which is written separately for each os using the respective oss apis hence it is fast since it directly interacts with os than interacting with jvm which in turn interacts with os like in case of chrome.still google-chrome is faster in incognito mode because of its intelligence to keep frequently data cached if you ll see the temporary files created by google-chrome they are huge in size as compared to that of firefox

beeing,cut,known,issue,print,css,better,versions
graph beeing cut in google-chrome is a known issue google-chrome does not respect some print css and works much better with firefox not all versions still

ellipsis,user,friendly
ellipsis still wraps in google-chrome but is more user friendly in firefox by adding the .

close,specs,opt,initial,testing
btw google-chrome is less close to w3c specs than firefox de 42+ i d opt to start using firefox for your initial testing and then test it in ch to detect quirks

individual,paths,gecko,webkit,browsers,better,job
fwiw i was able to solve my problem with greensock using tweenmax to animate individual paths inside and this worked in firefox gecko and webkit browsers safari google-chrome it does a better job of calculating the origin not exactly sure how but it worked for me

window
firefox window was less than 991px so appeared to be working google-chrome window was 991 so appeared to not be working

time
in firefox it takes some more time compared to google-chrome safari

common,related
firefox for example has a lot in common with google-chrome and safari and google-chrome and safari are even more so closely related

sticking,debugging,angular,experience,better,typescript,files
i m sticking with firefox debugging of my angular 2 app outside of vs code as its user experience is better than google-chrome especially when working with typescript files so i ll stick with that for now unless i can figure this out

state,object,point,loop,end
firefox is more technically correct in this case as it outputs the state of the object at each point in the loop whereas google-chrome is apparently waiting until the end of the loop to output each console.log but i m not aware of a standards specification that covers the console host object

responsive
but firefox keeps being less responsive than google-chrome or ie

function,declarations,expressions
google-chrome decided to treat them as function declarations and hoists them firefox treats them more like function expressions

numbers,platforms,long,run
i ve been trying to sum up values over a swipe and see how different browsers report values and they vary a lot with safari reporting order of magnitude bigger numbers on almost all platforms google-chrome reporting quite more like 3 times more than firefox firefox being balanced on the long run but quite different among platforms on small movements on ubuntu gnome nearly only +3 or -3 seems like it sums up smaller events and then send a big +3

use,main,browser,verbose,errors
i use google-chrome as my main browser but sometimes firefox has much more verbose errors warnings that can make debugging a complex issue easier

harsher,sooner,ms
this problem was harsher in firefox 24 than in google-chrome 29 since firefox would crash sooner around 2000 ms sooner than google-chrome

recent,builds,strict,regard
google-chrome recent builds only and firefox are behaving very strict in this regard no matter how much content you have it will be no bigger than your viewport while opera presto behaves more like a table 100 is treated as a minimum not a maximum

sort,future,element,context,b,firebug,thing
you might be able to avoid asking this sort of question in the future if you start using a google-chrome s inspect element context menu command or b firebug for firefox which is more or less the same thing

facebook,someone,open,source,developers,math.min,modification,chromium,right,sense,b,similar,speed,faster,slower
when i posted this on facebook someone said that since firefox is open source project developers optimized math.min but google-chrome didn t since google-chrome is just a modification of chromium but beside that above statement is not quite right that makes no sense because that doesn t explain the reason why google-chrome s and firefox s math.min a b performs in similar speed and google-chrome s math.min a b and firefox s performs in same speed because if firefox is faster than google-chrome then google-chrome s math.min a b should be much slower than firefox s

tasks,gc,task,secondary,higher,priority
if the loop is very tight time-budget-wise there will simply not be any room for the browser to do other tasks such as gc - for google-chrome this task seem to be secondary versus firefox which gives this higher priority likely to get more performance out of its engine

complexity,page,som,jank,paint,scroll,worse,better
i planned on using svgs for the entire site but with only 20-30 svg images of medium to high complexity used in the page and google-chrome already seems to be showing som jank and high paint times for scroll and firefox is even worse though safari seems to do a lot better

plugin,solution,low-level,http,stuff,better,anyone,idea
given these last two complications i am leaning towards a browser plugin as the solution probably firefox since low-level http stuff seems to be better supported than in google-chrome but i am wondering if anyone has an idea for a more cross-browser-y solution and or if there is something out there that might provide a good api for this kind of thing

document,flexibility
firefox may be sniffing the document s encoding with more flexibility than google-chrome is

operation,notable,darker,use,edge
not all browsers support all operation most notable is firefox not supporting darker use multiply instead but google-chrome edge and firefox support all the others listed above

longer
firefox takes almost 3 times longer than google-chrome

persnickety,defaults,printout
obviously google-chrome is more persnickety whereas firefox defaults to moving and sizing the printout as necessary

last,contrary,possible,first
firefox apply the last one contrary to google-chrome and ie it s possible that they consider that the first .gecko.single-portfolio renders the whole rule invalid

efficient
so why is google-chrome less efficient than firefox and ie

newer,functions,v39.0,support,v50
firefox has supported the newer functions since v39.0 google-chrome is slated to get support in v50

site,security,fussier,loads,errors,resources,non
i ve learned partly by trawling this site that the google-chrome security is fussier and the app loads correctly without errors in firefox and ie but i can t find any resources that are loaded from a non https source

support,test,thisâ,little,noticeable
support exists in firefox and my test just confirmed thisâ but the handle is a little less noticeable than in google-chrome

thing,reality,face
often google-chrome is understanding more thing then it should and firefox is bringing you the reality back in your face eheh


this is to get it in firefox to be more like in google-chrome

characters
firefox encodes more characters than google-chrome

frequent
this doesn t happen in google-chrome and is less frequent in firefox than in ie

files
in google-chrome there is more files download 47 than in firefox ie 42

latest,helpful
unlike google-chrome which dies silently the latest firefox is more helpful

revocation,shorter,timeout
google-chrome does not check revocation in most cases and firefox might use a shorter timeout and ignore failures

value,dublin,cleaver,enough,input,text,gullible,variable
surly the input type should be text if the value expected is dublin -- google-chrome might be cleaver enough to recognise that the input is actually text whereas firefox and ie might be more gullible and not even try to set the variable

use,network,development,cross,origin,tool,detailed
use firefox network in development tools and check your requests sometimes it just sends options request in cross origin i insist on firefox because it s network tool is much more detailed than google-chrome and safari

devtools,features
having said that the google-chrome devtools as well as the firefox devtools have many more features and other smaller and bigger advantages over firebug as the team behind firebug is very small in comparison to the teams behind the other devtools

system,ie7,reachable,goal
the advantage that you have is that unlike upgrading an operating system upgrading from ie7 to google-chrome 8 or firefox 3.6 is a more reachable goal for the average user of your app especially if you provide a link and upgrade instructions


firefox is clearly less secured it deliberately allows something that google-chrome locks down

testing,nicer,pops-up,unresponsive,alert,care
in my testing google-chrome is nicer it pops-up the unresponsive alert whereas firefox apparently doesn t care

market,html5
firefox safari google-chrome and opera make up more than 30 of the market and they support many html5 standards

cleaner,memory,complete,hash,tricks,cause,large,array
but do keep in mind you re optimizing for a particular js engine when you re doing that v8-optimized code might generate cleaner memory in google-chrome and safari but for all you know ie might make a complete hash of things or some of the tricks you ve used cause firefox to slow down more than a fairly large array would have done in the first place

property,element,webkit,things,center,standards,compliant
the center align property must be cascading from some other element because it s not only safari google-chrome which also uses webkit but also opera that shows the things center aligned and both safari google-chrome and opera are more standards compliant than ie and even firefox

current,setup,narrower,minimum,min-width,600px,styles,layout.css
try your current setup in google-chrome google-chrome typically has a narrower minimum viewport width and try something like min-width 600px in firefox and your styles should be applied as expected layout.css will be applied when the viewport is at least 600px wide

css3,linear-gradients,pleasant,alternative
i m trying to add a ribbon to a page using css3 linear-gradients but the rendering in google-chrome looks a lot less pleasant than its firefox or ie alternative

values,background-position
to answer my own question neither google-chrome nor firefox support more than two values in background-position

local,description,datachannel,sdp,shorter,information
however a sdp object local description by firefox does not contain datachannel at all and moreover the sdp is much shorter than google-chrome and less information bundled

browser,best-guess,individual,chars,fatter,things
it works fine even for italics but i m aware that the user s browser is being asked to make a best-guess here and have noticed that google-chrome will make individual chars appear slightly fatter than firefox when i do things this way

coverage,market,half,huge,strong
in any case vorbis clearly has the most coverage google-chrome has more of the market than safari now opera is about half of safari and obviously firefox is huge and it doesn t really have the strong opposition that theora has

hiccup,fix,picky,svg,attributes
i had a hiccup in firefox but found a fix after figuring out firefox is a bit more picky than google-chrome when defining svg attributes

higher,severity,possible,cause
google-chrome is reporting the missing key with a higher severity than firefox is so i want to eliminate that as a possible cause

browsers,behavior,insert,first,disaster,inconsistency,br
the second happened when you remove everything and starting type and hit enter different browsers behavior very differently google-chrome insert very first line as a just text node of contenteditable container and than put every new line into div opera 12.12 handle it better and it never allows remove last div node ie9-10 starting jump around and after you started again uses p tags instead of div that s not even such a disaster just inconsistency but yet the firefox is not yet even trying to change it s br behavior

specific
but it does seem like adding will make firefox behave more like google-chrome in this specific case

flexible,sense
google-chrome is more flexible in this sense than firefox which is why it works there

likely,straightaway,family,resemblance
so if something works on safari it s more likely to work straightaway on google-chrome more than it is on firefox - but that s just a family resemblance at the end of the day you ll still have to test each as every webkit browser product and version still uses a different version of webkit

engines,main.js,main.v8.js,main.nitro.js,main.gecko.js
i also have .js files being redirected to javascript engines as well for main.js in google-chrome it tries main.v8.js in safari main.nitro.js in firefox main.gecko.js

bad,habits,happy,format,stricter
google-chrome is letting me get into bad habits and is happy to parse that format but firefox is stricter

cssdesk,method,breaks,work,number
you can view it live on cssdesk this method works in a lot more than google-chrome but breaks in firefox 3.0 and just doesn t work in a number of ie versions

trickier,bug,situation,slower,amount,buffer
this is trickier to work around and you should file a google-chrome bug describing the situation and where it s slower than firefox but you could potentially reduce the amount of buffer uploads by looking into instancing or using uniform arrays instead of updating vertexes for positions textures

ideas,spacing
any ideas why google-chrome is apply more spacing than firefox ie

works,good,html5,url
this all works well and good in firefox but when i try it in google-chrome which supports more html5 features it tries to load the url undefined in whatever directory i m in

check,cross-browser,thinking
check in firefox in google-chrome we have a cross-browser thinking

svg,content
is it possible to adjust rendering of svg content on safari and google-chrome to resemble more firefox rendering

cells
this happens in firefox and also in google-chrome cells shrink less in google-chrome but not in safari

noticeable
in firefox it s less noticeable but in google-chrome it s very noticeable

donâ,launch,time,equal,2ms,faster,difference,empty
but if firebug donâ t enabled after launch firefox â time equal 2ms that faster than opera and google-chrome and difference between empty filled array disappears

bug,unresolved,issue,specification,functionality
is this a google-chrome bug an unresolved issue with the specification or is firefox simply providing more functionality than required

mouse,clicks
is there a way to get firefox to behave more like google-chrome when it comes to focus being set by mouse clicks without having to sacrifice accessibility by setting outline to none or 0

mean,point
or does this mean firefox is less secured on that point than google-chrome

basic,for-loop,i--,--i,slower
in google-chrome a basic for-loop is faster than i-- and --i while in firefox it s slower

looks,different,browsers,saturated,background-color,rgb
i have just noticed a site i am working on looks different in google-chrome than other browsers saf firefox everything is more saturated in google-chrome even a background-color rgb

visible,subtle,distinguishable
it s clearly visible in firefox and is far more subtle yet also distinguishable in google-chrome

widths,larger,number,os,version,phase,moon
google-chrome always reports 250 for both widths as expected but firefox always reports a larger number though the exact number may depend on the os and or version of firefox and or phase of the moon

suspect,need,content,div,earlier
i suspect that this may be the case because ie and google-chrome need to know about the content of the div earlier than firefox

slice,use-case,literal,slower,machine,lke,difference
looks like for the slice use-case on google-chrome using a literal is about 4 slower on my machine on firefox it s more lke 9 with no difference at all on ie10


firefox can get away with more than google-chrome before aborting
