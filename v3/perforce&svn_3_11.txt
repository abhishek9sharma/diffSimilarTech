tortoise, checkout, git, ---------------------------------------------------

tortoise-,git,merge,tools,better
the tortoise- svn git merge tools or that of perforce are way better here

faster,check-outs,server
perforce is soooo much faster than svn because all the check-outs are stored on the server so it doesn t have to check every file on an update

better,network,server,checkout
svn works much better when disconnected from the network - with perforce you have to tell the server when you ve done a checkout

others---------------------------------------------------

ericgorr,right,nicer
if you have the money ericgorr is right perforce is much nicer to work with then svn

easier,intuitive
if anything i find working with svn easier and more intuitive than perforce

cvs,bamboo,users
since perforce is less commonly used compared to cvs svn amongst bamboo users we generally get less feedback about it and hear less about existing issues

support,oses,devs,comfortable
perforce does have support for many other oses but our non-windows devs feel more comfortable with svn too

advanced,capabilities
perforce offers more advanced branching and merging capabilities than svn

scm,clearcase,maven,integration,community,examples,git
if you want to a little bit further you can imagine use more powerfull scm clearcase perforce ... but maven integration is fewer not well documented and community provide less examples than svn or git

faster,scalable,commercial,product,rational,clearcase
and if you just want something faster or more scalable than svn then just buy a commercial product - i ve used both perforce and rational clearcase and they scale up to huge projects without any problems

great,git,free
while perforce is great svn git are more than ok free and widely supported
