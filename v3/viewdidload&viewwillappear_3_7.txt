location, view, viewdidappear, ---------------------------------------------------

location,better,place
if you insist on having the location before viewdidload is called viewwillappear would be a better place then you have to hold off pushing that viewcontroller until you have a sufficient location

viewdidappear,better
you may find using viewdidload rather than viewwillappear or viewdidappear may work better in this case you can set your view up with a loading holding graphic or animation trigger your asynchronous networking call and then once complete display the required information

second,view,better,background
in your viewdidload on the second view or viewwillappear is probably better set the background image to the image you put in the property

others---------------------------------------------------

note,calls,viewwilldisappear,easier,multiple
important note placing these calls in viewwillappear and viewwilldisappear instead of viewdidload makes this easier to handle as it will work reliably even for multiple pushes and pops of the same view controller and you won t have to clean up after it in the previous view controller

good,view,first,time,call,button
yes you can query it in viewdidload but if you do it in viewwillappear will be more good because viewdidload calls once when view loading first time and never called again until unless view will deloc but viewwillappear call every time for example you have one view and it have navigation view inside and you navigate inside the other view so when you press back button viewdidload will not call but yes viewwillappear will always call

method,earlier,incorrect
which describes using viewwillappear method instead of viewdidload called earlier and incorrect values for bounds

observer,unregister,viewwilldisappear,viewdidunload,memory,notification
i d nevertheless suggest you register as observer in viewwillappear and unregister in viewwilldisappear since viewdidunload is called only when memory has to be freed meaning viewdidload get called much more often than viewdidunload and then you might have the problem of getting the same notification more than once
