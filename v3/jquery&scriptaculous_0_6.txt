scriptaculous can do what jquery provides plus more

prototype,better,cakephp,ajax
i ended up using prototype scriptaculous which are better integrated with cakephp than jquery to manually do ajax using prototype s ajax functionality with cakephp s requesthandler to determine when to return ajax

prototype,projects,plug-in,available
i have used both prototype scriptaculous as well as jquery in many projects and based on what i am seeing it appears jquery has the more plug-in available so am leaning towards using jquery

animations,smoother,configurable,ui
i ended up using scriptaculous for most of my animations simply because it provides smoother animations and more configurable than what jquery ui provides

kind,impression,drag,drop,better,ui
i also kind of get the impression that scriptaculous drag and drop is better than jquery ui drag and drop based on the online demos

better
it was working with scriptaculous before but we didn t decide to use that due to jquery working better for us and this is what worked before
