better
if you re just going to use vim the same way you use gedit don t bother - gedit is better than vim at being gedit

powerful,feel,emacs
i don t know anything about except that it s more powerful than gedit but doesn t have the same feel as vim emacs

linux,ease,use,files,better
if you are on linux eg ubuntu you may try gedit for ease of use with some plug-ins but to handle very large files you re better off with vim

moment,kate,better
if vim seems too much by the moment i think that kate is better than gedit
