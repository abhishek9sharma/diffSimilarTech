look, past, better, ---------------------------------------------------

look,better
i suggest you to give a look to tcpdf which is far better than fpdf also because it is actively developed

past,better
i ve used tcpdf in the past and found it a lot better than fpdf

others---------------------------------------------------

good,news,better,utf8,modern
somewhat good news you could move to tcpdf which is much better at handling utf8 and is more modern in general than fpdf

demonstration,presentation,in-built,capabilities
the demonstration of tcpdf i saw at the following presentation showed that tcpdf may have more in-built capabilities the fpdf

side,note,fork,better,supports
on a side note i d recommend using tcpdf instead - it s a fork of fpdf that has better supports for utf8 among some other improvements

slower
tcpdf was always slower than fpdf

information,things,faster,confirmation,slower
if anyone has some information on this problem i d really appreciate it - either things you did to make tcpdf faster or just confirmation that it runs slower than fpdf so i can forget about it and just stick with fpdf
