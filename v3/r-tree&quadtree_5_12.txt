window, queries, neighbours, ---------------------------------------------------

faster,window,queries
r-tree are substantially faster than quadtree for window queries like inside contains covers etc

faster,nearest,neighbours
r-tree are much faster than quadtree for nearest neighbours queries

indexes,faster
quadtree indexes are created faster than r-tree

easier, fast, faster, ---------------------------------------------------

easier,fast
quadtree are easier to implement r-tree can be twice as fast than quadtree

faster
maybe a r-tree or a quadtree can be faster

others---------------------------------------------------

better,perfomance
you can also try a quadtree it has some better perfomance over a r-tree

better,kd-trees,r,trees,faster,updates
there are other multidimensional trees that are usually better than kd-trees quadtree r trees like r-tree but much faster for updates or ph-tree

wikipedia,article,mapping,k-d,tree
on the other hand the wikipedia article on r-tree seems more specifically targeted towards mapping than the k-d tree or quadtree

use,super,flexible
i use quadtree more than r-tree and find them super flexible

simpler,data,structure
a quadtree is a simpler data structure than the r-tree

objects,sparse,related,data,structure,etc.,better
if your objects are sparse then a quadtree or related data structure r-tree etc. is probably better

point,effective,need
i believe instead of r-tree a point quadtree would be more effective for your need
