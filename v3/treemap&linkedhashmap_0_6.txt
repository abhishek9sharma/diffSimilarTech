faster,insertion,wonâ,values,ejp
linkedhashmap is faster for insertion because it wonâ t have to unnecessarily compare values while inserting like treemap as stated by ejp

iteration,slower
it sounds like you need a treemap which has iteration which is not much slower than linkedhashmap and does what you really want

faster,performance,containskey,get,javadocs,each.
however a linkedhashmap is faster as seen here treemap has o log n performance for containskey get put and remove according to the javadocs while linkedhashmap is o 1 for each.

reasonable
consider using a linkedhashmap or a treemap to maintain a more reasonable ordering

order,insertion,better
you can use treemap instead of linkedhashmap because you dont want to retain the order of insertion and for sorting treemap is better choice

nothing,project
a treemap costs a lot more than a linkedhashmap and adds nothing to your project if you only need to keep original insertion order
