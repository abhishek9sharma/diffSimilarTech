specifics,problems,powerful,older,mature,pex,fun,tutorial
sorry can t give you specifics on the problems i faced - typemock was definitely more powerful to use as it is a lot older and mature - pex moles is fun though i found the tutorial for sharepoint rather nice unit testing sharepoint foundation with microsoft pex and mole

tests,slower,faster,ms
i have no concrete figures on that but from my own experience i d estimate that instrumented tests are around 100-400 slower typemock seeming to be faster than ms moles
