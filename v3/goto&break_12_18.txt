nested, loops, better, ---------------------------------------------------

idea,nth,nested,loop,worse,structural,perspective
the idea of saying break out of the nth nested loop is worse than a goto from a structural perspective

better,nested,loops
but goto is better than break when you have nested loops like that

better,statements.
basically continue and break are better but often just disguised goto statements.

previous,example,better
in the previous example break is better than goto

better,purpose
labeled break like in java would be better than goto for this purpose

nested,loop,loops,cleaner,simpler,statements,if-checks
if you re in a nested loop and need to break out of all loops a goto can make this much cleaner and simpler than break statements and if-checks

labels, restrictive, equivalent, ---------------------------------------------------

equivalent,restrictive,labels,statements
it is the equivalent of a goto but is more restrictive in that labels may be used only in break or continue statements

statements,older,languages
those break statements are being used in the same way that goto is used in older languages

end, bad, l, ---------------------------------------------------

bad,end,loop
the bad we use a break that is little more than a tamed goto something like goto the end of the loop

graceful,l,faster,loop
there s not really a graceful way to break out of for l although it is much faster than a goto loop

good, programming, solution, ---------------------------------------------------

developer,c-like,better,cleaner,solution
to any seasoned developer of a c-like language break will both read better as well as provide a cleaner solution than goto

opinion,better,good,programming
nevertheless in my opinion break is not much better than goto its both not a good programming style

others---------------------------------------------------

note,mention,flexible,bash
in particular note the mention of break and continue which aren t as flexible as goto but are more flexible in bash than in some languages and may help you achieve what you want

nothing,pleasant,syntax
continue and break are nothing more than a pleasant syntax for a goto

normal,use,clearer,constructs,look,moreso
in the cleanup even in normal case scenario i would regard the use of goto as being clearer than the do while 0 constructs among other things because the target labels themselves practically cry out look at me far moreso than the break and do while 0 constructs

pundits,like,point,readability,well-chosen,readable,correct
there are pundits who don t like break continue and the like but at some point there is a tradeoff to make between rules of thumb and readability and a well-chosen break continue or even goto may become more readable than politically correct code

worse
but break is no better or worse than goto

resemblance,instructions,comparison
but actually break has more resemblance to return both instructions jump out of a block of code which is pretty much structured in comparison to goto
