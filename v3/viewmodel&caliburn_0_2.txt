command,binding,event,general,micro
how can i connect a method and not a command with a binding from the viewmodel to an attached event to ask in a more general way with caliburn micro

easier,property,selecteditem
with caliburn it is even easier since you just need to bind a property on your viewmodel to selecteditem
