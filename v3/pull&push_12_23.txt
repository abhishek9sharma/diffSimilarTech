scalable, starters, ---------------------------------------------------

scalable
i have found that pull is more scalable than push

scalable,starters
why do you think that push is far more scalable then pull for starters

subscriptions, notification, iphones, ---------------------------------------------------

performance,better
is the performance of pull better than push in this scenario

model,better
the reason the pull model works better than the push model in this case is as follow

notification,better,iphones
how are push notification better than pull notification on iphones

better,git
before do git pull and git push it s better to make sure that git status result is contain text working directory clean

answers,better,best
as stated by other answers neither push nor pull is better but rather you should pick the one that best fits your design needs

subscriptions,better,wan
pull subscriptions perform much better than push subscriptions in a wan scenario

model
i guess one of them is that the push model is less coupled then the pull model

mechanism, message, suitable, ---------------------------------------------------

idea,signalr,mechanism,method,suitable
using signalr is not a good idea because signalr using push mechanism to notify but it seems in your case some pull method is more suitable and also signalr doesn t support really permanent queue to keep messages in queue while consumers being ready

heartbeat,mechanism,model,easier,efficient
a heartbeat mechanism pull model is definitely easier to implement but a push model is far more efficient

message,processing,model,better,rebus
if in-order processing is required a much better design would be to use another message processing library that supports a pull model which i think would fit your scenario much better than rebus push model

others---------------------------------------------------

cursor,open,cheaper
i guess i m just surprised that the documentation recommends the approach of querying presumably continually in my case versus keeping a tailable cursor open i would have thought that push would be cheaper than pull

subtleties,architecture,xmlreader,simpler,easier
if you don t understand the subtleties between push vs pull architecture then i recommend that you start with xmlreader because pull is simpler to understand and easier to visualize

new,features,request,branch,second,original,project
i create new branch add those new features and than i once again made pull request but now the features i implemented in the master branch are also in my new branch so my second pull request has more features than i want to push to the original project

models,higher,throughput
push models have higher throughput than pull models

events,forstall,notifications,better,background,processes,technology
at both events forstall stated that push notifications were a better means to maintain battery life than background processes which are used for pull technology as far as receiving notifications are concerned

little,style,duplicate
a little more pull than push style that s because there is no duplicate item.

irony,xslt,stylesheets,idiomatic
there is a certain irony here given that within xslt push stylesheets are generally more idiomatic than pull stylesheets

user,connection,new,values,server
is there a way to register that user connection and act more as a push if new values exist in the server rather than every user pull new values every 1 sec for example

requests,complicated,order,request,repository,someone,git,term,original,meaning,shared,location,person
pull requests are more complicated because in order to make a pull request you must either open your repository to someone else who can run git pull 2 â this is where the term comes from and is the original meaning of pull request â or else find or create a shared repository push some of your commits to this shared location and then ask the other person to obtain your commits from the shared location

better,answer,class,new,object
alone push is better in the accepted answer can t quite work as a push-operation in some class can require a new pull at the pushed object

pg
update db pull and db push have been deprecated and should be replaced with pg pull and pg push - read more at
