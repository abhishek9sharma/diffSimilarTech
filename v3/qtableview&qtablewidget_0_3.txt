easier,qtablemodel,backend
the qtablewidget is slightly easier to implement than the qtableview which also needs a qtablemodel as backend but it has less capabilities

faster,sec,min,solution,easer
qtableview was more faster about 30 sec than qtablewidget about 1.5 min but solution with qtablewidget was easer

data,database,better
after managing to get my connection and pull data from the database i read that using qtableview as opposed to qtablewidget would be better for what i am trying to achieve
