strcpy,difference,data,byte,string,time
memset behaves like strcpy but the difference is that memcpy copied the data as it is byte but strcpy copies the formatted string as well so takes more time than memcpy to execute

complicated
i suggest you starting with memset instead though since memcpy is much more complicated than you might think

least,b,len,slower,lazy
at the very least i would have expected that before memset b 0 len that memcpy would be slower because the of lazy allocation first touch on the first of the 100 iterations

slower,operations
the problem is that memcpy is only slighly slower than memset when i expect it to be about two times slower since it operations on twice the memory

understandable,faster
it is understandable that memset is faster than memcpy

datasrc,first,slower,pages
as you have already seen when you eliminate memset datasrc 0 n the first memcpy is even slower because the pages for the source must be allocated as well
