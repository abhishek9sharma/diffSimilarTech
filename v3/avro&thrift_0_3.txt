need,writables,serialization,entity,so-called,genericrecord
but avro offers far more than just doing away with the need for your own writables although that is in my view a considerable plus it offers fairly efficient serialization the choice between serializing against generated entity classes like thrift requires or using a so-called genericrecord structure instead and not having to have tagged data

api,powerful,rest
if you are developing your hbase application in java i recommend using the raw hbase api - that is more powerful than thrift rest avro etc

worth,protobuf,solutions,market
also it is worth mentioning that besides thrift protobuf and avro there are some more solutions on the market such as capt n proto or bolt
