que,easy,longer
also you might fill the que really easy with the cron which might lead to jobs being executed longer

scheduling,sophisticated
i would suggest scheduling your jobs using something more sophisticated than cron

quartz,scheduler,web,complicated,plumbing
check out the quartz scheduler it does what cron does and more is easily integrated in a web app and allows you to call jobs written in java without any complicated plumbing

idea,new,better,small,load,balancing
edit btw the idea using cron for checking for new jobs to execute is better but only if you have a small website and you don t need to do load balancing for the jobs

job,scheduler
if you can predict more than one cron job to be executed you can try or any other library like this where you can config jobs scheduler in php

better,absolute
btw for cron at jobs is better to use absolute directory pathes not relative
