better, ---------------------------------------------------

better
so using g++ is better than gcc

better
g++ seems to work better than gcc in my experience

others---------------------------------------------------

-e,earlier
gcc -e and g++ -e break even earlier

structs,looser,significant,problems
unfortunately g++ packed the structs significantly looser than gcc which caused significant problems sharing objects between c and c++ code

recognizable,generic
if it matters i m actually concerned with c++ and g++ but i thought gcc would be more recognizable as a generic compiler

afaik,precise,final,linking
afaik it uses g++ to be more precise it uses gcc with language set to c++ and of course g++ for final linking

version,little,larger
the g++ version is a little larger than the gcc version but not 100x larger

compiler,name,parameter,-lstdc++
probably you ll need to set project type as c++ or set compiler name to g++ instead of gcc or add parameter -lstdc++ to command line eclipse uses for build

compiler,strict
g++ compiler is more strict then gcc compiler

wrong,compiler,answer,dan,possible,unusual
outside of calling the wrong compiler using gcc instead of g++ see answer by dan it is possible but unusual to have gcc correctly built but g++ incorrectly built
