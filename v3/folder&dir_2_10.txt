directory, bin, guarantees, ---------------------------------------------------

.svn,bin,directory,longer,source
i did first try deleting the .svn folder from the bin directory but all that did was cause it to complain that the bin dir was no longer under source control and halt

guarantees,name,source,longer,number
there are no guarantees that dir which is the name of a folder within your source dir will be longer in number of chars than the number returned by the randrange

others---------------------------------------------------

objects,fullest,information,older,function,easier
folder objects undoubtedly give the fullest access to file information but the older dir function is easier to use and allows specification of a filename template so i have used that

ideas,command
any ideas how to use the command dir to more than 1 folder in one command

things,cmd,kind,shared,network,thousands,files,ls,slower
things like cmd c dir don t know why - and yes i do cmd c dir in cases i am in some kind of shared network folder with thousands of files and ls is significantly slower than dir

filesystemobject,powerful,string,files,actual,objects
using a filesystemobject is more powerful than dir because dir only returns a string while filesystemobject lets you work with files and folder as actual objects which are much more powerful

issue,subfolders,directory,dir-,actual,longer,chars
i am running into an issue where for some of the folder there are too many subfolders and it spits out the directory name k really long path blah is too long not the actual dir- the actual dir is longer than 260 chars

recent,command,line,4th
it iterates through the most recent folder returned by the dir command each returned on one line and after it encounters the 4th it stops if there are more than 4 folder

size,first,home,platforms,arrayindexoutofboundexception
calculates the size of the first 5 folder in your home dir should work on all platforms fails with an arrayindexoutofboundexception if there are less than five folder in your home dir

project,files,structure,exact,new
i solved this myself the problem was just qt errors no problem with the code at all for some reason it didnt like that my project files were in a folder structure of more than one folder before my project files used the exact same code in a new dir and it worked
