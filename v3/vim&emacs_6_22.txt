everyone, powerful, easier, ---------------------------------------------------

easier,everyone,taste
personally i m using emacs right now which i find easier than vim for searching and navigating the code but everyone has their taste

powerful,easier,keystrokes
i am starting to understand that even though emacs is more powerful than vim vim is at least 10 times easier to use less keystrokes and requires way less modifications

editing, better, external, ---------------------------------------------------

external,editors,better
there are definitely some advantages using external editors however emacs is ten million times better than vim

better,editing,certain
it is worth learning both because emacs is better than vim at editing certain languages and doing certain tasks and vice versa

others---------------------------------------------------

faster
vim was always faster to start up than emacs

out-of-the-box,installs,faster
i m saying that on any machine out-of-the-box installs of vim will start up faster than out-of-the-box installs of emacs

macro,shortcut,f4,easier,qq
for example emacs s macro shortcut f3 and f4 is easier than vim s qq and q

older,extensible,non-extensible,larger
since emacs is much older than the extensible vim as opposed to the relatively non-extensible vi it has a much larger collection of extension modes covering almost any purpose you can imagine

gear,experience,likely,wonky,terminal
on today s machines that s a non-issue but if you ever find yourself dealing with older gear it s my experience that vim is far more likely to work on a wonky terminal than emacs is

keys,important
that said modifier keys are important in vim even if less than in emacs

powerful,engine,flexible,modes,likes
emacs is more powerful than vim it s scripting engine is far more flexible and there are far more scripts modes and the likes built around emacs

difficult,subprocess,separate,idris
in vim it s much more difficult to run a subprocess than it is in emacs so in vim you need to have a separate running idris repl

crowd,thing,emacs-style,thinking,simpler,job
of course the emacs crowd says the same thing regarding emacs-style thinking but i gave up on learning emacs because vim was simpler and did the job for me

amount,customisation,faster
and i tend to think that after a moderate amount of customisation of either one vim will still start up faster than emacs

weeks,great,easier,keyboard,shortcuts
i ve been using emacs for few weeks and it s been great so far - coming from vim was easier than i expected actually - emacs keyboard shortcuts feel more.

slower,ridiculous,fresh
i realized that emacs would load slower than vim but this seems ridiculous for a fresh install

mode,full,access,mind-boggling,complexity
it s an emacs mode that makes emacs feel more like vim while giving you full access to the wonderful mind-boggling complexity of emacs if you ever want it

inbuilt,tutorial,easier,flames,pls
you might want to try emacs - it has an inbuilt tutorial and some people like me find it easier over vim no flames pls

years,area,weaker
i ve used vim for 10+ years but never really into vim scripting always subjectively beliving that this was one area where vim was weaker than emacs

productive,quicker,editing,files,better,things,bindings,equivalent
maybe not productive in the same way - i d say vim is quicker for editing files emacs is better at doing everything else again i would personally say things like flymake-mode vcs bindings are such are quicker to use than the vim equivalent

platform,vi,gui-,text-based,larger,whereas,available,bsd
available on almost every platform true of vi vim too of course - whether gui- or text-based java ides are available on most platforms too but only in gui mode and are significantly larger and need to be installed separately whereas emacs is generally more widely available - bsd nix linux mac systems

cut,steps
cut and paste in vim takes more steps than in emacs iirc
