later,version,easier,actual
or whatever you branched from so the resulting history will appear i started from later version and the merge back will probably be fast-forward it s easier to work with especially since you are rewriting the actual history to logical changesets anyway

feature,branch,morefeaturework,date
if all goes well and people only added stuff on top of your feature branch your suggested merge should only do a fast-forward and keep morefeaturework up to date

qa,functionality,work,master,better,history
qa verifies functionality and approves or disapproves it then i m verifying code and if it is ok i merge his work into master by fast-forward or rebasing for better commits history
