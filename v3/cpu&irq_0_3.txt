run,soft,context,processors,tasklet
cannot sleep run atomically in soft irq context and are guaranteed to never run on more than one cpu of a given processors for a given tasklet

intel,vtune,mhall,cs4961f09,second,logical
ten years ago intel vtune recommended not more than 1000 irq s www.cs.utah.edu mhall cs4961f09 vtune-1.pdf try to get about a 1000 samples per second per logical cpu

process
in some cases irq constitutes more than 8 of cpu for a process
