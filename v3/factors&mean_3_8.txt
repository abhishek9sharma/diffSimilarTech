growth, allocations, smaller, ---------------------------------------------------

growth,larger,golden
if your growth factors is larger than the golden mean that can t happen

smaller,golden,previous,allocations
if the factors is smaller than the golden mean 1.6 and the previous allocations are contiguous with each other they ll eventually add up to a chunk that can satisfy a later requirement

larger,golden
if the factors is larger than the golden mean they never will

others---------------------------------------------------

different,rate,higher,numbers,uglier,picture
try a different rate factors -crf 30 higher numbers mean uglier picture quality but also smaller file size

note,largest,prime,sqrt,greater
note that this does not mean that the largest prime factors is less than sqrt n but that if there is a prime factors greater than sqrt n there is only one such prime factors

possible,big-o,faster,better,constant
additionally the lowest possible big-o doesn t necessarily mean there aren t faster algorithms with better constant factors

zoom,scrollbars,richtextbox,content,visible
the problem is that when the zoom factors is increased to more than 1 the scrollbars are lost on richtextbox but the content is getting edited but not visible i mean the content is below the visible screen once the zoom is set back to normal i can see the content and scroll bars again could you please suggest what i am required to do to get the things right

scale,number,length
you can normalize data that is already normally distributed for example take data for average length of human beings 180 centimeter and scale every number by a factors so that the mean becomes less than 1 multiply every length by 1 180
