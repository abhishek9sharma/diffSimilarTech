components,combobox,available
primefaces has more components but lack combobox available in richfaces

jsf,application,documentation,better
i haven t tried any of these in a jsf 2 application but i would recommend using the primefaces one at least the documentation is better than richfaces

trips,core,earlier,versions,rerender,attribute
one that always trips me up is that core uses render primefaces uses update and earlier versions of richfaces used rerender as the attribute to specify which other elements were the target of the ajax response

developed,rf
richfaces is more developed and tested generally since primefaces came out later than rf
