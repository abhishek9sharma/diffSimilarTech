suspect,semantics,appropriate,employee.team
i d also add that i suspect set semantics instead of bag would be more appropriate for the employee.team and team.employee properties

actual,details,thread,knapsack,algorithm,value
returning the actual set is explained with more details in the thread how to find which elements are in the bag using knapsack algorithm and not only the bag s value

disabled,useful,fetchmode.subselect
take into account that lazy mappings will be disabled so it may be useful to evaluate what will be need to be set to fetchtype.eager with fetchmode.subselect if more than 1 bag is needed to be initialized with it

inverse,item,faster,uniqueness
the inverse is adding an item to a bag can be faster than using a set because uniqueness does not have to be enforced
