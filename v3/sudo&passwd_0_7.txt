command,older,normal,procedure,user
as a note the su command is much older than sudo and the normal procedure before sudo was to su to root and then to another user unless you knew the passwd of that other user

suggestion,comments,server,declaration,cleaner,solution
thanks to a suggestion in the comments i removed the passwd from the server declaration since i think getting sudo to work without a passwd is a cleaner solution anyway

complex
automating sudo is slighly more complex if you need to pass the passwd but still can be done

fewer,keystrokes,need
of course this is no fewer keystrokes than sudo python although at least you wouldn t need to enter a passwd

better,respects,asroot
sudo is better in most respects but still requires a passwd which asroot does not

wrappers,harder,some-command,|,othercommand,work
this is partly to make passwd stealing wrappers harder but is mostly useful so that things like some-command | sudo othercommand work even if sudo has to prompt for a passwd

root,account,better,method
you can enable the root account and set a passwd but jumping to it with sudo is the better method
