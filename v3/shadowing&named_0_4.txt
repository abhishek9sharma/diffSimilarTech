reasoning,parameters,nicer,member,variables
i believe the reasoning behind it is that it allows the parameters to be named nicer by preventing shadowing of member variables

flexible,object,changes
when you re not worrying about shadowing this is more flexible if the named of the object changes

common,practice,confusion
not using the same named is a more common practice to avoid confusion and shadowing

variable,strlen,standard,function,little,confusing
note that naming a local variable strlen thus shadowing the standard function of that named is going to more than a little confusing for someone who looks at your code later
