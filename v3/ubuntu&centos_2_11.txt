versions, libraries, rhel, ---------------------------------------------------

system,newer,libraries
this is because your ubuntu system has newer system libraries than your centos one

newer,rhel,compilers,versions
newer rhel centos have newer compilers but i d actually recommend ubuntu s lts versions

others---------------------------------------------------

nature,conservative,support,fedora,better,options
centos by its nature is quite a conservative distro - so if you are after the latest codecs media support then fedora or ubuntu may be better options

obvious,sfphpview-,render,run,slower
is there anything obvious in ubuntu that would otherwise be making sfphpview- render run slower than centos

better,easier,setup
i believe that ubuntu is better than centos when it comes to mono as it is much easier to setup and seems to be better supported

particular,amazon,linux,things,worse,long
also very particular that this should be done on centos or amazon linux which makes things worse for me as i have been on ubuntu for long

default
i don t know if it s activated by default on centos but it might be considering it is on ubuntu which is less entreprise oriented

dnf,zint,work
on centos dnf install zint ubuntu takes more work

consistent,reliable,enterprise,desktops,personal
centos is more consistent and reliable because it is enterprise while ubuntu is geared towards desktops and personal computers

fuser,-n,linux,distro,report,process
one one ubuntu distro fuser -n tcp 3000 will report a process if i own the process yet on another linux distro i think centos it won t report the process even if i own it

respect,desirable,server,rhel,mature,versions
in this respect ubuntu is less desirable on a server than rhel or centos which stick to more mature versions
