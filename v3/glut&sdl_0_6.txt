demo,mechanism,better,care,details
if you re building a simple demo of a rendering mechanism glut is way better than sdl it takes care of a lot of the details that sdl would otherwise require

better
i have never used glut but i know that many people will say sdl is better

control,main
recently i migrated over to sdl from glut to get more control over the main loop

serious,application,likely,tool,abstracts,real
however if you re developing a serious application sdl is more likely to be the tool you need to use as glut abstracts more than a real application would normally want to

example,examples,repo,older,fixed-function
unfortunately there is no shader driven opengl example that i can refer to the provided examples on the glut repo and sdl only use older fixed-function rendering and don t use any shaders that i can see

easier,sfml,flexible,feature-full
glut is much more easier while many of people use sdl or sfml they re more flexible and feature-full than glut
