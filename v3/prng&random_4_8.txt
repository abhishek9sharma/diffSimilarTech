reflection, structure, good, ---------------------------------------------------

non-random,behaviour,reflection,quality,rand,good
the non-random random behaviour is more a reflection on the quality of the rand prng Ã¢ it is often not very good

seed,good,non-cryptographic,output,structure
then you use it as seed in random which is less good that one is a non-cryptographic prng and its output may exhibit some structure which will not register in a statistical measurement tool but might be exploited by an intelligent attacker

pseudorandom, numbers, source, ---------------------------------------------------

usage,seed,numbers
would it maybe be wise to use this somewhat dynamic memory usage as a seed for a prng to generate more quickly random numbers

seed,source,numbers,pseudorandom
if you seed a prng from a truly random source and then just keep calling the prng to get more numbers then you will just have a pseudorandom sequence of numbers albeit well seeded

others---------------------------------------------------

dev,entropy,indiv,comments,seed,seeds
to avoid having to do so many reads from dev random which can run out of entropy you can instead do as indiv suggested in the comments seed a prng to generate more seeds

article,gamma,variables,sophisticated,generating,methods,multiple,calls
however the wikipedia article on gamma random variables suggest that more sophisticated methods are used in generating gamma random variables methods which involve multiple calls to the underlying prng

proper,faster,division,trade-off,performance,source
a proper prng should be much faster than division on big integers so this should be a better trade-off -- but this really depends on the performance of the random source and since it is a question of performance it cannot be fully answered without trying

large,period,memory,internal,state,time,number,complex
but a large period prng takes up more memory for maintaining the internal state and also takes more time for generating a random number due to complex transitions and post processing
