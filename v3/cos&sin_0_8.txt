cheaper,sqrt,1-sin
if i want to calculate a sin and a cos is it cheaper to calculate a sin and a cos or calculate a sin then a sqrt 1-sin 2 to get the cos

small,values,integer,value,larger
your conversion function results in very small values which for sin may not change the integer value of y and for cos result in larger values for x

machine,faster
or maybe flip them on my machine sin seems faster than cos

taylor,expansions,x,longer
the taylor expansions of sin x and cos x takes longer to converge as x increases

smaller,pi,bigger,little
3.14 is pretty close but a little smaller than pi and sin 3.14 is thus pretty close but a little bigger than 0 cos 3.14 is thus pretty close but a little smaller in absolute terms than -1 so tan 3.14 is a little less than 0

tick,better,distinction,sign
cos itself seems to be consistently a tick 0 01 better than sin but the case distinction to reconstruct the sign has an extra test

closer
in this case sin will be much closer to 1 and cos much closer to 0

computing,theta,matrix,addition,faster,power,series
this requires computing cos theta and sin theta just once and then each update is given by a matrix multiplication of a 2x2 matrix with a 2-d vector and then a simple addition which is faster than computing sin using the power series expansion
