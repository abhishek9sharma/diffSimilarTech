everyone, focusout, validation, ---------------------------------------------------

everyone,better,validation
also i am not sure why everyone is suggesting onblur isn t onchange is better for validation purpose

better,focusout,blur
onchange is a better choice than onblur or focusout because blur and focusout also fire when the contents of the text field hasn t changed

others---------------------------------------------------

work,onkeyup,sane
also onchange won t work you ll need to use onkeyup although onblur is probably more sane

focus,imo,event,appropriate,onblure
edit you probably only want to validate when the value changes and field loses focus that s why imo the onchange event would be more appropriate than onblur not onblure
