sort, error, use, ---------------------------------------------------

supply,better,error
if you didn t implement comparable and didn t supply a comparator it is much better to error out than to just silently sort your list in semi-random order

class,better,use
a comparator class is better since use of comparable would mean using

standard,sort,rows,better
that said using a standard sort with either comparable rows or a comparator is much better than mixing up the sort logic and the comparison logic

others---------------------------------------------------

solution,cleaner,dto,needs
this solution is cleaner than implementing comparable by your dto because you can create and use many comparator acording to your needs

logic,flexibility,order
using comparator instead of putting all the logic directly in the comparable gives you more flexibility in the order that things are compared in

appropriate,latter,natural
your case sounds like one where creating a comparator would be more appropriate than implementing comparable the latter is specifically for modelling a natural order of instances of the class

conceptual,sense,comparison,operator,logic,greater,lesser
in conceptual sense a comparator is the comparison operator the logic used to determine whether a comparable is greater lesser than another comparable


comparator does everything that comparable does plus more

string,達続,equal
very comparable as a string comparator that accepts o and o and 達続 to be equal

keyfn,return,value,requirements,easier
using just the keyfn return a comparable value that matches your requirements is much easier than implementing comparator
