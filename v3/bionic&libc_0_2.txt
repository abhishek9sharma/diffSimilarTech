android,version,limited
bionic the android version of libc is more slightly more limited not by much

standard,ndk,toolchain
unless you particularly need to build against a more standard libc than bionic you can just use the ndk s toolchain either by copying the hello-jni example and changing build_shared_library to build_executable in the jni android.mk or using the script to generate a stand alone toolchain
