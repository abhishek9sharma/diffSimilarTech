requirement, single, variant, ---------------------------------------------------

requirement,slower,bytes
there is no requirement that fgetc be any slower at retrieving a block of bytes than fread

things,successive,slower,single,bytes
doing things like 1000 successive fgetc is much slower than doing one single fread of 1000 bytes

loop,variant,slower
the fgetc loop variant was consistently 45x slower than the fread loop

others---------------------------------------------------

version,simpler
you might have even noticed the fgetc version is simpler than the fread version
