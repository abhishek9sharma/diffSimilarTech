execution, better, quicker, ---------------------------------------------------

statements,database,consecutive,calls,method,faster
prepare statements are sent to the database which checks it for errors and also optimizes it so that consecutive calls to the execute method are performed faster

solution,statement,possible,sql,query,safer,alternative
using a solution such as a prepare statement where it is not possible for a user to directly influence the actual sql query being execute is a safer alternative

executemany,better,statement
2 executemany is better than execute as it makes for you the prepare statement

sql,statement,statements,better
yes if one sql statement is execute repeatedly using prepare statements is much better

performance,statements,quicker,practice,infrequent
performance occasionally - it is true that prepare statements are vastly quicker when execute many times but in practice this is very infrequent

statements,faster,sql,parameters
prepare statements are much faster if you execute the same sql and just change parameters in it

statement,sooner,later
any execute statement becomes prepare sooner or later it need to be parsed optimized compiled and then execute

execution,faster,statements,statement,time
prepare execution is faster than direct execution for statements execute more than three or four times because the statement is compiled only once while statements execute directly are compiled each time they are execute

handy,able,statement,shot,query,better
this would be so much handy to be able to send execute statement in one shot as the prepare query are way better in term of security if i go with the query method i will have to escape manually my parameters...

wrong,statements,faster,rdbms,parameters
if i didn t get it wrong prepare statements are faster because they are sent only the first time to the rdbms and then only the parameters are sent when it needs to be execute

statement
my question is how can i execute more than 1 prepare statement

statements,faster
prepare statements are faster to execute if used repeatedly

statements,faster,mysql,server
prepare statements are slightly faster when execute repeatedly because the mysql server has to parse the sql and run the query planner optimizer only once

tokens, values, greater, ---------------------------------------------------

parameters,pdo,greater,number,tokens,statement
is there a way to allow the number of parameters passed thru pdo execute to be greater than the number of tokens identified in the prepare statement

answer,variables,security,values,pdo,array,bind
i ve updated the answer to use bind variables so that using prepare will give you more security and then you can either bind the values or using pdo execute with the array of bind values

others---------------------------------------------------

queries,efficient,query,multiple
prepare queries are more efficient when you execute a query multiple times and also obviate the need to sanitize user input

adequate,handling,better
this is adequate but as mentioned - prepare and - execute handling are better

manipulations,result,statement,text
so the solution you have come up with is correct if you want to mess with the statement text between invocation then by all means use client-side text manipulations 1 but do not attempt to use the result of it as a prepare statement unless you really intend to execute the resulting text more than once

shows,bench,slower,intensive,values,doc,query,multiple
searching around shows many people bench marking prepare as being much slower and more intensive than the using execute especially when you aren t expecting any values back also see the doc for prepare - it notes being designed to optimize calling the same query multiple times

statements,free,performances,queries,pre-,engine,efficient
prepare statements offer for free a more reliable and secure dynamic parameter binding which is what you want and also better performances especially with recurring queries because prepare statements are pre- compiled by the database engine and much more efficient to execute
