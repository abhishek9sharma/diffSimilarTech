bytes, first, last, ---------------------------------------------------

greater,last,argument
this is the case here because strlen hello is greater than 3 your last strncpy argument

source,greater,first,bytes
however if strlen source is greater than n then strncpy will simply copy the first n bytes and will not terminate the string dest with a null byte because there is no space for it

others---------------------------------------------------

matter,initial,safety,slower,check
but for the example you give it doesn t matter - if it s going to fail it will be in the initial strlen so strncpy doesn t buy you anything in terms of safety and presumbly strncpy is slower as it has to both check bounds and for nul and any difference between memcpy and strcpy isn t worth changing code for speculatively
