fine,better,idea,background,process
and it seems working fine antialiasing is much better however this beats the idea of a transparent background in the process

pixels
minus doesn t truly work for antialiasing less than 100 transparent pixels

rectangles,images,vertices,edge,primitives,edges
primitives such as rectangles and images will be antialiasing by adding more vertices along the edge of the primitives so that the edges fade to transparent
