google,proposal,efficient,wire,protocol,semantics,request
spdy a google initiated proposal to extend http using a more efficient wire protocol but maintaining all http semantics request response cookies encoding

equivalent,implementation,detail
anything that you do with http is more or less equivalent with spdy and neither is really anything but an implementation detail of your soa work

optimizations,tls-secured,connection,better,plain
in fact with optimizations like spdy you might find that a tls-secured connection actually performs better than plain http

efficient,protocol
spdy is a more efficient protocol than http

better,article,use
http 2 is even better than spdy and check this article for a use case regarding spdy
