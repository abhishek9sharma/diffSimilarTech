available, malloc, faster, ---------------------------------------------------

faster,malloc,available
tcmalloc is faster than the glibc 2.3 malloc available as a separate library called ptmalloc2 and other malloc s that i have tested

faster,malloc.
tcmalloc is faster than the glibc 2.3 malloc.

others---------------------------------------------------

jemalloc,setting,changes,aggressive,memory,os
jemalloc and tcmalloc with some setting changes can be more aggressive than glibc to release memory to the os - but again it depends on the allocation patterns

issue,increase,rate
then we found glibc also have same issue but increase rate is less than tcmalloc
