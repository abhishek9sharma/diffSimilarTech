patch, performance, stuff, ---------------------------------------------------

patch,objects,patches,3d,easier,better
you could do this in matplotlib probably using patch objects to build up a cube and colour the patches as needed however for 3d plotting mayavi is generally easier better

past,performance,better,3d,scatter
personally i ve used mayavi in the past and found the performance much better than matplotlib for 3d scatter plotting though the python bindings are somewhat in question moving forward i think

3d,stuff,better
anyway if you re willing to do advanced 3d stuff mayavi is way better than matplotlib

others---------------------------------------------------

easier,data,professional
mayavi makes it easier to visualize the data but matplotlib looks more professional

options,camera,axis,complex
mayavi has more options for moving the camera than matplotlib but it doesn t seem to have a way to rotate around the y axis so i m guessing i ll need to perform some complex calculations on the azimuth and elevation to achieve the same result - but i m at a loss as to where to start i m new to working in 3d space and my brain doesn t think that way yet

better
mayavi might be better but i haven t tried this as i wanted to stick with matplotlib
