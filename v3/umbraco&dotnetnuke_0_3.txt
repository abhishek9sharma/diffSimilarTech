good,result,cms,lean,user,friendly
i also had good result with umbraco cms it s a bit more lean than dotnetnuke but not as user friendly and definitely not as popular

bigger,market,competition,smaller,modules
while dotnetnuke is a much bigger market it seems to be crowded with a lot of competition versus umbraco which is smaller but it looks like it lacks modules in certain categories

architecture,better
consider umbraco its architecture is definitely better than dotnetnuke s
