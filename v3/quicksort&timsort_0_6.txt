better,best,worst
i ve read that timsort is better than quicksort both in the best and the worst case although it uses a bit more memory

look,non,random,data,better,asymptotic,complexity,lower,constants
you can take a look at timsort which for non completely random data performs better than quicksort they have the same asymptotic complexity but timsort has lower constants

comparison,real,life
if it is true then timsort will always take less comparison than quicksort because on real life data there is some pattern except data is truly random

sort,worse,kinds,data,advantageous
this means that while the two underlying sorts it uses mergesort and insertion sort are both worse than quicksort for many kinds of data timsort only uses them when it is advantageous to do so

array,.sort,fastest,general,#sort,better,situations
java s array .sort is from about java 6 actually timsort the fastest general purpose #sort out there much better than quicksort in many situations

faster
if that is so you might find that timsort runs faster than quicksort
