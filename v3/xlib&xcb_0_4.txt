alternative,better,non-blocking
the xcb library is alternative to xlib which is much better all around and supports a non-blocking interface but it doesn t play well with opengl

simpler,better,environment,documentation,dated,complex
xcb is simpler to use has a better response to a multithread environment but lacks documentation while xlib is a more dated complex tool better documented and fully implemented

lower,level,number,round-trips
xcb is lower level than xlib and allows you to minimise the number of round-trips to the x server leading to lower latency

direct,view,protocol,specs,source
xcb presents a more direct view of the protocol than xlib does so you often have to look at either the protocol specs or xlib source code to find out what the underlying protocol request is to find an equivalent
