thing, simplications, better, ---------------------------------------------------

better
svn is better than cvs

better,thing,simplications
svn is better than cvs because it was designed to be - it s roughly the same thing with some simplications and new features

respect, new, project, ---------------------------------------------------

better,respect,new,project
that being said i think svn is better in every other respect and you probably shouldn t start a new project with cvs

better,mature,tools
svn in much better than cvs and have lot of mature tools for every platform

better,areas,work
svn was supposed to be better than cvs but in some areas that didn t work well

okay,binary,files,better
if you use svn then it still okay because svn handles binary files much better than cvs

git, mercurial, downvote, ---------------------------------------------------

better,git,mercurial
svn is much better then cvs and git or mercurial are even better again

downvote,readers,better,system,git
i can only guess at the reasons and i don t worry much about the occasional downvote but perhaps some readers think i m advocating cvs as a better system than svn or git

other---------------------------------------------------

comment,better,enviroment,vss,weird
for all the reasons linked in the comment and elsewhere svn tends to be a much better enviroment than cvs or vss unless you have some weird requirements - so if you can successfully import your history and save the company money i wouldn t see why the bosses wouldn t go for it

file,size,time,smaller,compression,web,bigger
in this case i converted the cvs to svn and found the file size on the hard drive it was on my own laptop at the time but it was much smaller in svn than in cvs but there could have been some compression applied i dont know but everything on the web said svn would actually be bigger than cvs

tools,faster,slow,hell,useful,features,new,feature,years
the other distributed tools are a lot faster svn is slow as hell even cvs can be faster sometimes have much more useful features than svn are developing rapidly while seeing any new feature in svn takes years

first,+ssh,comparable,format,protocol
the first one can be solved by using svn +ssh which is the more comparable format as cvs uses its own protocol as well

addition,coworker,popular
in addition another coworker said cvs was a lot more popular than svn

part,point,use,branches,easier
part of the point of svn was to make the use of branches and merging much easier than in cvs

disk,space
wondering mainly if svn uses less disk space or more than the same in cvs

stores,binaries,efficient,info,svn-faq
in fact svn does stores binaries a lot more efficient than cvs for more info see the svn-faq
