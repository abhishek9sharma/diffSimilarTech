error, message, paint, ---------------------------------------------------

better,error,message
safari behaves better than firefox but an error message â œone error in opening the pageâ â shows up in the status bar if you remove the iframe during the load event

paint,scroll,worse,better
i planned on using svgs for the entire site but with only 20-30 svg images of medium to high complexity used in the page and google-chrome already seems to be showing som jank and high paint times for scroll and firefox is even worse though safari seems to do a lot better

beta, trial, conversion, ---------------------------------------------------

beta,trial,conversion,better
the service is still in beta trial and firefox conversion is working better than safari one

better,web,development
firefox is just better for web development and i prefer safari overall

other---------------------------------------------------

so to specify firefox greater than 20 safari greater than 9.1 and ie greater than 9

closer,bottom
in ie and firefox fullscreen_block appears closer to the bottom than in safari and google-chrome

in safari it renders significantly brighter than in firefox or google-chrome

geolocation,iphone,os,result,interesting,accurate
i just tested geolocation on firefox 3.6 and iphone safari os 3.1.3 the result is interesting firefox is more accurate than safari

current,use,macos,anti-alisaing,new,feature
in particular a font may be rendered quite differently between the various browsers and operating systems in current use - safari and macos use more anti-alisaing than firefox or ie but ie9 has a new feature called cleartype which also affects font rendering

several,pixels,higher,lower
in safari it is several pixels higher up than in firefox and google-chrome and significantly lower in opera

test,problems
please especially test on safari because it has some more problems than firefox and google-chrome

slower,object,property
on safari everything is slower than on firefox still the object property access is more than two times faster

discrepancy,text,element,taller,slight,amount,whitespace,top
i saw that the discrepancy was because in safari the text element is taller than in firefox and includes a slight amount of whitespace on top that doesn t show up in firefox in firefox the top of the text element is exactly when the text starts

mac,faster,pc,newer
google-chrome or safari on a mac could be much faster than firefox on a pc especially with newer apis

small,smaller
small in firefox is smaller then small in safari so never ever use them

font,sharp,ie8,good,fuzzy
font looks sharp in google-chrome safari ie8 not as good as other 2 but less fuzzy than firefox

sloppy,forgiving
but i haven t yet figured out whether it s me writing sloppy code with firefox perhaps being more forgiving than safari or if it s safari or if it s jquery

strict
it seems that ie and firefox are less strict than safari

right,text,middle
to me it looks like safari gets it more right than firefox text is generally more around a middle line

internet,explorer,strict,security
it seems that google-chrome internet explorer or safari are more strict than firefox on terms of security

great,worse
it works great in google-chrome and safari haven t tested ie but i m sure it s somehow worse than firefox

products,contact,1px,margin,bigger
that i gave to every link in the set of links home about us products contact and it seems that firefox is making that 1px margin much bigger than safari or google-chrome and distorting it

dom,level,faster
in safari we found that the dom level 0 took twice the time off the dom level 2 but was still four times faster than either firefox case
