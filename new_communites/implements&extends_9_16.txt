idea, runable, preferrable, ---------------------------------------------------

runnable,better,thread,idea
i have read that implements runnable is better than extends thread but i have no idea of how

runable,better,thread
i also know implements runable is better than extends thread

runnable,better
implements runnable is better because you can extends other classes

runnable,preferrable,thread
they say that implements runnable is more preferrable than extends thread

class, interface, system, ---------------------------------------------------

runnable,better,thread,class
why is implements runnable a better option than extends from thread class

interface,better,system,superclass
i have not found a lot of times when implements an interface would be a better system than extends a superclass

sense,class,higher,priority,interface
which i think makes sense because extends from a class should take higher priority than implements from an interface

easier, value, listview, ---------------------------------------------------

value,listview,arrayadapter,easier,baseadapter
second in order to add or update the value of listview in general extends arrayadapter is much easier than implements baseadapter because of arrayadapter support add remove insert method by itself

note,mouseadapter,easier,methods
note extends mouseadapter is easier since you only need to implements the methods you want to handle

other---------------------------------------------------

larger,errors
implements gives larger errors because i tried with extends

api,external,better,position,oauth,doorkeeper
but if you d like to extends this api to be used by the external services then you ll be in a much better position with implements oauth 2.0 using doorkeeper because you can easily configure for example a authorization code grant for them

sense,typo,book
extends makes more sense to me here than implements maybe it s a typo in the book

rawcomparator,faster,writablecomparator
is implements the rawcomparator that much faster than extends writablecomparator

solutions,available,asp.net,identity,better,custom,solution
are there some solutions available to extends asp.net identity better than implements a custom solution as suggested in the links

possible,stronger,relationship,type,relationships
a possible reason is that extends represents a a stronger relationship than implements although both represent is a or is a type of relationships

thing,answer,gridviewpager
more or less the same thing as the accepted answer can be implements more succinctly by extends the gridviewpager like this
