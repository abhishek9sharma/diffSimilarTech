better, higher, oracle, ---------------------------------------------------

application,better
it is said that if you have a mostly read based application you should use myisam as it is better than innodb

better
this is one way in which innodb is sometimes better than myisam

updates,better
since you don t do updates i think myisam would be better than innodb in this scenario

select,today,better
you insert in there but never select from there as far as i know today myisam is better than innodb in this case

application,better
so for such an application is it will innodb be a better choice over myisam

interviews,benefits,better
sometimes i got asked on some interviews what benefits does innodb have against myisam and when myisam is better than innodb

better,read-oriented,tables
i have heard that myisam performs better than innodb on read-oriented tables

better
but when myisam is really better than innodb

better,advanced,features
myisam is better than innodb when you don t need those advanced features and storage speed is more important than other concerns

better
innodb when tuned well performs better than myisam

better,inadecuate
finally even if somehow you could manage myisam to perform better than innodb that doesn t mean innodb is inadecuate at all

oracle,better
in fact oracle is so sure that innodb is better that they removed myisam from 8.0

better
almost always innodb is a better choice than myisam

someone,better
someone just told me that innodb is much better than myisam

better,handling,bulk
you can also try using innodb since it s said is better than myisam handling bulk inserts with data already on it

better,old,engine
innodb is a better choice as myisam is really old engine and would fade away in near future

documents,updates,better
in many discussions and even in mysql documents it has been mentioned that in case of updates innodb performs much better than myisam

better,high-write,table
innodb would be a better choice than myisam for a high-write table

oracle,better,situations
oracle has kept improving innodb by so much that they declare that it is better than myisam in virtually all situations

scales,better
innodb scales better than myisam

better
since myisam is better on selecting while innodb is better on writing

certain,better
but in certain scenarios myisam works better than innodb

better
mostly innodb is better choice than a myisam

mysql,engines,better
1 in mysql engines myisam is better or innodb

area,buffer,better,job
in this area i think innodb s change buffer does a better job than myisam s do it now

better,high,read,volumes
myisam is better for high read volumes innodb for high update volumes due to table vs row locking

better,performance,acid,transactions
i currently have myisam and i would like to stay with it because it had far better performance than innodb in my case but i heard that innodb has acid transactions

better,crash,recovery,poor
innodb has better crash recovery while myisam is poor at recovering

right,better,frequent,updates,inserts
am i right that innodb is better for frequent concurrent updates and inserts than myisam

conclusion,higher,performance,average
their conclusion innodb has 30 higher performance than myisam on average

better,read,performance,cost,acid
myisam delivers better read performance compared to innodb at the cost of being less acid compliant

higher,levels,concurrency,better
therefore innodb can handle higher levels of concurrency better than myisam

type,system,sensible,contention,different
for an oltp type system innodb is usually more sensible than myisam did you check the contention before trying a different engine

harder,knobs,system,higher,throughput,better
innodb is harder to tune since it has more knobs but a properly tuned innodb system can often have higher throughput than myisam due to better locking and better i o patterns

higher,throughput
innodb delivered 4.6x higher throughput than myisam while achieving

higher,resource,consumption,rates,mind
innodb has a higher resource consumption rates then myisam so keep that in mind

faster, speed, slower, ---------------------------------------------------

faster,application,mix
innodb is actually faster than myisam in quite a few cases so it depends on what your application s mix of selects updates concurrent queries indexes buffer configuration etc

mysql,version,faster
also mysql version starting from 5.5 - innodb performs faster than myisam

faster,benchmarks
innodb not only has the advantages you list but it is also faster than myisam in many benchmarks

after testing it seems that myisam is faster than innodb when using when there is no where clause

faster,fulltext,index
myisam is slightly faster than innodb and implements the fulltext index which is quite useful for integrating search capabilities

faster,types,queries
myisam is not faster than innodb anymore for most types of queries

faster,worth,lack
ok there are some cases where myisam is faster than innodb but rarely enough that it s worth putting up with the lack of acid-compliance

trope,faster,holdover,current
the trope about myisam being faster than innodb is a holdover from code that was current in the mid-2000 s

faster,safe,production
myisam is often faster than innodb but isn t safe to use in a production environment for critical data

faster,use,transactions
myisam is faster but does not support the use of transactions like innodb does

speed,faster
speed does matter here myisam is still slightly faster than innodb especially for reads

pure,speed,faster
in terms of pure speed it is not always the case that myisam is faster than innodb but in my experience it tends to be faster for pure read working environments by a factor of about 2.0-2.5 times

faster,concurrent,updates
we know that myisam is faster than innodb when we don t have many concurrent updates inserts

response,boss,faster
now the response i got from my boss is that i need to prove that innodb will run faster than myisam

literature,better,faster,old
most of the literature that says myisam is better faster whatever then innodb is old literature

faster,abit
i heard myisam is faster but others say innodb can be fast also but it takes abit more to optimize it

perfect,database,reading,faster
myisam is the perfect choice since the database is almost only used for reading and myisam is significantly faster that innodb

faster,myth
myisam is faster than innodb for reads myth

beststat,row-level,inserts-updates,faster
beststat is innodb so i have row-level locking and consindering i do a lot of inserts-updates it should be faster than myisam

slower,uses,faster
innodb is slower than myisam for most uses but can perform faster in certain conditions due to a better locking mechanism

past,years,today,faster
but innodb has improved dramatically in the past few years and in most cases today innodb performs faster than myisam

script,indexes,products,faster
the script was tested using myisam and it indexes products relatively fast much much faster than innodb

time,faster,acceptable,environment
myisam is almost 4 time faster than innodb which is not acceptable in the environment we are working as i mentioned earlier that every second is worth many dollers for us

faster,marginal
innodb seems slightly faster than myisam but this is really marginal

engines,faster,expense,lack
also note that some mysql engines are faster than others for example myisam may run faster than innodb at expense of the lack of real foreign keys

benchmarks,faster,little,improvement
in some benchmarks i see that myisam is faster than innodb but seems i have a little improvement

faster,recent,improvements,difference
some people have said that for reads myisam is faster but recent improvements in innodb have either alleviated or eradicated this difference

faster,simpler
edited to add myisam is faster than innodb because it is simpler

time,table,faster
with innodb there is less time lost from table locking while myisam is faster in table readings

wives,tale,faster
yes it is an old wives tale that myisam is faster than innodb

core,tables,faster
note however that for high traffic websites we do modify the joomla core and we also switch the tables from innodb to myisam regardless what others might think here myisam is much faster than innodb

thread,faster
in a thread i came to know that myisam is faster for reads innodb is faster for writes

faster,raw,performance
myisam is often faster than innodb in terms of raw performance mostly because it is not acid

faster
in general is myisam faster than innodb

complex,simpler
innodb is more complex while myisam is simpler

faster
myisam has proved to be faster than innodb for me

faster
you are right because myisam is really faster than innodb

faster
i am not sure if this is no longer true myisam is faster than innodb for reads

faster
myisam for reads may well be faster than innodb

faster,recent,versions,smaller,set
myisam has historically been viewed as faster than innodb but for recent versions of innodb that is true for a much much smaller set of use cases

slower,atomic
generally speaking innodb is slower than myisam as innodb is atomic while myisam is not

slower,count
after all innodb shouldn t be slower than myisam when using count + where but that s exactly what is happening here

plain,wrong,faster
it is a massive over simplification in some cases and plain wrong in others to say we know that myisam is faster than innodb

slower
why is innodb so much slower than myisam in my case

slower
innodb is slower than myisam but in which cases

concensus,areas,faster
in general it seems as though the concensus is to primarily use innodb but there are still some areas in which myisam is much faster than innodb

slower
however innodb tends to be slower as myisam

slower
innodb shouldn t be much slower than myisam

opinion,use,faster,speed
in my opinion myisam use to be faster than innodb now they are pretty much the same in speed

heavier
i know innodb is heavier than myisam but just how much more

concurrent,row-level
innodb is more concurrent than myisam since it provides row-level locking

data, better, faster, ---------------------------------------------------

table,faster,rollback,possible
myisam table is much faster than innodb but no rollback is possible

faster,query,level,lock
myisam is faster when the query is simple but it s much slower in a high concurrent environment as its table level lock comparing to innodb s row level lock

inserts,faster,data,later
myisam inserts are going to be faster than innodb so if you re logging data and retrieving it later that will be a win

table,type,faster,overhead
if you are not using transactions while storing or updating tables switch table type to myisam its quite faster than innodb with much less overhead

use,faster,data,base
use myisam usually much faster than innodb if your data base isnt transaction oriented

better,concurrency,contexts,faster
have you considered changing to innodb - it has much better concurrency support and in some contexts will run faster than myisam

faster,whole,table,throughput
myisam is much faster for reads but since it locks the whole table for writes this is where overall throughput drops compared with innodb

tables,smaller,better,data,integrity
you can also use compression on the tables to keep them smaller but innodb is vastly better than myisam at data integrity

memory,actual,data,files,larger
myisam uses less memory than innodb and the actual data files are often quite a bit larger for innodb

better,semantics,data,integrity,performance,targets
innodb supports better locking semantics so if there will be occasional or frequent writes or if you want better data integrity i d suggest starting there and then benchmarking myisam later if you can t hit your performance targets

situations,efficient,large,data
there are some situations when myisam is infinitely more efficient than innodb when manipulating large data dumps offline because of table lock

database,large,buffer,pool,small,performance,better
if your database has a large innodb buffer pool and a small key buffer then innodb performance is going to be better than myisam performance especially for large tables

engine,faster,large,data,counting,better,safe
the engine is myisam i ve heard people recommend switching to innodb but many others said myisam is faster with large amounts of data in terms of counting and innodb better for safe transactions

strict,data,integrity
innodb is more strict in data integrity while myisam is not as

strict,data,integrity,loose
innodb is more strict in data integrity while myisam is loose

better,data,integrity,matter,engine
generally innodb is much better for preserving your data integrity so stick with it and do not go back to myisam there is also a matter of what each engine is best fore but unless you give us more details there is no point in dwelling on that

data,space
myisam also tends to store data in less space than innodb

safer,acid,engine,integrity
innodb is a safer acid compliant engine with some integrity features that myisam lacks

susceptible,data,corruption,better
myisam is more susceptible to data corruption than innodb and usually innodb performs better because it caches both data and indexes

effecient,primary,data
innodb -- more effecient than myisam because of the way the primary key is clustered with the data in innodb

table,engine,large,number,records,faster,data,contrary,indexes
if you have so many records in the table then the first thing is to change the table engine to innodb if its not innodb because for large number of records innodb is much faster as it caches the table data while on the contrary myisam engine only caches the indexes so each time it has to do a full table scan from disk if the data required cannot be fetched from index

modifications,data,faster,row,table
if there are many modifications of the data it s said that innodb works faster because it uses row locking instead of table locking like myisam

orders,better,transaction,feature,order,table,faster,full-text,rollback,wrong
i am creating an commerce website and i am stuck in a database problem i am storing customer orders please tell me which is better myisam or innodb i have to use transaction like feature in customer order table and i personally prefer myisam because it is much faster than innodb and it also supports full-text searching is there any way to use transaction like rollback feature in myisam so that if anything goes wrong table will be rollback to its previous state how to do that without any external library or any other server side access and i have to use mysql

new,table,insert,gb,excess,stuff,data,larger
put another way let s say i start with a new innodb table and insert 20 gb of data assuming that 20 gb incorporates all the excess innodb stuff i realize data stored in innodb is larger than myisam then i delete all data then i insert 10 gb of data

performance,reading,tables,count,index,clauses,table,slower
generally you can have as good performance for reading as in myisam in innodb tables - you just can use count without where clause and you always should have a suitable index for where clauses as in innodb table scan will be slower than in myisam

table,engine,better,full,text
also i can t see your table engine but myisam is better for full text searching rather than innodb

better,crash,recovery,poor,data
innodb has better crash recovery while myisam is poor at recovering data integrity at system crashes

nothing,safe,safer,data,loss
nothing is 100 safe but innodb properly used is a lot safer than myisam against data loss and corruption

anyone,faster,tuning,small,data
anyone who thinks myisam is faster is either not tuning innodb correctly or has such small data that who cares

row,level,table,crash,revovery,better
innodb uses row level locking while myisam can only use table level locking that is why innodb has crash revovery is better than myisam

performance,boost,quicker,fulltext,mysql
this is a huge performance boost look like myisam is much more quicker for fulltext in mysql than innodb

database,performance,necessary,faster,engine
database performance of the innodb is not necessary faster than the myisam engine

versions,mysql,features,available,fulltext,geospatial,indexing,performance,better
newer versions of mysql 5.5+ have extended innodb to support all the features that were previously only available on myisam such as fulltext and geospatial indexing and innodb performance is usually considerably better than myisam when configured properly

data,mysql,higher,performance,transactions,faster,reliable
out of experience i m involved to a project that uses huge amount of data using mysql and we mostly prefer myisam for data that can be generated it allows to achieve much higher performance losing transactions but generally speaking myisam is faster but innodb is more reliable

general,rule,quicker,table,growth
there are other optimizations available but general rule is that innodb will be quicker than myisam is even with table growth

resistant,table,corruption
innodb is more resistant to table corruption than myisam

faster,certain,functions,rollback...,table
myisam generally performs faster because it lacks certain functions innodb has such as rollback... but it has only table locking

overhead,row-level,problems,table
innodb has more overhead but uses row-level locking so that reads and writes can happen concurrently without the problems that myisam s table locking incurs

first,normal,slower,7x,usage
first question is it normal that innodb is much slower 7x slower than myisam for such usage

faster,data,reporting,etc..,normal
myisam is faster in data warehousing situations such as full table scan reporting etc.. but innodb can actually be faster in many cases with normal oltp queries

figure,contention,faster,rapid,lock
i ve figure out that even though myisam has locking contention it s still faster than innodb in most scenarios because of the rapid lock acquisition scheme it uses

benchmark,results,par,faster,workloads
even this blog from 2007 shows benchmark results that innodb is on par with or faster than myisam under most workloads

correct,wrong,better,tables,row,table
i heard correct me if i am wrong that innodb is better for tables that will be updated a lot because of row locking opposed to myisam s table locking

control,engine,better,table
furthermore i do not have control over the engine â myisam or innodb innodb performs better due to row based locking instead of table as in case of myisam

table,sizes,smaller,tables
as you know myisam table sizes are about three or more times smaller than same innodb tables

space,friendly
myisam is more space friendly than innodb you can start with that one

disk,space,2x-3x
innodb consumes more disk space than myisam -- typically 2x-3x

mysqlhotcopy,inly,tables,applications,better
3 mysqlhotcopy inly works on myisam tables and in most applications you are better off with innodb

exotic,corner,better,certain,work,default
there may be some exotic corner cases where myisam performs marginally better for certain workloads table-scans or high-volume insert-only work but the default choice should be innodb unless you can prove you have a case that myisam does better

tuning,better,engine,different,values,fast-but-unsafe,default
tuning innodb which is the better engine requires adjusting different values than myisam which is often the fast-but-unsafe default

storage,engine,row,level,mysql,optimization
3 a first of all if you haven t done yet change the storage engine to innodb which has row level locking and in newer versions of mysql has more optimization than myisam has

better,tables,available,insert,row,level,updates,table
innodb is usually much better than myisam at tables being available while insert update and delete are happening because innodb uses row level locking for updates whereas myisam uses table level locking

better,spatial,data,postgis.,points,b-trees,adequate
myisam is actually better than innodb for spatial data btw because it also supports r-tree spatial indexes but not as powerful queries as postgis. if you just need points though innodb or myisam b-trees are adequate

memory,at-least,reading,engine,default,mysql
and now i have learned that innodb uses more memory at-least while reading than myisam engine so i am trying to change the default engine of mysql to use myisam

database,engine,longer,whole,table
although 4m isn t that many rows with contention and depending on your structure and database engine it may take a while i think myisam alters take longer than innodb because myisam requires whole table locks and handles concurrency less well

mvcc,multi-versioning,control,complex
innodb implements mvcc multi-versioning concurrency control so locking is much more complex than with myisam

doubt,memory,indexes,better,specific,result
your table sounds fairly large so i doubt it s being held entirely in memory but it sounds like innodb handles indexes better than myisam anyway plus since you re being so specific it may be caching the result of the query

faster,certain,spatial,indexes,transactional,concurrent
myisam is faster for certain queries and supports fulltext and spatial indexes while innodb is transactional and more concurrent

possible,config,engine,efficient,searches
it is possible that the config of your innodb engine is more efficient for your searches than the way you have myisam set up

scalable,properties,acid
innodb is more scalable and myisam doesn t support any of the properties of acid

slower, faster, insert, ---------------------------------------------------

slower,implementation,slow
oh and just incase you were thinking innodb is slower than myisam - the myisam implementation i tested was twice as slow in all counts

slower,databases,row,level
innodb is slower for read only databases because it has features acid compliant row level locking that myisam leaves out

insert,performance,slower,tokudb
at the beginning the insert performance of innodb is almost 50 times slower than myisam and tokudb is 40 times slower than myisam

search,online,articles,faster,select,queries
i did a search online comparing myisam and innodb but all of the articles i read judged myisam being faster than innodb on select queries

storage,engines,faster,select,insert
there is a difference between the different storage engines though myisam is faster for a lot of select innodb is faster for a lot of insert update because it uses row locking instead of table locking and the way it handles indexes

select,queries,2x,faster,updates,insert,slower
select queries in myisam runs 2x faster then in innodb but the updates and insert queries are much slower in myisam

web,applications,faster,situations,access
myisam is still widely used in web applications as it has traditionally been perceived as faster than innodb in situations where most db access is reads

slower,insert,full,index
this also affects how it is stored which leads to myisam being slower than innodb on insert due to myisam requiring a full index re-write on every insertion

slower,inserts,durability,good,performance
if you find that innodb is much slower for inserts updates bear in mind that it offers a much better level of durability - if you tune it for approximately the same durability as myisam then you ll see good performance hopefully

slower,counting,long
i know innodb tends to be a bit slower than myisam on counting but this is far too long

faster,writes,slower,reads,article
i have been told innodb is faster on executing writes but slower than myisam doing reads i cannot back this up and could not find any article that analyses this i do however have the guy that told me this in high regard feel free to ignore this point or do your own research

tables,slower,inserts
innodb tables are even slower than myisam tables for inserts and the delayed key write option is not available

count,group,slower,row
in innodb the count s when where group by or join is not used execute slower than in myisam because the row count is not stored internally

slower,huge,select
also innodb is slower than myisam unless myisam is blocking for a huge select

transactional,inserts,slower
innodb is transactional so inserts will generally be slower than myisam

table,slower,tables,major
innodb table is a bit slower than myisam tables but i don t think it is a major problem as you told you are using drupal system is that a kind of mult-sites like a word-press system

pattern,indexes,slower,full,unrestricted
if you use a where clause though it changes the execution pattern to use indexes so in general innodb will be slower than myisam on full unrestricted counts where as the performance matches up on restricted counts

read-performance,link,slower
edit for the read-performance this link shows that innodb often is actually not slower than myisam

inserts,composite,keys,quicker
innodb handles inserts with composite primary keys quicker than myisam

performance,suprised,read,slower,faster,opposite
i am trying to compare the myisam and innodb write read performance but i am suprised that the myisam s read is much more slower than innodb while its write is much more faster this is totally opposite compared to what i have learned

conclusion,faster,read-only,tables,inserts
2 - i have read about myisam vs innodb the conclusion for me was that myisam is faster when it comes to read-only whereas innodb is designed for tables that get updated or inserts more frequently

slower,transactional,engine
innodb is often slower than myisam being a transactional db engine with acid properties

several,slower,topic,opposite
there are several q a for why is innodb much slower than myisam but i could not find any topic for the opposite

real,slower,authoritative,answer
to answer the real question why is myisam slower than innodb i can t give an authoritative answer

transactions,referential,trade-off,slower
innodb does support transactions and referential integrity but the trade-off is that it is a bit slower than myisam

complex,keys,structure,foreign,slow
innodb provides more complex keys structure than myisam foreign keys and regenerating keys is really slow in innodb

tables,suitable
plus you have to make your tables myisam which is generally less suitable than innodb

tables,bigger,counterparts
innodb tables are about 4x bigger than their myisam counterparts

tests,contention,issues,model,slower
during my tests of innodb v myisam i found that when i did resolve any contention issues the innodb model was 40 slower than myisam

tables,smaller,footprints,ones,myth
myisam tables have smaller footprints than innodb ones myth

longer, primary, rows, ---------------------------------------------------

primary,keys,longer
one thing is that if your inserts are not in the order of increasing primary keys innodb can take a bit longer than myisam

longer,rows
myisam supports longer rows than innodb does

practice,longer
so that means that in practice an innodb write will take 3 times longer than a myisam write

primary,noticeable,difference
innodb is affected by the primary key much more than myisam and it could make a noticeable difference

newer, older, transaction, ---------------------------------------------------

newer,transaction,safe
innodb is relatively newer than myisam and is transaction safe

newer,older
innodb is newer while myisam is older

other---------------------------------------------------

suprise,hours
to our suprise innodb took hours more than myisam


innodb is also being developed more than myisam

reliable
innodb is more reliable than myisam

stricter
innodb is much much stricter than myisam

aware,searches,better,high,volume,exclusive,useful,tables
as you are no doubt aware from your searches innodb is primarily better than myisam for high volume inserts not counting non-comparable features like foreign keys or full text searches which are exclusive to innodb and myisam respectively while myisam is primarily useful for tables which are read more often than they are written to

performant,conundrum,enigma
not sure why people think myisam is more performant than innodb - it s a conundrum wrapped in an enigma

doesnt,number,cached,value,column,null,cause
innodb doesnt read number of rows from stored cached value like myisam does if column is not null cause innodb is more optimized for writing than reading opposing to myisam

prone,problems
myisam is more prone to locking problems than innodb i believe

lone,exception,older,mysql,corruption,worse
the lone exception is myisam which is an older mysql storage engine which does not support transactions is more prone to corruption and generally tends to perform worse than innodb

better,performance,attention,tuning,configuration,atomic,changes,foreign,keys,resistant,data
innodb has better performance than myisam though innodb needs more attention to tuning the configuration innodb supports atomic changes transactions foreign keys and innodb is much more resistant to corrupting data in a crash

memory,dataset,archived
you will need about six times less disk space to store and memory to process your dataset compared to innodb or about 2-3 times less than archived myisam

resources
therefore accessing myisam consumes less resources than innodb
