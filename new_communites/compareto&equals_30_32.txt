return, lesser, values, ---------------------------------------------------

return,negative,integer,object,greater
compareto return a negative integer zero or a positive integer as this object is less than equals to or greater than the specified object

method,returns,value,greater,lesser
the compareto method returns 1 0 or -1 depending on whether value a is respectively greater than equals to or lesser than value b

values,returns,int,greater
compareto compares values and returns an int which tells if the values compare less than equals or greater than

temporary,temporary.compareto,integer,greater,left
implement compareto in temporary temporary.compareto left such that it returns a negative integer zero or a positive integer as temporary is less than equals to or greater than the left

return,value,grater
if this works it seems that u are still comparing the strings in your ordered list and u should now check if the return value of compareto is less grater equals to 0

significance,return,value,greater
the only significance of a compareto return value is if it is greater less than or equals to zero

method,getters,current,object,greater
in the compareto method you can then write the code which will call the getters for the year month and so on until it figures out whether the current object is less than equals to or greater than the object o being passed into the compareto method

javadoc,negative,integer,object,greater
according to javadoc compareto needs to return a negative integer zero or a positive integer as this object is less than equals to or greater than the specified object

method,negative,integer,object,greater
compareto method returns a negative integer zero or a positive integer as this object is less than equals to or greater than the specified object

icomparable,method,integer,greater,relationship
icomparable declares the compareto method which returns an integer that specifies a less than equals to or greater than relationship between two objects of the same type

returns,negative,numbers,object,greater
or is it compareto returns negative numbers 0 and positive numbers respectively indicating whether the calling object is less than equals to or greater than the specified object

interface, page, implementation, ---------------------------------------------------

interface,method,negative,number,first,object,greater
this interface defines the method compareto t which will return a negative number zero or a positive number if the first object is less than equals to or greater than the other one respectively

page,returns,negative,integer,object,greater,object.
per the page i linked to compareto returns a negative integer zero or a positive integer as this object is less than equals to or greater than the specified object.

interface,method,negative,integer,object,greater
the interface defines one method compareto that must return a negative integer zero or a positive integer if this object is less than equals to or greater than the other object respectively

implementation,int,javadoc,negative,integer,object,greater
is a generic type at compile time java will require that an instance provide an implementation of int compareto t o which from the javadoc returns a negative integer zero or a positive integer as this object is less than equals to or greater than the specified object

comparator,int,class,method,integer,object,greater,object.
with this rather than needing to implement a comparator all you need to implement is the int compareto class o method in the class which returns a negative integer zero or a positive integer as this object is less than equals to or greater than the specified object.

advantage,int,method,corresponding,instance,class,greater
note that in both cases you can take advantage of the fact that int also implements so you can use its compareto method to determine whether corresponding values in each instance of your class are less than equals to or greater than each other

min,value,method,returns,first,string,greater,second
i am using the min value because i read that the compareto method returns negative 0 or positive whether the first string is less than equals to or greater than the second

comparison, fields, result, ---------------------------------------------------

method,fields,comparison,greater
in the compareto method you can decide which fields are used for the comparison greater less than or equals

method,result,integer,greater
you need to call the compareto method which will indicate the result of the comparison by returning an integer less than greater than or equals to 0

negative,integer,object,greater
compareto returns a negative integer zero or a positive integer as this object is less than equals to or greater than the specified object

method,certain,date,greater,hours
i am using the compareto method in java to try and check if a certain date is greater than or equals than 24 hours after another date

method,greater
you should be using compareto method for less than or equals or greater than

method,class,signifing,greater,operations
i know that in java there is a compareto method that you can write in a class that will compare two variables and return a value -1 1 or 0 signifing greater than less than and equals to operations

method,argument,greater
the compareto method returns one of -1 0 1 depending on whether or not the argument is less than equals to or greater than respectively

number,greater,first
compareto returns a number that is less than equals to or greater than zero corresponding to the first string being before the same as or after the second string respectively

element,method,treeset
and my guess as to why an element is being dropped is your compareto method never returns a 1 in any case so elements are always considered to be less than or equals to other elements which is probably screwing with the treeset

method,bigger,int
we can call its compareto method to decide whether it is bigger than equals to or less than any int

base,student,greater,studenttocompare,criteria
compareto defines whether your base student is greater than less than or equals to your studenttocompare and you can define these with any criteria you please

first,comparison
all i changed was the first compareto comparison to be less than instead of less than or equals to

other---------------------------------------------------

prefix,performance,worse,lexicographical,false
when one of the strings is a prefix of another the performance of compareto is worse as it still needs to determine the lexicographical ordering while equals won t worry any more and return false immediately

faster,hashcode,slower
most likely hashcode will be faster unless for whatever reason calling hashcode + equals once is much slower than calling compareto log n times
