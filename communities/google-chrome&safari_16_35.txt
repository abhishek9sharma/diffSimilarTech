---------------------------------------------------

susceptible,issue,better,job,realtime,api
google-chrome also is susceptible to this same issue although it does a significantly better job than safari at getting the realtime api re-connected

api,site,error,faster,wtf
this seems to me like a bandwidth error or something like that originally i ve got the error when i played with the html 5 audio api and if i loaded the audio file 10-15 times sequentially then i ve got the error but now i ve discovered that i get the error without the audio api too just by reloading the site a lots of times also safari gives me the error much faster than google-chrome wtf

slower, ---------------------------------------------------

slower,mobile,nitro,engine
the one used by google-chrome and is slower than mobile safari s nitro javascript engine

website,slower,results
if i try to do a google search for website loading slower in google-chrome than in safari i get a lot of results about how safari is slower than google-chrome

ipad,slower,pc
my ipad 1 safari js benchmarked 38 times slower than google-chrome on my pc

smaller, ---------------------------------------------------

middle,smaller,sizes
safari 5.1.10 6534.59.10 middle handles a smaller viewport but in sort order with a smaller viewport computes new image sizes even smaller than google-chrome

fonts,size,smaller
safari will display fonts without a specified size significantly smaller than in google-chrome

makes,child,height,larger
safari makes child block s height larger than google-chrome

version, ---------------------------------------------------

webkit,issue,newer,version
it s not even a webkit issue unless google-chrome s got a newer version than safari

older,version
it also gets broken even more in ios google-chrome which is an older version of safari

earlier,version,webkit,current,pages,browsers
google-chrome also uses an earlier version of webkit than the current safari so pages should be checked in both browsers

older,version,current
safari still uses the older version while google-chrome uses a more current one

better, ---------------------------------------------------

moves,better
i think safari renders the moves better than google-chrome

huge,numbers,better
i guess firefox and safari handle huge numbers of elements better than google-chrome

better,great
safari comes in at just under 41ms performing better than google-chrome but still not great

other---------------------------------------------------

width,button,web,inspector,6px,larger
total width of button in safari web inspector 6px larger than in google-chrome web inspector

testing,forgiving,style,place
from testing this in google-chrome and safari it seems google-chrome is more forgiving in that it parses the style string and puts the right style in place for you but safari does not

diff1,faster
conclusion diff1 is faster in firefox opera and safari diff2 is faster in ie and google-chrome

okay,ios,strict,android,fine
okay safari ios is more strict than google-chrome android when it comes to this all fine but it still needs to enable me to allow the connection through

secure
safari is more secure than ie or google-chrome

background,menu,wider
in safari the background of my menu navigation drop-down menu s is much wider than in google-chrome firefox

stringent,requirements,domain,scripting,share,base
i read somewhere that safari has more stringent requirements on cross domain scripting - it and google-chrome share the same code base

market,invitation,flame
google-chrome has more of the market than safari not and invitation for flame wars just a personal opinion without any weight -

worse
google-chrome is worse than safari

engines,main.js,main.v8.js,main.nitro.js,main.gecko.js
i also have .js files being redirected to javascript engines as well for main.js in google-chrome it tries main.v8.js in safari main.nitro.js in firefox main.gecko.js

wrong,json,harder
dus anyone knows if there is something wrong with my json or if google-chrome is harder to get than safari

likely,straightaway,family,resemblance
so if something works on safari it s more likely to work straightaway on google-chrome more than it is on firefox - but that s just a family resemblance at the end of the day you ll still have to test each as every webkit browser product and version still uses a different version of webkit

browser,results
the browser does not matter though safari gets way more consistently working results than google-chrome

open,sans,bolder,lighter,font,weight,web,fonts
safari renders open sans bolder than in google-chrome so you would need to apply a lighter font weight for safari open sans google web fonts rendering in google-chrome

controller,bar,movement,noticeable,big,blue
the safari controller bar is the quicktime bar which is smaller and dark so the movement is less noticeable than google-chrome which has a big blue progress bar

coverage,market,half,huge,strong
in any case vorbis clearly has the most coverage google-chrome has more of the market than safari now opera is about half of safari and obviously firefox is huge and it doesn t really have the strong opposition that theora has

iphones,ipads,disguise...,portion
a lot of people use iphones ipads and safari is literally the only option even google-chrome is more like safari in disguise... so it s quite a portion of users who are suffering from this issue

smoother,clear,google
safari 5.1 still renders smoother than google-chrome but it is now clear that google has done much improvement

funny,cache,page
safari is more funny than google-chrome i can easily make google-chrome cache my page but safari does not

ios
ios google-chrome is more ios safari than google-chrome itself
