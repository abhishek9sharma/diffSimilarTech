kernel,heuristics,connections,more,aggressive,sockets,connections,more,continuous,processing,sockets
it may be that the kernel heuristics for servering tcp connections is more aggressive than for udp sockets since tcp connections require more state and more continuous processing than do udp sockets

throughput,bigger
i am confused why tcp throughput is bigger than udp

sockets,encapsulations,slower,ofcourse,cost,info,websockets,ideal,server
i was going through internet and so and understood that web sockets are encapsulations to tcp which by itself is slower than udp ofcourse at the cost of reliability but i couldnt find much info if websockets or udp would be ideal to implement such a server

internet,examples,more,overhead
if they are connected over the internet you could try to use the examples for tcp but tcp has more overhead than udp

data,something,better,need,extra
if you re more interested in latency and small amounts of data then something udp based could be better than tcp but you d need to build extra logic for ordering the messages and retrying the lost ones

faster,video,various
udp is significantly faster than tcp and is why it is or was used for video and various things back in the day

socket,more,likely,socket,work
tcp socket is even more likely than udp socket but both work

multicast,lan,cache,identity,main,messages,more,reliable
you could get them to do a udp multicast within a lan environment to identify the programs using protocol messages then have a stored cache of each other s identity and then use tcp to connect and do main exchanging of messages which is more reliable than udp

scenario,better
scenario where udp is better than tcp

scheme,verification,less,stringent
instead you can use udp and implement your own scheme for verification of data that is less stringent than tcp

more,suitable,sets,reliability
i ve considered that udp is more suitable for sending a series of discrete data sets but i need the reliability of tcp

sockets,lower,overhead,packets,recipient
udp sockets have much lower overhead than tcp because packets are not acknowledged by the recipient

better,gcdasyncsocket,case
i think udp will perform better than tcp gcdasyncsocket in your case video transfer

dns,requests,request,response,more,packet
also remember that dns requests can use tcp if the request or response would need more than 1 udp packet

sense,reliable,cannot,faster
in that sense reliable udp cannot be faster than tcp

more,reliable,rmi,corba
what i have thought of so far is that tcp is going to be more reliable than udp and in rmi corba we want network reliability

faster,packets,guarantee
udp is faster than tcp because packets are sent without guarantee of delivery nor order

decision,protocol,connection,more,secure
the decision on yours the tcp protocol used for connection oriented network that is more secure than udp

everything,lighter
if you can do everything with udp it is lighter than tcp

complex,features,more
some protocols are more complex because what s needed are some but not all of the features of tcp but more than what udp provides

sequence,events,socket,harder,socket,normal
when writing your server bear in mind that the sequence of events for a tcp socket is much harder than for a udp socket since as well as the normal socket and bind calls you also have to listen and accept

packets,slower,packets,data,transfer,simple,connection,faster,simple,connection,flow
apart from that tcp packets by themselves are not slower than udp packets and data transfer with a simple tcp connection can be faster than with a simple udp connection because flow control and reliable transfer is already integrated and you don t have to reinvent everything again and often worse

reason,slower,order,packets
the reason i asking this is because i read tcp is slower than udp because tcp ensures order of packets

faster,congestion,detection
udp should be much faster than tcp because there are no acknowledge and congestion detection

smaller,latency,issues,course,bigger,latency
udp gives smaller latency with many many issues to discuss here of course tcp gives bigger latency

in gaming especially fpss udp tends to be the chosen protocol because it s much less chatty than tcp

general,rule,faster,due,less
as a general rule udp is faster than tcp due to less protocol overhead

more,processing,interface,level,itâ
2 tcp needs more processing at network interface level where as in udp itâ s not

congested,network,packets,faster,congestion,account
in a congested network yes udp will send its packets faster than tcp this is because tcp takes then congestion into account using a mechanism called congestion control

faster,faster,due
i though that udp was faster than tcp but do you think that tcp will be faster due to the congestion

data,simpler,connections
also sending receiving data over udp is much simpler than over tcp and it does not require any connections

safety,isp,more,test,sure
the downsides are that it is unreliable messages can be dropped or corrupted therefore you may want to add some safety and that some isp may restrict udp more than tcp test yourself to be sure but usually there is no problems

slower,data,arrival,faster,data
tcp is slower assures data arrival udp is faster data corruption may be possible

confirmation,packets,faster
because there is no confirmation on udp packets it s slightly faster than tcp

better
instead of implementing all these over udp it is much better just to switch to tcp

faster,simple,reason,packet,stream,set,packets,window,size
udp is really faster than tcp and the simple reason is because it s non-existent acknowledge packet ack that permits a continuous packet stream instead of tcp that acknowledges a set of packets calculatd by using the tcp window size and round-trip time rtt .

streaming,audio,less,helpful,rtp,nagling
tcp streaming for audio can be less helpful than udp rtp as you d have to turn off nagling

faster,sure,packet,side,program,ack,packets
i am using udp because it is much faster than tcp but sometimes i need the know for sure if the packet reached to the other side in my program i can not use tcp at all so i am sending ack packets

faster,extra,trip,many,cases,congestion,control
theoretically udp should be be 30-50 faster than tcp because it s missing the extra trip for the ack and has a smaller header overhead however in reality there are many cases where tcp would outperform udp just because of congestion control

more,efficient
it seems like udp will more efficient than tcp

sophisticated,benchmarks,higher,performance,web,services
as an additional note my suspicion is that you d need to indulge yourself in some pretty sophisticated benchmarks before you could conclude that udp is actually going to have higher performance than tcp for web services

specific,protocol,better
if you care a lot about efficiency or really need tens of thousands of connections then implementing your specific protocol in udp will always be better than tcp

nothing,link,bandwidth,better,congestion
it is worth nothing that in a link where udp and tcp are sharing the bandwidth tcp is better behaved than udp in that it will try to limit itself to avoid congestion

faster,simple,reason,packet,stream,set,packets,window,size
udp is faster than tcp and the simple reason is because its nonexistent acknowledge packet ack that permits a continuous packet stream instead of tcp that acknowledges a set of packets calculated by using the tcp window size and round-trip time rtt

note,more,difficult,packets
note that udp is more difficult to work with than tcp because packets are not always guaranteed to be delivered

byte,mtu,faster
i read in a case where a stream of 300 byte packets was being sent over ethernet 1500 byte mtu and tcp was 50 faster than udp

firewalls,simpler
you can use udp as well but if you are dealing with firewalls it is probably going to be simpler with tcp

misconception,faster
also see this other so answer about the misconception that udp is always faster than tcp

windowing,more,expensive,raw,faster,custom

you ve struck lucky with the requirements - because you re going from udp - tcp it s actually a lot simpler than doing udp - udp

faster,simple,nonexistent,packet,stream,set,packets,window,size
udp is faster than tcp and the simple reason is because its nonexistent acknowledge packet ack that permits a continuous packet stream instead of tcp that acknowledges a set of packets calculated by using the tcp window size and round-trip time rtt

faster,simple,non-existent,packet,stream,set,packets,window,size

for example tcp has much more flags window-length syn ack etc - and also starts and ends a connection in a very stable way - the three way handshake - while all udp has is source ip dest ip length source port dest port and checksum

better
instead of implementing all these over udp it is much better just to switch to tcp

data,something,better,need,extra
if you re more interested in latency and small amounts of data then something udp based could be better than tcp but you d need to build extra logic for ordering the messages and retrying the lost ones

latency,crucial,better
since loosing some packets doesn t matter but speed latency is crucial udp is much better than tcp

note,exceptions,firewalls,better,due,security,voip,speech,part,journey

+ consider that the implementation of tcp stack is much more complicated than udp more instructions are executed there

misconception,faster
also see this other so answer about the misconception that udp is always faster than tcp

multicast,lan,cache,identity,main,messages,more,reliable
you could get them to do a udp multicast within a lan environment to identify the programs using protocol messages then have a stored cache of each other s identity and then use tcp to connect and do main exchanging of messages which is more reliable than udp

connection,less,level
udp is connection less but at the same level as tcp

safer,choice,packets,high
i know tcp is a safer choice but let s assume i can only use udp and i need to ensure i can send packets over at a high rate with no missing packets what should i do

less,hungry
alternatively it can be used over udp which is less hungry than tcp

decision,protocol,connection,more,secure
the decision on yours the tcp protocol used for connection oriented network that is more secure than udp

2 tcp needs more processing at network interface level where as in udp itâ s not

nat,traversal,harder,problem
but it sounds like you want to do nat traversal over tcp which is a harder problem than udp

kernel,heuristics,connections,more,aggressive,sockets,connections,more,continuous,processing,sockets
it may be that the kernel heuristics for servering tcp connections is more aggressive than for udp sockets since tcp connections require more state and more continuous processing than do udp sockets

socket,more,likely,socket,work
tcp socket is even more likely than udp socket but both work

timeout,value,slower
try to increase timeout value tcp is slower than udp

slower,machines,lan,reliable
tcp is much slower than udp but when the two machines are not on the same lan udp is not reliable

packet,loss,better
short answer if you can tolerance with any packet loss udp is better otherwise tcp

more,protocol,packet,integrity,packet,loss
as far as tcp goes i think tcp is more generally used protocol for more data-centric requests like chat or things that require packet integrity udp tolerates packet loss to lower latency

scenario,configuration,better
-- in which scenario configuration would i get udp to perform better than tcp

better,reliability
tcp is much better than udp in terms of reliability

specific,protocol,better
if you care a lot about efficiency or really need tens of thousands of connections then implementing your specific protocol in udp will always be better than tcp

faster,faster,due
i though that udp was faster than tcp but do you think that tcp will be faster due to the congestion

client,address,knottier,more,usual
normally a server wouldn t need to know the client s address beforehand but udp s knottier than tcp the more usual stream-oriented approach to socket communication in many ways

firewalls,simpler
you can use udp as well but if you are dealing with firewalls it is probably going to be simpler with tcp

everything,lighter
if you can do everything with udp it is lighter than tcp

experience,code,less,complex,code
in my experience udp based code is generally less complex than tcp based code

more,reliable,guarantee,packet
tcp is certainly going to be more reliable than udp since udp doesn t guarantee packet delivery which is probably why you application is hanging on the receive

faster,flow,control
udp is much faster then tcp but tcp has flow control and guaranteed delivery

faster,extra,trip,reality,many,congestion,control
theoretically udp should be be 30-50 faster than tcp because it s missing the extra trip for the ack and has a smaller header overhead however in reality there are many cases where tcp would outperform udp just because of congestion control

smaller,latency,issues,course,bigger,latency
udp gives smaller latency with many many issues to discuss here of course tcp gives bigger latency

performance,part,lower,performance,tracks,redelivers
if you were attempting to beat the performance of tcp by shifting to udp keep in mind that part of the reason you get lower performance with tcp is because tcp tracks and redelivers the lost packets for you

simpler
a udp stack is considerably simpler than a tcp stack

more,efficient
it seems like udp will more efficient than tcp

dns,requests,request,response,more,packet
also remember that dns requests can use tcp if the request or response would need more than 1 udp packet

tcp as you know udp is faster than tcp even if udp may miss some

general,rule,faster,due,less
as a general rule udp is faster than tcp due to less protocol overhead

real-time,less,latency
udp lends itself to real-time less latency than tcp

i used iperf on two linux machines to send data using both udp and tcp i found that tcp performs better than udp average 65 better

sequence,events,socket,harder,socket,normal
when writing your server bear in mind that the sequence of events for a tcp socket is much harder than for a udp socket since as well as the normal socket and bind calls you also have to listen and accept

congested,network,packets,faster,congestion,account
in a congested network yes udp will send its packets faster than tcp this is because tcp takes then congestion into account using a mechanism called congestion control

things,more,reliable,slower
that among other things is why tcp is considered more reliable but slower than udp

faster,overhead,checking,consistency
udp is generally faster than tcp as it does not have to do the overhead checking of consistency that tcp must deal with

packets,slower,packets,data,transfer,simple,connection,faster,simple,connection,flow
apart from that tcp packets by themselves are not slower than udp packets and data transfer with a simple tcp connection can be faster than with a simple udp connection because flow control and reliable transfer is already integrated and you don t have to reinvent everything again and often worse

results,finishes,faster
what s currently baffling me is in my results tcp finishes almost 2x faster than udp

faster
we propose to use udp over tcp since udp is faster than tcp

quicker
udp is quicker than tcp but if you re using quickfix you ll be using tcp

slower,realtime,multiplayer
tcp is slower than udp and you ll have to mitigate that in realtime multiplayer

smaller,overhead,cost,reliability
udp just has a smaller overhead than tcp but that comes at the cost of reliability

safety,isp,more,test,sure
the downsides are that it is unreliable messages can be dropped or corrupted therefore you may want to add some safety and that some isp may restrict udp more than tcp test yourself to be sure but usually there is no problems

better
tcp is way better then udp for that

more,work,reliability
udp is also more work than tcp if you need reliability which is built in to tcp

less,overhead,faster
udp has less overhead than tcp and is therefore faster

package,bigger,package,smaller,package
the package is bigger than udp s package but smaller than tcp s package

surprising,better
this was surprising for me as i expected udp to perform better than tcp

subject,higher,latencies,client,packet
tcp is subject to higher latencies than udp as it requires the client to send back packet confirmations
