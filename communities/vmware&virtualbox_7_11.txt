faster,good,free
even though vmware has been faster for me i still use virtualbox because it s good enough and is free and im cheap

free,powerfull
virtualbox free but less powerfull than vmware

better, faster, ---------------------------------------------------

better
fwiw i have never gotten freebsd to work properly under virtualbox perhaps if you need that you would be better off with vmware which does

slower
virtualbox is slower than vmware

faster,better,performance
from my experience vmware 5 is faster than virtualbox 4.2 rc3 and has better smp performance

server,better
i am not sure if vmware server will be much better than virtualbox

faster
in my experience i ve found that vmware seems to be faster than virtualbox although i don t have any hard data to back it up

other---------------------------------------------------

features,costs,hand,basic,free,users,licensing,details
vmware has more features but costs 80 virtualbox on the other hand is more basic but is free for most users see virtualbox licensing faq for details

stable,full,usb,crash
however i found that vmware is much more stable full screen resolution much much better to handle the iphone connection via usb and i didn t have yet any crash when on virtualbox it s quite often

hard,worse
im trying very hard to like virtualbox but so far i find it so much worse than vmware in so many ways

feature,bloated,host,system
i really miss this feature on virtualbox because i find vmware to be bloated and it slows the host system down much more than virtualbox does
