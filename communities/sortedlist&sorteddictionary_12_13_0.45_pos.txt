note after doing some benchmarks i found that sorteddictionary is faster for removal but sortedlist is faster for adding and indexing by key

if the sortedlist is populated all at once from sorted data it s faster than sorteddictionary

sortedlist uses less memory than sorteddictionary

Ã¢ sortedlist uses less memory than sorteddictionary

sortedlist tkey tvalue uses less memory than sorteddictionary tkey

sorteddictionary has faster insertion and removal operations for unsorted data o logn as opposed to o n for sortedlist

if the list is populated all at once from sorted data sortedlist is faster than sorteddictionary

ignoring the cost of providing sorted input the oh of sortedlist is smaller than the oh of sorteddictionary

sorteddictionary has faster insertion and removal operations for unsorted data o log n as opposed to o n for sortedlist

i had one further issue that related to the oncollectionchanged - the notifycollectionchangedeventargs required an index as opposed to the item of the sorteddictionary which is doesn t come out of the box it s easier with a sortedlist but anyhow

sortedlist is faster when you want to enumerate the elements and you can access the elements by index and sorteddictionary is faster if there are a lot of elements and you want to insert a new element in the middle of the collection

you should also keep in mind that sortedlist performs worse than sorteddictionary during construction if the items are not inserted in already-sorted order although in this particular case it is highly likely that dates are inserted in chronological sorted order which would be perfect
