more,tricks,complicated,queries,optimizer,optimizer
in general postgresql knows more tricks for how to optimize complicated queries than the mysql optimizer does but it also relies heavily on your having given the optimizer enough data to work with

easier,way
mysql is easier than postgresql but it doesn t really matter either way

sql,features,more,advanced,tendency,things
however postgresql s sql features are far more advanced than mysql s and mysql has a tendency to silently ignore things you tell it to do - especially in a default installation and if you rely on a foreign key to be created that might be a very unpleasant surprise

more,compliant,standard,group,clause
following the first answer it appears that postgresql is more compliant to sql standard than mysql so it needs a group by clause for each selected column you want to display with your aggregated function

reputation,things,better,good,similar,performance
given postgresql s reputation for doing things better than mysql or at least as good as i daresay that postgresql would demonstrate similar performance if properly used

more,capable,needs,alex,suggestion
mysql is more than capable of serving your needs as well as alex s suggestion of postgresql

slower,more,query
do you find rails with postgresql is slower than mysql knowing that it produce more query on the background

something,needs,better
also you might take the time to compare postgresql and see if there is something about it that meets your needs as well or better than mysql

more,mature,robust
i feel postgresql is much more mature and robust than mysql

better
the other question is that what i am hearing from our group leader is that postgresql is better than mysql when working with coordinates

more,correct,database,implementation,less,correct
from how i understand it postgresql is a more correct database implementation while mysql is less correct less compliant but faster

bit,more,restrictive
postgresql is a bit more restrictive than mysql

cleaner,easier
however people often argue that postgresql is cleaner and easier to use that mysql

more,famous,serious,enterprise-quality,data,critical
while mysql is more famous for serious enterprise-quality database where preserving your data is critical i recommend postgresql

more,capable,more,features,queries,datatypes,tuning,options
i suggest postgresql it s more capable has more features and better support for complex queries and datatypes than mysql and has a lot of tuning options

older
postgresql is older than mysql so it might have influenced them

more,security,features,integration,gssapi,logins,last
postgresql supports some more security features than mysql for example integration with gssapi or kerberos for logins last i checked mysql didn t have these

faster
postgresql is faster than mysql s innodb

more,popular,instagram,due
though mysql is more popular than postgresql but instagram is using postgresql maybe due to these reasons

sure,better,things,better,uses
now i m not sure if i d say postgresql is generally better than mysql -- there are certainly things that mysql does much better and so it certainly has its uses -- but these are a few things i absolutely love about it

stricter,sql,standard
postgresql is stricter to the sql standard than mysql is

more,shared,providers,more,powerful
mysql is probably more often offered by shared hosting providers postgresql is probably a little more powerful

slower,mongo,db
in my personal openion mysql is slower than postgresql and mongo db

better,respect
postgresql is way better than mysql in nearly every respect

more,reliable,myisam,innodb
as for reliability i think that postgresql is more reliable especially when compared to mysql using myisam - innodb is a lot better here

may be postgresql takes less time than mysql

smarter
if you want open source postgresql is much smarter than mysql as well

higher,pdo,higher
drupal 7 mysql 5.0.15 or higher with pdo postgresql 8.3 or higher

faster,transactions,sound
mysql i am told can be optimized to do faster reads than postgresql but both are pretty ridiculously fast in terms of # transactions sec they support and it doesn t sound like that s your problem

interpretation,sql,standard,stricter,type,query
i am aware that postgresql interpretation of the sql standard is stricter than mysql and that consequently this type of query won t work...and have read a number of posts on stackoverflow and elsewhere on the subject - but none of them seem to be the definitive answer on this subject

syntax,bit,more,complex,procedures,action
triggers in postgresql have a syntax a bit more complex than mysql because they execute procedures as the action

slower,fine,tuning
in most regards postgresql is slower than mysql especially when it comes to fine tuning in the end

indexes,better
i really like postgresql s indexes which are far better than mysql s

beginner,fewer,surprises
i would recommend postgresql for a beginner as it has far fewer surprises than mysql

worse
i just checked the timings using mysql 5 and they are slightly worse than postgresql

better
if you need spatial data capabilities postgis with postgresql is better than mysql

complex,activerecord,15s,more,nested,loops
i had mentioned that in our rails application all select queries dropped below 100ms after switching to postgresql whereas some of the complex joins generated by activerecord would occasionally take as much as 15s or more with mysql 5.1 because of nested loops with inner table scans even when indices were available

more,tuning,optimal,performance
postgresql requires more tuning than mysql to achieve optimal performance

harder
does this affect postgresql harder than mysql

better,vice-versa
an efficiently configured mysql is better than a badly configured postgresql and vice-versa

more,established,support,last,year
postgresql has more established support for this but mysql has played catch up in the last year or so and has a working method of this in the latest versions

more,popular,feature,out-of-the-box
it s a shame postgresql isn t more popular than mysql since it supports exactly this feature out-of-the-box you d only have to share one sequence object between tables.

better,support,support,storage,engine
postgresql has better support but the support by mysql depends on the used storage engine

more,resistant,sql,injection
the question is is mysql somehow more resistant than postgresql to sql injection attack under the perl dbi and why might this be the case

more,proven,huge,data
either postgresql more proven than mysql for such huge data

stricter,conversions,error,string
postgresql is stricter about conversions than mysql is and generally will throw an error rather than try to convert a string to an integer if it doesn t look like one

bad,longterm,good,java,better,db,satisfied
anyways mysql is bad and on longterm especially if you are enough good for java i suggest you to use some better db with postgresql you were really satisfied i think

better,option,query,likely
in your case postgresql may be a better option than mysql because your query is going to likely be against secondary indexes

servers,less,troublesome,table,way
this is ancedotal but the postgresql servers i ve managed have always been much less troublesome than mysql which likes to randomly crash once in a while occasionally corrupting a table on the way down

less,popular,serious,web
while postgresql is less popular than mysql most of the serious web hosting supports it

version,faster,more,advanced
mysql s version is apparently marginally faster than postgresql but lacks some of the more advanced spatial features therefore it s pretty much limited to finding records that match a certain range of coordinates

more,compliant
looks like postgresql is a little more compliant than mysql so try this instead

larger,user,base,more,more
while mysql has a larger user base postgresql is gaining more an more popularity ever since implementing several crucial features that were missing in earlier versions

better,many,ways
postgresql is better than mysql in many ways

more,advanced
postgresql is worth learning and much more advanced than mysql

better,imo,database,django
postgresql is also a lot better imo than mysql and is the recommended database to use with django according to a lot of the people close to django

recursive,queries,form,recursive,data,easier,better,performance
postgresql supports recursive queries in the form of recursive common table expressions which make querying heirarchical data easier than in mysql and also give better performance

recent,tests,faster,table,feature,important,table
some recent tests we did showed that postgresql does perform faster than mysql and we believe the table partitioning feature in postgresql will be very important with a table in our database we foresee to grow into 100 million rows and more in production

better,choice,hierarchical,data,ready
i was told that postgresql is a better choice than mysql for displaying hierarchical data so i installed postgresql and i m ready to go

more,sane,many,tricks
since postgresql is a lot more sane than mysql there are not that many tricks to report on

more,compliant,comfortable,orm
postgresql is more compliant but if you re comfortable with mysql and you re using an orm you should probably use that

safer,bet
if i were able to upgrade the server s versioning of mysql to 5.5 would innodb be a safer bet than postgresql

scales,better,multi-processor,requests
fyi postgresql scales better than mysql on multi-processor overlapping requests from a review i was reading a few months back sorry no link

more,permissive,non-standard,use,distinct,error
mysql is more permissive and allows the non-standard use of distinct but postgresql throws an error

faster,big,tables
according to my own experience postgresql run much faster than mysql especially handling big tables 1.4 gb lineitem table in my case

simple,queries,slower,richer,planner
for these ultra simple queries postgresql can be slower than mysql - postgresql has richer planner that works better on more complex queries but on trivial queries is slower

better,purpose
is postgresql better than mysql for such purpose

more,powerful,scalable,silly,limitations
postgresql is far more powerful and scalable and doesn t have mysql s silly limitations and gotchas

software,oracle,more,powerful
i cannot propose any db not knowing your specific needs but if you want to use a free software which excludes oracle and you re not already experienced with mysql you should try postgresql which is more powerful than mysql

better
i would need a scalable database so probably postgresql would be better than mysql

research,better,support,schemas,way
the only reason i was considering postgresql was that some research suggested postgresql has much better support for changing schemas along the way than mysql

more,robust,crash,situations
i hear postgresql is more robust and doesn t crash like mysql does in these situations

better,option,tables,date
is postgresql a better option than mysql for partitioning tables by date

better,changes,rollbacks
this is a weak point that iirc postgresql can handle better but with mysql you have to work around that by reverting the changes yourself in case of rollbacks

more
does that mean perhaps rails team favor postgresql slightly more than mysql

better
what i am hearing from our group leader is that postgresql is better than mysql when working with coordinates

better
and a wiki for why postgresql is better than mysql

more,little,easier,cool,features
mysql is more widely supported and a little easier to use but postgresql has some very cool features and functionality that s worth taking a gander at

btw,more,incase,things
i am using postgresql btw which can do more than mysql incase that changes things

more
if you are looking for location based queries in relational databases postgresql is more matured compared to mysql

explain in postgresql is way more useful than in mysql

better
then postgresql is much better than mysql

postgresql is much more similar to oracle than mysql is

mariadb,worse
mysql mariadb is slightly worse than postgresql

django,easy,query,data,db,faster,x10,more,shows,indexes
with django it is easy to use postgresql instead of mysql so i tried it with the same query and same data in db postgresql is much faster that mysql x10 more faster while using inner join analyse shows it uses indexes unlike mysql

better,security,purposes,more,feature
some people were saying that postgresql is better for security purposes whereas mysql is becoming more feature rich.

better,capabilities,json,versions
i found that postgresql 9.3 has better capabilities for json than the mysql versions i am using

bigger,repertoar,indexes,gist,gin
b use indexes - postgresql has bigger repertoar of indexes then mysql so use it - there are gist gin indexes

more,capable,others,django
why postgresql is more capable than others mysql etc. on django

less,thing
mysql is not less complicated that postgresql -- they re the same thing

incomplete,version,opengis,support,proper,indexing,geospatial,actions,better,postgis,sure
in fact this presentation which still refers to an older incomplete version of mysql s opengis support suggests that with proper indexing some mysql geospatial actions may actually perform better than postgresql postgis though i m sure that s up for debate

scales,better
honestly though postgresql scales much better than mysql

run,4x,faster
mysql run 4x faster than postgresql

better,workloads,better
there are workloads where postgresql is better and there are workloads where mysql is better

slower
i did a simple performance test and i noticed postgresql is slower than mysql

picky,pickier,fields,select
postgresql is picky pickier than mysql -- all fields in the select list when using distinct must be present in the order_by and group_by clauses

ok,wrong,fields,aggregation,function,stricter,sql,site_id,query
but in mysql it is ok and in postgresql it is wrong and ask for the other fields besides site_id either in a group by clause or in a aggregation function i know that postgresql is stricter on sql than mysql so i must select the site_id in the query object of msg_published but in pure sqlalchemy i can do like this

large,databases,frequent,better
if you want to use sql i strongly reccommend postgresql it seems to deal with large databases and frequent writes a lot better than mysql

better,speed
postgresql seem to better than mysql in terms of speed

superior,hate,bizarre,bugs,overall,performance,better,complicated,query
as i said postgresql is far superior and i hate mucking with mysql s bizarre bugs and i think that overall postgresql performance is probably better than mysql for any even slightly complicated query

more,strict,type,conversion
postgresql is a little more strict than mysql about type conversion and does not let you implicitly cast convert between numbers and strings

more,advanced,complicated,statements
the query optimizer in postgresql is more advanced than in mysql and copes with complicated statements much better especially when it comes to sub-selects

optional,hstore,module,better,this.
postgresql with the optional hstore module might be better than mysql at this.

better,data,warehousing
postgresql is much better suited for data warehousing compared to mysql

better,handling,complex,queries,sub-selects,like,users
i also personally believe that postgresql has better handling of complex queries that include sub-selects and the like which most mysql users used to avoid

fewer,security,issues
traditionally postgresql has had fewer security issues than mysql but they are both doing very well on that

splendid,open-source,sql,database,more,standard,py-postgresql
for example pyqt is already available for python 3 as well as 2 and you can use postgresql a splendid open-source sql database engine much more standard than mysql via py-postgresql

better,worse,unicode
in other words is mysql better or worse than postgresql to handle unicode etc

license,bsd,more,simple
postgresql license bsd is undoubtedly more simple than mysql s

bit,more,robust,free
there is also postgresql its a bit more robust than mysql and is free just the same

operations,better
generally speaking i find postgresql lends itself to 24 7 operations better than mysql

select,count,slower
unfortunately in postgresql select count is often slower than mysql to which it often get s compared to

more,forgiving,reserved,word
it seems mysql is more forgiving with this than postgresql but in every case you use a reserved word you should escape it

slower,certain,point
postgresql is already slower than mysql up to a certain point it is actually faster when you have a ridiculously large database

more,complete,solid,better,queries,optimization,retrieval,speed
postgresql is much more complete and solid and will much better support complex queries and their optimization while mysql may shine in terms of retrieval speed for extremely simple queries

implementation,less,sql,implementation
i totally understand the error and assume that the mysql implementation is less sql conform than the postgresql implementation

more,smart,plan,sql,server,oracle
poor performance from mysql has more to do with it not being smart and automatically creating an optimized plan like sql server postgresql or oracle would

more,mature,thanks,mvcc,row-locking,feature,token,field
i know postgresql could be considered more mature than mysql with regards to locking thanks to mvcc - can i use row-locking or some other feature in postgresql instead of the token field

slew,problems,better
i just recently switched databases to postgresql which has given me a slew of problems although i must admit i like it a lot better than mysql

better
with correct locking for safety reasons and heavy concurrent use postgresql performed better than mysql

nested,comments,hierarchical,better
i d also recommend postgresql over mysql if you are going to have nested comments as postgresql does hierarchical querying better than mysql

more,compliant
postgresql is more sql compliant than mysql

fewer,experienced,administrators,big,databases,reputation
and postgresql has fewer experienced administrators than the big databases and mysql which i believe contributes to the reputation

single,insert,statement,faster,autocommit
i wonder why postgresql s single insert statement is completely faster than mysql s when autocommit is turned on

bit,easier,aspects,more,logical
you might look at postgresql as i find it a bit easier to manage and maintain as i feel some aspects are more logical than mysql

easier,simplicity,advantage
postgresql specifically has gotten easier to manage while mysql has lost some of the simplicity that gave it an advantage without picking up enough features that really matter

expirience,slower
i ve found that postgresql is in my expirience is slower as mysql

better,performance,former,partisan
postgresql gets much better performance and this is coming from a former mysql partisan

large,datasets,fulltext,10-100x,faster,xapian,10-100x,faster,integrated
i did some benchmarking 3 years ago may be stale... which showed that on large datasets basically postgresql fulltext is 10-100x faster than mysql and xapian 10-100x faster than postgresql but not integrated

smarter,right,indexes
ps you can also migrate to postgresql it s smarter than mysql when choosing right indexes

more,flexible,indexing,table,approaches
not only does postgresql have a far more flexible indexing than mysql but the table approaches are very different also meaning the appropriate indexing strategies are as different as the tactics are

better,bigger,projects,others
some say mysql is much better for bigger projects while others think just go with postgresql

more,security,aware,roles,more
i d have said that postgresql is more security aware than mysql supporting roles more authentication methods ... but that the database itself has generally a very limited impact on the security of an application

more,acid,compliant,fks,post
all that said postgresql is much more acid compliant than mysql it handles fks just as you re needing and i would generally recommend it based on what you ve expressed in your post
