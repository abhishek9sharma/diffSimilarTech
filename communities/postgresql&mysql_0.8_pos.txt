mysql is easier than postgresql but it doesn t really matter either way

however people often argue that postgresql is cleaner and easier to use that mysql

1---------------------------------------------------

postgresql seem to better than mysql in terms of speed

i really like postgresql s indexes which are far better than mysql s

generally speaking i find postgresql lends itself to 24 7 operations better than mysql

is postgresql better than mysql for such purpose

postgresql is way better than mysql in nearly every respect

honestly though postgresql scales much better than mysql

there are workloads where postgresql is better and there are workloads where mysql is better

an efficiently configured mysql is better than a badly configured postgresql and vice-versa

then postgresql is much better than mysql

and a wiki for why postgresql is better than mysql

2---------------------------------------------------

i would need a scalable database so probably postgresql would be better than mysql

postgresql is much better suited for data warehousing compared to mysql

i was told that postgresql is a better choice than mysql for displaying hierarchical data so i installed postgresql and i m ready to go

if you need spatial data capabilities postgis with postgresql is better than mysql

i found that postgresql 9.3 has better capabilities for json than the mysql versions i am using

3---------------------------------------------------

postgresql is a bit more restrictive than mysql

postgresql will always be a little bit more mature than mysql

there is also postgresql its a bit more robust than mysql and is free just the same

4---------------------------------------------------

for these ultra simple queries postgresql can be slower than mysql - postgresql has richer planner that works better on more complex queries but on trivial queries is slower

postgresql is much more complete and solid and will much better support complex queries and their optimization while mysql may shine in terms of retrieval speed for extremely simple queries

5---------------------------------------------------

postgresql is more sql compliant than mysql

looks like postgresql is a little more compliant than mysql so try this instead

6---------------------------------------------------

i just checked the timings using mysql 5 and they are slightly worse than postgresql

mysql mariadb is slightly worse than postgresql

7---------------------------------------------------

if you want to use sql i strongly reccommend postgresql it seems to deal with large databases and frequent writes a lot better than mysql

i just recently switched databases to postgresql which has given me a slew of problems although i must admit i like it a lot better than mysql

postgresql is also a lot better imo than mysql and is the recommended database to use with django according to a lot of the people close to django

8---------------------------------------------------

i would recommend postgresql for a beginner as it has far fewer surprises than mysql

traditionally postgresql has had fewer security issues than mysql but they are both doing very well on that

9---------------------------------------------------

in other words is mysql better or worse than postgresql to handle unicode etc

in my cases postgresql was better than mysql mysql do not completely support unicode

10---------------------------------------------------

the query optimizer in postgresql is more advanced than in mysql and copes with complicated statements much better especially when it comes to sub-selects

in general postgresql knows more tricks for how to optimize complicated queries than the mysql optimizer does but it also relies heavily on your having given the optimizer enough data to work with

11---------------------------------------------------

now i m not sure if i d say postgresql is generally better than mysql -- there are certainly things that mysql does much better and so it certainly has its uses -- but these are a few things i absolutely love about it

postgresql is better than mysql in many ways

12---------------------------------------------------

what i am hearing from our group leader is that postgresql is better than mysql when working with coordinates

the other question is that what i am hearing from our group leader is that postgresql is better than mysql when working with coordinates
