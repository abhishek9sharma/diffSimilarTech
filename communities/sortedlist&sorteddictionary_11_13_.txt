note,benchmarks,faster,removal,indexing
note after doing some benchmarks i found that sorteddictionary is faster for removal but sortedlist is faster for adding and indexing by key

data,faster
if the sortedlist is populated all at once from sorted data it s faster than sorteddictionary

list,data,faster
if the list is populated all at once from sorted data sortedlist is faster than sorteddictionary

faster,insertion,data,log
sorteddictionary has faster insertion and removal operations for unsorted data o log n as opposed to o n for sortedlist

faster,elements,index
sortedlist is faster when you want to enumerate the elements and you can access the elements by index and sorteddictionary is faster if there are a lot of elements and you want to insert a new element in the middle of the collection

faster,insertion,unsorted,data
sorteddictionary has faster insertion and removal operations for unsorted data o logn as opposed to o n for sortedlist

index,item,box,easier
i had one further issue that related to the oncollectionchanged - the notifycollectionchangedeventargs required an index as opposed to the item of the sorteddictionary which is doesn t come out of the box it s easier with a sortedlist but anyhow

1---------------------------------------------------

tkey,tvalue,memory
sortedlist tkey tvalue uses less memory than sorteddictionary tkey

â,memory
â sortedlist uses less memory than sorteddictionary

memory
sortedlist uses less memory than sorteddictionary

other---------------------------------------------------

faster
sortedlist is faster than sorteddictionary

worse,construction,items
you should also keep in mind that sortedlist performs worse than sorteddictionary during construction if the items are not inserted in already-sorted order although in this particular case it is highly likely that dates are inserted in chronological sorted order which would be perfect

cost,input,smaller
ignoring the cost of providing sorted input the oh of sortedlist is smaller than the oh of sorteddictionary
