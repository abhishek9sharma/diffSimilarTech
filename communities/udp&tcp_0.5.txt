udp is not always faster than tcp

does udp always perform better than tcp

this was surprising for me as i expected udp to perform better than tcp

-- does udp always perform better than tcp

4 tcp is a slower than udp

1---------------------------------------------------

the fact that udp s header size is less than tcp s is because is a simpler protocol that needs less header space that s all there is to it

why the header size of udp is less than tcp

2---------------------------------------------------

udp is way lighter and faster but somewhat less reliable than tcp

and there are no handshakings required udp are pretty much faster but less reliable than tcp

3---------------------------------------------------

tcp is way better then udp for that

or is there any specific scenario where udp is better than tcp

scenario where udp is better than tcp

for some requirements tcp is better for some udp

4---------------------------------------------------

tcp is reliable but slower than udp while udp is not safe and i have to implement my own fault-handling codes

but with the udp protocol in particular this is easier than for tcp

tcp is a slower more reliable protocol than udp is

5---------------------------------------------------

with tcp its slightly slower than udp and has more features

because there is no confirmation on udp packets it s slightly faster than tcp

only when packets can be discarded unordered can udp be faster than tcp

tcp is a bit slower than udp but more failsafe

6---------------------------------------------------

don t think of it as udp is faster and tcp is slower because that s just wrong

i don t think you should make the assumption that udp is faster than tcp

i though that udp was faster than tcp but do you think that tcp will be faster due to the congestion

7---------------------------------------------------

i read in a case where a stream of 300 byte packets was being sent over ethernet 1500 byte mtu and tcp was 50 faster than udp

for example i read an experiment in which a stream of 300 byte packets was being sent over ethernet 1500 byte mtu and tcp was 50 faster than udp

8---------------------------------------------------

i used iperf on two linux machines to send data using both udp and tcp i found that tcp performs better than udp average 65 better

but when i used iperf on two linux machines to send data using both udp and tcp i found that tcp performs better than udp for 10mb of data

9---------------------------------------------------

udp has less overhead than tcp and is therefore faster

udp is faster and requires less bandwidth than tcp

10---------------------------------------------------

i know udp is faster than tcp for various reason

udp has a much lower overhead than tcp

this is the reason why udp is much faster than tcp

certainly tcp has more overhead than udp

11---------------------------------------------------

udp is faster than tcp and the simple reason is because its nonexistent acknowledge packet ack that permits a continuous packet stream instead of tcp that acknowledges a set of packets calculated by using the tcp window size and round-trip time rtt

udp is really faster than tcp and the simple reason is because it s non-existent acknowledge packet ack that permits a continuous packet stream instead of tcp that acknowledges a set of packets calculatd by using the tcp window size and round-trip time rtt .
