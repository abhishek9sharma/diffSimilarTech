tcp is slower than udp and you ll have to mitigate that in realtime multiplayer

yes udp is much much lighter than tcp

tcp is reliable but slower than udp while udp is not safe and i have to implement my own fault-handling codes

tcp is certainly going to be more reliable than udp since udp doesn t guarantee packet delivery which is probably why you application is hanging on the receive

udp communication requires much less overhead than tcp due to the number of messages exchanged

udp packets are easier structured than tcp packets but sacrifice security for their size

but when i used iperf on two linux machines to send data using both udp and tcp i found that tcp performs better than udp for 10mb of data

udp should be much faster than tcp because there are no acknowledge and congestion detection

the problem with using tcp is obviously that it is a lot slower than udp

udp sockets have much lower overhead than tcp because packets are not acknowledged by the recipient

one can say udp has a lower overhead than tcp because its packets have a smaller header and therefore take less bandwidth to send the payload the data

tcp has bigger overhead than udp because it needs to add more data to your payload but you are guaranteed that your data will be received in it s destination in the order you sent it and not corrupted

udp will almost always provide better performance than tcp at the cost of reliability

certainly tcp has more overhead than udp

udp has less overhead than tcp and is therefore faster

udp has a much lower overhead than tcp

udp lends itself to real-time less latency than tcp

tcp has to do a lot of error checking to ensure that your packets don t get dropped and so tcp is much slower than udp

i used iperf on two linux machines to send data using both udp and tcp i found that tcp performs better than udp average 65 better

udp just has a smaller overhead than tcp but that comes at the cost of reliability

the reason i asking this is because i read tcp is slower than udp because tcp ensures order of packets

that among other things is why tcp is considered more reliable but slower than udp

what i have thought of so far is that tcp is going to be more reliable than udp and in rmi corba we want network reliability

in that sense reliable udp cannot be faster than tcp

in some applications tcp is faster better throughput than udp

because there is no confirmation on udp packets it s slightly faster than tcp

as a general rule udp is faster than tcp due to less protocol overhead

if the data is critical you should go for tcp which is slower as compared to udp which in fact doesn t guarantee the packets will arrive in order or even if they d arrive or not

if you can do everything with udp it is lighter than tcp

udp is generally faster than tcp as it does not have to do the overhead checking of consistency that tcp must deal with

moreover tcp has more processing overhead than udp

like matzi suggested udp gives you lower latency and lower packet overhead as the header is smaller than tcp but on the downside the delivery of the packet to the destination is never guaranteed ie

tcp mounts are more reliable and you know you have a network problem much faster than with udp

i know tcp is a safer choice but let s assume i can only use udp and i need to ensure i can send packets over at a high rate with no missing packets what should i do

most importantly you can easily supplement udp with some reliable delivery hand-shaking that s less overhead than tcp

i though that udp was faster than tcp but do you think that tcp will be faster due to the congestion

tcp is much better than udp in terms of reliability

this is the reason why udp is much faster than tcp

only when packets can be discarded unordered can udp be faster than tcp

tcp is a slower more reliable protocol than udp is

the problem is that tcp creates bigger packages of data while udp uses 8 kb of data blocks

at my company we have found memory mapped files to be much faster than loopback tcp ip for communication on the same box so i m assuming it would be faster than udp too

generally speaking udp has less overhead than tcp allowing you to receive more data but this is not a strict rule and is almost negligible in this context

tcp is a bit slower than udp but more failsafe

tcp is much slower than udp but when the two machines are not on the same lan udp is not reliable

udp is way lighter and faster but somewhat less reliable than tcp

http is an application layer protocol which could be encapsulated with a protocol that uses udp providing arguably faster reliable communication than tcp

udp protocol is unreliable but much much faster than tcp which is most commonly used for communication

udp is faster than tcp because packets are sent without guarantee of delivery nor order

1---------------------------------------------------

but it sounds like you want to do nat traversal over tcp which is a harder problem than udp

it was introduced since the nat traversal for tcp is much more complicated than udp

tcp is way better then udp for that

this was surprising for me as it is well known fact that udp performs better than tcp

4 tcp is a slower than udp

does udp always perform better than tcp

udp is simpler protocol than tcp and you can still simulate features of tcp using udp

actually we could say that tcp is a higher level protocol compared to udp because tcp includes some advanced features which might be useful .

udp is significantly easier do you really need tcp btw

-- in which scenario configuration would i get udp to perform better than tcp

udp is not always faster than tcp

also see this other so answer about the misconception that udp is always faster than tcp

this was surprising for me as i expected udp to perform better than tcp

-- does udp always perform better than tcp

as such traversing a nat through udp is much easier than tcp

but with the udp protocol in particular this is easier than for tcp

a udp stack is considerably simpler than a tcp stack

with tcp its slightly slower than udp and has more features

you can use udp as well but if you are dealing with firewalls it is probably going to be simpler with tcp

first of udp s datagram is simpler than tcp s one

some protocols are more complex because what s needed are some but not all of the features of tcp but more than what udp provides

instead of implementing all these over udp it is much better just to switch to tcp

or is there any specific scenario where udp is better than tcp

i suppose this is one of the reasons for the misconception that udp is slower than tcp

udp is quicker than tcp but if you re using quickfix you ll be using tcp

in doing so the tradefoff is that tcp becomes slower compared to udp

scenario where udp is better than tcp

2---------------------------------------------------

i was expecting that udp would be faster but tcp is on average two times faster than udp

what s currently baffling me is in my results tcp finishes almost 2x faster than udp

3---------------------------------------------------

tcp socket is even more likely than udp socket but both work

i m trying to avoid tcpclient because udp is faster but would this work in tcp since it s streamed

udp is also more work than tcp if you need reliability which is built in to tcp

4---------------------------------------------------

while udp has less network overhead than tcp it generally relies on you the developer to come up with your own mechanisms for flow control fragmentation handling lost packets etc.

in a congested network yes udp will send its packets faster than tcp this is because tcp takes then congestion into account using a mechanism called congestion control

5---------------------------------------------------

udp is connection less but at the same level as tcp

udp communication is connection less as compared to tcp which need a connection

6---------------------------------------------------

the decision on yours the tcp protocol used for connection oriented network that is more secure than udp

in general the tcp protocol manages the available network bandwidth better than the udp protocol

7---------------------------------------------------

udp is really faster than tcp and the simple reason is because it s non-existent acknowledge packet ack that permits a continuous packet stream instead of tcp that acknowledges a set of packets calculatd by using the tcp window size and round-trip time rtt .

8---------------------------------------------------

it seems like udp will more efficient than tcp

and there are no handshakings required udp are pretty much faster but less reliable than tcp

9---------------------------------------------------

i read in a case where a stream of 300 byte packets was being sent over ethernet 1500 byte mtu and tcp was 50 faster than udp

for example i read an experiment in which a stream of 300 byte packets was being sent over ethernet 1500 byte mtu and tcp was 50 faster than udp

10---------------------------------------------------

why the header size of udp is less than tcp

getting much more information is needed in the packet header for connection less like udp but why the header size of udp is less than tcp

the fact that udp s header size is less than tcp s is because is a simpler protocol that needs less header space that s all there is to it

you will notice that the tcp header has more fields than the udp header and many of those fields will be populated by information from the handshake
