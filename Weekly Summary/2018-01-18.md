### I tried to implement the method proposed by:

[Jindal, N., & Liu, B. (2006). Identifying comparative sentences in text documents. *Sigir*, 244. http://doi.org/10.1145/1148170.1148215](https://github.com/hy3440/diffSimilarTech/blob/master/Related%20Papers/Identifying%20comparative%20sentences%20in%20text%20documents.pdf)

1. Use [83 key words and key phrases](https://github.com/hy3440/diffSimilarTech/blob/master/Related%20Papers/comparative-lexicon.pdf) to extract sentences: [1415 comparative sentences in total 6314 sentences (1219 posts)](https://github.com/hy3440/diffSimilarTech/blob/master/Data/data.txt)
2. Use the words that are within the radius of 3 of each keyword in the sentence as a sequence. Each word is then replaced with its POS tag. Generate CSR rules.
3. However, requires manually annotated training corpus.
4. [Li et al. (2013)](https://github.com/hy3440/diffSimilarTech/blob/master/Related%20Papers/Comparable%20Entity%20Mining%20from%20Comparative%20Questions.pdf) suspect that their rules might be too specific and overfit their small training set (about 2,600 sentences).

### I found four new related papers:

   * App aliases: e.g. *Facebook* -> *fb*
   * Comparative patterns:

CV: comparative verbs, e.g. prefer, recommend

CIN: comparative prepositions, e.g. than, over

APP: app references, including app names and aliases, e.g. facebook, fb
