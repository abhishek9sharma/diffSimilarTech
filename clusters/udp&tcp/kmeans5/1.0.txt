udp is faster and requires less bandwidth than tcp

certainly tcp has more overhead than udp

udp has a much lower overhead than tcp

udp communication requires much less overhead than tcp due to the number of messages exchanged

udp lends itself to real-time less latency than tcp

moreover tcp has more processing overhead than udp

udp has less overhead than tcp and is therefore faster

udp just has a smaller overhead than tcp but that comes at the cost of reliability
