udp is more popular in nat punching because provides much better results than tcp

that among other things is why tcp is considered more reliable but slower than udp

udp protocol is unreliable but much much faster than tcp which is most commonly used for communication

as a general rule udp is faster than tcp due to less protocol overhead

in some applications tcp is faster better throughput than udp

udp is generally faster than tcp as it does not have to do the overhead checking of consistency that tcp must deal with

+ consider that the implementation of tcp stack is much more complicated than udp more instructions are executed there

most importantly you can easily supplement udp with some reliable delivery hand-shaking that s less overhead than tcp

if the network between the two point have a very high quality udp is absolutely faster than tcp but in some other case such as the gprs network tcp may been faster and more reliability than udp

tcp is much better than udp in terms of reliability

a udp stack is considerably simpler than a tcp stack

udp is way lighter and faster but somewhat less reliable than tcp

in gaming especially fpss udp tends to be the chosen protocol because it s much less chatty than tcp

udp scales better than tcp because of reduced states that need to be maintained in the operating system

but there are some cases especially in iot domain udp is more popular than tcp for its bigger transport overheads

tcp sockets- guaranteed delivery bigger payload than udp cumbersome to setup for web based solutions

actually we could say that tcp is a higher level protocol compared to udp because tcp includes some advanced features which might be useful .

udp will almost always provide better performance than tcp at the cost of reliability

also if you have very limited memory processing resources it is worth bearing in mind that udp is a less costly protocol as it avoids a lot of the overheads tcp incurs due to its inbuilt connection management

some protocols are more complex because what s needed are some but not all of the features of tcp but more than what udp provides

yes udp is much much lighter than tcp

if you re more interested in latency and small amounts of data then something udp based could be better than tcp but you d need to build extra logic for ordering the messages and retrying the lost ones

udp gives smaller latency with many many issues to discuss here of course tcp gives bigger latency

it was introduced since the nat traversal for tcp is much more complicated than udp

in practice this means that tcp is better suited for continuous transmission of data whereas the more lightweight udp can be used when reliability isn t important

there is a perception that udp is faster than tcp but i think it depends on the situation - take a look at this discussion for some further discussion on speed reliability etc between udp and tcp go down through all the high scored answers

and there are no handshakings required udp are pretty much faster but less reliable than tcp

please note however that this architecture implements tcp which is much slower than udp and will not work for any type of fast-paced data intensive games but should accomplish your goals given your description above

while udp has less network overhead than tcp it generally relies on you the developer to come up with your own mechanisms for flow control fragmentation handling lost packets etc.

i m aware of the differences in general the facts like tcp is more accurate while udp is more fast

the package is bigger than udp s package but smaller than tcp s package

with tcp its slightly slower than udp and has more features

generally speaking udp has less overhead than tcp allowing you to receive more data but this is not a strict rule and is almost negligible in this context

if you care a lot about efficiency or really need tens of thousands of connections then implementing your specific protocol in udp will always be better than tcp

in my experience udp based code is generally less complex than tcp based code

what is that key feature in tcp that makes it have much much higher throughput than udp

tcp - more reliable than udp but this comes with some overhead there is a distinct connection a better match for games which require less frequent data transmission such as turn based games as is your game

so assess the situation the development cost of a udp transport is higher to significantly higher than tcp and to some degree you are re-inventing tcp

as an additional note my suspicion is that you d need to indulge yourself in some pretty sophisticated benchmarks before you could conclude that udp is actually going to have higher performance than tcp for web services
