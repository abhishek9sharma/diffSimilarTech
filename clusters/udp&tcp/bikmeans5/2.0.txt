i am confused why tcp throughput is bigger than udp

udp is faster and requires less bandwidth than tcp

in doing so the tradefoff is that tcp becomes slower compared to udp

4 tcp is a slower than udp

what s currently baffling me is in my results tcp finishes almost 2x faster than udp

theoretically udp should be be 30-50 faster than tcp because it s missing the extra trip for the ack and has a smaller header overhead however in reality there are many cases where tcp would outperform udp just because of congestion control

udp has less overhead than tcp and is therefore faster

i was expecting that udp would be faster but tcp is on average two times faster than udp

the package is bigger than udp s package but smaller than tcp s package

with tcp its slightly slower than udp and has more features
