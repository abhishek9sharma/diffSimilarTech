certainly tcp has more overhead than udp

udp has a much lower overhead than tcp

udp communication requires much less overhead than tcp due to the number of messages exchanged

udp gives smaller latency with many many issues to discuss here of course tcp gives bigger latency

udp lends itself to real-time less latency than tcp

moreover tcp has more processing overhead than udp

udp just has a smaller overhead than tcp but that comes at the cost of reliability
