udp is more popular in nat punching because provides much better results than tcp

that among other things is why tcp is considered more reliable but slower than udp

udp protocol is unreliable but much much faster than tcp which is most commonly used for communication

as a general rule udp is faster than tcp due to less protocol overhead

in some applications tcp is faster better throughput than udp

udp is generally faster than tcp as it does not have to do the overhead checking of consistency that tcp must deal with

+ consider that the implementation of tcp stack is much more complicated than udp more instructions are executed there

most importantly you can easily supplement udp with some reliable delivery hand-shaking that s less overhead than tcp

if the network between the two point have a very high quality udp is absolutely faster than tcp but in some other case such as the gprs network tcp may been faster and more reliability than udp

tcp is much better than udp in terms of reliability

a udp stack is considerably simpler than a tcp stack

udp is way lighter and faster but somewhat less reliable than tcp

in gaming especially fpss udp tends to be the chosen protocol because it s much less chatty than tcp

udp scales better than tcp because of reduced states that need to be maintained in the operating system

but there are some cases especially in iot domain udp is more popular than tcp for its bigger transport overheads

tcp sockets- guaranteed delivery bigger payload than udp cumbersome to setup for web based solutions

actually we could say that tcp is a higher level protocol compared to udp because tcp includes some advanced features which might be useful .

udp will almost always provide better performance than tcp at the cost of reliability

also if you have very limited memory processing resources it is worth bearing in mind that udp is a less costly protocol as it avoids a lot of the overheads tcp incurs due to its inbuilt connection management

some protocols are more complex because what s needed are some but not all of the features of tcp but more than what udp provides

yes udp is much much lighter than tcp

if you re more interested in latency and small amounts of data then something udp based could be better than tcp but you d need to build extra logic for ordering the messages and retrying the lost ones

udp gives smaller latency with many many issues to discuss here of course tcp gives bigger latency

it was introduced since the nat traversal for tcp is much more complicated than udp

in practice this means that tcp is better suited for continuous transmission of data whereas the more lightweight udp can be used when reliability isn t important

there is a perception that udp is faster than tcp but i think it depends on the situation - take a look at this discussion for some further discussion on speed reliability etc between udp and tcp go down through all the high scored answers

and there are no handshakings required udp are pretty much faster but less reliable than tcp

please note however that this architecture implements tcp which is much slower than udp and will not work for any type of fast-paced data intensive games but should accomplish your goals given your description above

while udp has less network overhead than tcp it generally relies on you the developer to come up with your own mechanisms for flow control fragmentation handling lost packets etc.

i m aware of the differences in general the facts like tcp is more accurate while udp is more fast

the package is bigger than udp s package but smaller than tcp s package

with tcp its slightly slower than udp and has more features

generally speaking udp has less overhead than tcp allowing you to receive more data but this is not a strict rule and is almost negligible in this context

if you care a lot about efficiency or really need tens of thousands of connections then implementing your specific protocol in udp will always be better than tcp

in my experience udp based code is generally less complex than tcp based code

what is that key feature in tcp that makes it have much much higher throughput than udp

tcp - more reliable than udp but this comes with some overhead there is a distinct connection a better match for games which require less frequent data transmission such as turn based games as is your game

so assess the situation the development cost of a udp transport is higher to significantly higher than tcp and to some degree you are re-inventing tcp

as an additional note my suspicion is that you d need to indulge yourself in some pretty sophisticated benchmarks before you could conclude that udp is actually going to have higher performance than tcp for web services


1----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


udp is faster and requires less bandwidth than tcp

certainly tcp has more overhead than udp

udp has a much lower overhead than tcp

udp communication requires much less overhead than tcp due to the number of messages exchanged

udp lends itself to real-time less latency than tcp

moreover tcp has more processing overhead than udp

udp has less overhead than tcp and is therefore faster

udp just has a smaller overhead than tcp but that comes at the cost of reliability


2----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

in that sense reliable udp cannot be faster than tcp

the reason i asking this is because i read tcp is slower than udp because tcp ensures order of packets

tcp is a bit slower than udp but more failsafe

c++ is not my first language and this is small part of code i can t figure out i ve chosen udp because it is always much simpler than tcp

i did some research and found that udp may be more suitable in this case because udp hole punching works much better than tcp hole punching

tcp is far better at transferring large quantities of data but when the network fails it s more likely that udp will get through

tcp has to do a lot of error checking to ensure that your packets don t get dropped and so tcp is much slower than udp

i am confused why tcp throughput is bigger than udp

also see this other so answer about the misconception that udp is always faster than tcp

i assumend that the transmission using udp have to be much faster than using tcp but in fact my tests proved that the udp transmission is about 7 to 8 times slower than using tcp

from experience i can tell you udp is about 10-15 faster than tcp on dedicated and udp-tuned networks

the problem with using tcp is obviously that it is a lot slower than udp

udp is not always faster than tcp

maybe one of you guys already sees a problem in the code snippets or have any other suggestion or hint for me why my udp transmission is slower than tcp

i though that udp was faster than tcp but do you think that tcp will be faster due to the congestion

in doing so the tradefoff is that tcp becomes slower compared to udp

this was surprising for me as i expected udp to perform better than tcp

short answer if you can tolerance with any packet loss udp is better otherwise tcp

don t think of it as udp is faster and tcp is slower because that s just wrong

the downsides are that it is unreliable messages can be dropped or corrupted therefore you may want to add some safety and that some isp may restrict udp more than tcp test yourself to be sure but usually there is no problems

if the data is critical you should go for tcp which is slower as compared to udp which in fact doesn t guarantee the packets will arrive in order or even if they d arrive or not

4 tcp is a slower than udp

what s currently baffling me is in my results tcp finishes almost 2x faster than udp

note that udp is more difficult to work with than tcp because packets are not always guaranteed to be delivered

if your client connections are more or less permanent and not too many clients are connected at the same time tcp is only slightly worse than udp

if you can t afford lost packets then tcp is probably a better option than udp since it provides that guarantee out of the box

udp should be much faster than tcp because there are no acknowledge and congestion detection

i know udp is faster than tcp for various reason

this was surprising for me as it is well known fact that udp performs better than tcp

i suppose this is one of the reasons for the misconception that udp is slower than tcp

tldr tcp ip is more reliable than udp but not a 100 iron-clad guarantee that nothing will ever go wrong

udp is significantly faster than tcp and is why it is or was used for video and various things back in the day

i m trying to avoid tcpclient because udp is faster but would this work in tcp since it s streamed

the reason udp is faster than tcp is because there is no form of flow control or error correction

theoretically udp should be be 30-50 faster than tcp because it s missing the extra trip for the ack and has a smaller header overhead however in reality there are many cases where tcp would outperform udp just because of congestion control

this is the reason why udp is much faster than tcp

i know that in practice this would only happen with a great amount of connection given that processing time of an udp connection is faster than tcp but it could potentially happen

note that there are exceptions to the above - for example tcp generally traverses firewalls better than udp which may be blocked due to security to traffic policy reasons so voip speech may sometimes be sent over tcp for part of its journey at least

in a native application i would use udp for the most data player position ... because it s way faster than tcp and it s uncritical when it is lost

tcp as you know udp is faster than tcp even if udp may miss some

btw i concur that udp is far more appropriate than tcp in this case

tcp is much slower than udp but when the two machines are not on the same lan udp is not reliable

udp is actually expected to work better than tcp in lossy networks or congested networks

tcp is certainly going to be more reliable than udp since udp doesn t guarantee packet delivery which is probably why you application is hanging on the receive

i was expecting that udp would be faster but tcp is on average two times faster than udp

i don t think you should make the assumption that udp is faster than tcp

because there is no confirmation on udp packets it s slightly faster than tcp

you ve struck lucky with the requirements - because you re going from udp - tcp it s actually a lot simpler than doing udp - udp

since loosing some packets doesn t matter but speed latency is crucial udp is much better than tcp

tcp is slower assures data arrival udp is faster data corruption may be possible

tcp mounts are more reliable and you know you have a network problem much faster than with udp

at my company we have found memory mapped files to be much faster than loopback tcp ip for communication on the same box so i m assuming it would be faster than udp too

if you were attempting to beat the performance of tcp by shifting to udp keep in mind that part of the reason you get lower performance with tcp is because tcp tracks and redelivers the lost packets for you

i used iperf on two linux machines to send data using both udp and tcp i found that tcp performs better than udp average 65 better

instead you can use udp and implement your own scheme for verification of data that is less stringent than tcp

udp is extremely faster than tcp which is suitable to stream a user s voice input

hello to all i am developing an application that needs to send a image via the udp socket.i know that tcp is a better protocol but playing with kryonet in java i have learnt that udp is better for this type of application.i have this small class that i have made

use socket for tcp and datagram for udp its a lot faster than tcp but less connection oriented

for instance zeromq can leverage udp multicast to run faster than any tcp protocol but the application programmer doesn t need to learn a new api

tcp is slower than udp and you ll have to mitigate that in realtime multiplayer

also sending receiving data over udp is much simpler than over tcp and it does not require any connections

for this particular application sending simple data chunk to the client from an index given by the client tcp will not perform any better than udp

or is there any specific scenario where udp is better than tcp

udp is also more work than tcp if you need reliability which is built in to tcp

what i have thought of so far is that tcp is going to be more reliable than udp and in rmi corba we want network reliability

2 tcp needs more processing at network interface level where as in udp itâ s not

a heartbeat is by nature a connectionless contrivance so it goes that udp connectionless is more relevant here than tcp connection-oriented

udp is quicker than tcp but if you re using quickfix you ll be using tcp

when writing your server bear in mind that the sequence of events for a tcp socket is much harder than for a udp socket since as well as the normal socket and bind calls you also have to listen and accept

tcp streaming for audio can be less helpful than udp rtp as you d have to turn off nagling

tcp socket is even more likely than udp socket but both work

if i d directly say that udp is faster comparatively than tcp that it is used for such applications

if you can do everything with udp it is lighter than tcp

-- in which scenario configuration would i get udp to perform better than tcp

we know tcp is better suited for this but the hardware development decided it s got to be udp

tcp ip is supposed to be more reliable than udp ip see this comparison

does udp always perform better than tcp

i think udp will perform better than tcp gcdasyncsocket in your case video transfer

we propose to use udp over tcp since udp is faster than tcp

but it sounds like you want to do nat traversal over tcp which is a harder problem than udp

scenario where udp is better than tcp

you can use udp as well but if you are dealing with firewalls it is probably going to be simpler with tcp

udp is less reliable on a wide area network but in a closed environment of a vm talking to its host you can safely skip all the tcp reliability stuff

i was going through internet and so and understood that web sockets are encapsulations to tcp which by itself is slower than udp ofcourse at the cost of reliability but i couldnt find much info if websockets or udp would be ideal to implement such a server

but with the udp protocol in particular this is easier than for tcp

tcp is reliable but slower than udp while udp is not safe and i have to implement my own fault-handling codes

if they are connected over the internet you could try to use the examples for tcp but tcp has more overhead than udp

it may be that the kernel heuristics for servering tcp connections is more aggressive than for udp sockets since tcp connections require more state and more continuous processing than do udp sockets

http is an application layer protocol which could be encapsulated with a protocol that uses udp providing arguably faster reliable communication than tcp

udp is simpler protocol than tcp and you can still simulate features of tcp using udp

in general the tcp protocol manages the available network bandwidth better than the udp protocol

udp port scanning is possible but it is harder than tcp scanning

tcp is way better then udp for that

you could get them to do a udp multicast within a lan environment to identify the programs using protocol messages then have a stored cache of each other s identity and then use tcp to connect and do main exchanging of messages which is more reliable than udp

tcp is a slower more reliable protocol than udp is

normally a server wouldn t need to know the client s address beforehand but udp s knottier than tcp the more usual stream-oriented approach to socket communication in many ways

i know tcp is better to send file but i have a homework about sending file via udp protocol

but when i used iperf on two linux machines to send data using both udp and tcp i found that tcp performs better than udp for 10mb of data

because of tcp requires connection and provides security it is slower than udp and therefore it should not be preffered during a video streaming

the decision on yours the tcp protocol used for connection oriented network that is more secure than udp

for some requirements tcp is better for some udp

it seems like udp will more efficient than tcp

alternatively it can be used over udp which is less hungry than tcp

the key question was related to what kind of situations would udp be the better choice over tcp

instead of implementing all these over udp it is much better just to switch to tcp

udp is much faster then tcp but tcp has flow control and guaranteed delivery

apart from that tcp packets by themselves are not slower than udp packets and data transfer with a simple tcp connection can be faster than with a simple udp connection because flow control and reliable transfer is already integrated and you don t have to reinvent everything again and often worse

as such traversing a nat through udp is much easier than tcp

keep in mind that implementing udp traversal is easier than tcp

also note that it is easy to implement your own stack on top of udp that performs worse than tcp

it is worth nothing that in a link where udp and tcp are sharing the bandwidth tcp is better behaved than udp in that it will try to limit itself to avoid congestion

udp is significantly easier do you really need tcp btw

tcp windowing is more expensive than raw udp but if you use udp to go faster and add a custom loss-recovery or seqno ack resend manager then that may slow you down again

first of udp s datagram is simpler than tcp s one

i ve considered that udp is more suitable for sending a series of discrete data sets but i need the reliability of tcp

-- does udp always perform better than tcp

udp communication is connection less as compared to tcp which need a connection


4----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

the problem is that tcp creates bigger packages of data while udp uses 8 kb of data blocks

why the header size of udp is less than tcp

you will notice that the tcp header has more fields than the udp header and many of those fields will be populated by information from the handshake

udp packets are easier structured than tcp packets but sacrifice security for their size

udp sockets have much lower overhead than tcp because packets are not acknowledged by the recipient

as far as tcp goes i think tcp is more generally used protocol for more data-centric requests like chat or things that require packet integrity udp tolerates packet loss to lower latency

udp is more of a fire and forget whereas tcp maintains a connection state

getting much more information is needed in the packet header for connection less like udp but why the header size of udp is less than tcp

like matzi suggested udp gives you lower latency and lower packet overhead as the header is smaller than tcp but on the downside the delivery of the packet to the destination is never guaranteed ie

tcp is subject to higher latencies than udp as it requires the client to send back packet confirmations

udp is faster than tcp because packets are sent without guarantee of delivery nor order

in a congested network yes udp will send its packets faster than tcp this is because tcp takes then congestion into account using a mechanism called congestion control

for example i read an experiment in which a stream of 300 byte packets was being sent over ethernet 1500 byte mtu and tcp was 50 faster than udp

one can say udp has a lower overhead than tcp because its packets have a smaller header and therefore take less bandwidth to send the payload the data

also remember that dns requests can use tcp if the request or response would need more than 1 udp packet

tcp has bigger overhead than udp because it needs to add more data to your payload but you are guaranteed that your data will be received in it s destination in the order you sent it and not corrupted

i am using udp because it is much faster than tcp but sometimes i need the know for sure if the packet reached to the other side in my program i can not use tcp at all so i am sending ack packets

for example tcp has much more flags window-length syn ack etc - and also starts and ends a connection in a very stable way - the three way handshake - while all udp has is source ip dest ip length source port dest port and checksum

is sending packets via an established tcp connection after all hand shaking has been done a method to be faster than udp

udp is connection less but at the same level as tcp

one often finds the argument that udp is faster then tcp

i read in a case where a stream of 300 byte packets was being sent over ethernet 1500 byte mtu and tcp was 50 faster than udp

udp is really faster than tcp and the simple reason is because it s non-existent acknowledge packet ack that permits a continuous packet stream instead of tcp that acknowledges a set of packets calculatd by using the tcp window size and round-trip time rtt .

only when packets can be discarded unordered can udp be faster than tcp

try to increase timeout value tcp is slower than udp

i know tcp is a safer choice but let s assume i can only use udp and i need to ensure i can send packets over at a high rate with no missing packets what should i do

the fact that udp s header size is less than tcp s is because is a simpler protocol that needs less header space that s all there is to it

udp is faster than tcp and the simple reason is because its nonexistent acknowledge packet ack that permits a continuous packet stream instead of tcp that acknowledges a set of packets calculated by using the tcp window size and round-trip time rtt
