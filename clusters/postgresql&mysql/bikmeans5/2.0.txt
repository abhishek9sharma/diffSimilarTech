mysql is probably more often offered by shared hosting providers postgresql is probably a little more powerful

while postgresql is less popular than mysql most of the serious web hosting supports it

i suggest postgresql it s more capable has more features and better support for complex queries and datatypes than mysql and has a lot of tuning options

postgresql is much more complete and solid and will much better support complex queries and their optimization while mysql may shine in terms of retrieval speed for extremely simple queries

postgresql is far more powerful and scalable and doesn t have mysql s silly limitations and gotchas

postgresql requires more tuning than mysql to achieve optimal performance

there are workloads where postgresql is better and there are workloads where mysql is better

mysql is more widely supported and a little easier to use but postgresql has some very cool features and functionality that s worth taking a gander at
