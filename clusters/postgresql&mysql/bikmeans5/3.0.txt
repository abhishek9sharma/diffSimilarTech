anyways mysql is bad and on longterm especially if you are enough good for java i suggest you to use some better db with postgresql you were really satisfied i think

for these ultra simple queries postgresql can be slower than mysql - postgresql has richer planner that works better on more complex queries but on trivial queries is slower

i d have said that postgresql is more security aware than mysql supporting roles more authentication methods ... but that the database itself has generally a very limited impact on the security of an application

not only does postgresql have a far more flexible indexing than mysql but the table approaches are very different also meaning the appropriate indexing strategies are as different as the tactics are

i hear postgresql is more robust and doesn t crash like mysql does in these situations

traditionally postgresql has had fewer security issues than mysql but they are both doing very well on that

mysql is not less complicated that postgresql -- they re the same thing

i also personally believe that postgresql has better handling of complex queries that include sub-selects and the like which most mysql users used to avoid

with correct locking for safety reasons and heavy concurrent use postgresql performed better than mysql

given postgresql s reputation for doing things better than mysql or at least as good as i daresay that postgresql would demonstrate similar performance if properly used

this is a weak point that iirc postgresql can handle better but with mysql you have to work around that by reverting the changes yourself in case of rollbacks

some people were saying that postgresql is better for security purposes whereas mysql is becoming more feature rich.

however postgresql s sql features are far more advanced than mysql s and mysql has a tendency to silently ignore things you tell it to do - especially in a default installation and if you rely on a foreign key to be created that might be a very unpleasant surprise

from how i understand it postgresql is a more correct database implementation while mysql is less correct less compliant but faster

some say mysql is much better for bigger projects while others think just go with postgresql

as for reliability i think that postgresql is more reliable especially when compared to mysql using myisam - innodb is a lot better here

though mysql is more popular than postgresql but instagram is using postgresql maybe due to these reasons
