i did a simple performance test and i noticed postgresql is slower than mysql

fyi postgresql scales better than mysql on multi-processor overlapping requests from a review i was reading a few months back sorry no link

postgresql seem to better than mysql in terms of speed

i ve found that postgresql is in my expirience is slower as mysql

i just recently switched databases to postgresql which has given me a slew of problems although i must admit i like it a lot better than mysql

while mysql is more famous for serious enterprise-quality database where preserving your data is critical i recommend postgresql

postgresql is already slower than mysql up to a certain point it is actually faster when you have a ridiculously large database

unfortunately in postgresql select count is often slower than mysql to which it often get s compared to

postgresql specifically has gotten easier to manage while mysql has lost some of the simplicity that gave it an advantage without picking up enough features that really matter

mysql i am told can be optimized to do faster reads than postgresql but both are pretty ridiculously fast in terms of # transactions sec they support and it doesn t sound like that s your problem

this is ancedotal but the postgresql servers i ve managed have always been much less troublesome than mysql which likes to randomly crash once in a while occasionally corrupting a table on the way down

and postgresql has fewer experienced administrators than the big databases and mysql which i believe contributes to the reputation

the only reason i was considering postgresql was that some research suggested postgresql has much better support for changing schemas along the way than mysql

some recent tests we did showed that postgresql does perform faster than mysql and we believe the table partitioning feature in postgresql will be very important with a table in our database we foresee to grow into 100 million rows and more in production

postgresql gets much better performance and this is coming from a former mysql partisan

in most regards postgresql is slower than mysql especially when it comes to fine tuning in the end

mysql s version is apparently marginally faster than postgresql but lacks some of the more advanced spatial features therefore it s pretty much limited to finding records that match a certain range of coordinates

i did some benchmarking 3 years ago may be stale... which showed that on large datasets basically postgresql fulltext is 10-100x faster than mysql and xapian 10-100x faster than postgresql but not integrated

while mysql has a larger user base postgresql is gaining more an more popularity ever since implementing several crucial features that were missing in earlier versions

according to my own experience postgresql run much faster than mysql especially handling big tables 1.4 gb lineitem table in my case
