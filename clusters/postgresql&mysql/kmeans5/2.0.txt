do you find rails with postgresql is slower than mysql knowing that it produce more query on the background

i did a simple performance test and i noticed postgresql is slower than mysql

i had mentioned that in our rails application all select queries dropped below 100ms after switching to postgresql whereas some of the complex joins generated by activerecord would occasionally take as much as 15s or more with mysql 5.1 because of nested loops with inner table scans even when indices were available

does this affect postgresql harder than mysql

i ve found that postgresql is in my expirience is slower as mysql

mysql mariadb is slightly worse than postgresql

mysql run 4x faster than postgresql

postgresql is already slower than mysql up to a certain point it is actually faster when you have a ridiculously large database

unfortunately in postgresql select count is often slower than mysql to which it often get s compared to

postgresql is faster than mysql s innodb

i wonder why postgresql s single insert statement is completely faster than mysql s when autocommit is turned on

may be postgresql takes less time than mysql

i just checked the timings using mysql 5 and they are slightly worse than postgresql
