fyi postgresql scales better than mysql on multi-processor overlapping requests from a review i was reading a few months back sorry no link

mysql is probably more often offered by shared hosting providers postgresql is probably a little more powerful

i hear postgresql is more robust and doesn t crash like mysql does in these situations

while postgresql is less popular than mysql most of the serious web hosting supports it

traditionally postgresql has had fewer security issues than mysql but they are both doing very well on that

i would recommend postgresql for a beginner as it has far fewer surprises than mysql

i just recently switched databases to postgresql which has given me a slew of problems although i must admit i like it a lot better than mysql

postgresql supports some more security features than mysql for example integration with gssapi or kerberos for logins last i checked mysql didn t have these

postgresql has more established support for this but mysql has played catch up in the last year or so and has a working method of this in the latest versions

postgresql is far more powerful and scalable and doesn t have mysql s silly limitations and gotchas

while mysql is more famous for serious enterprise-quality database where preserving your data is critical i recommend postgresql

postgresql specifically has gotten easier to manage while mysql has lost some of the simplicity that gave it an advantage without picking up enough features that really matter

mysql i am told can be optimized to do faster reads than postgresql but both are pretty ridiculously fast in terms of # transactions sec they support and it doesn t sound like that s your problem

this is ancedotal but the postgresql servers i ve managed have always been much less troublesome than mysql which likes to randomly crash once in a while occasionally corrupting a table on the way down

some people were saying that postgresql is better for security purposes whereas mysql is becoming more feature rich.

and postgresql has fewer experienced administrators than the big databases and mysql which i believe contributes to the reputation

the only reason i was considering postgresql was that some research suggested postgresql has much better support for changing schemas along the way than mysql

some recent tests we did showed that postgresql does perform faster than mysql and we believe the table partitioning feature in postgresql will be very important with a table in our database we foresee to grow into 100 million rows and more in production

postgresql gets much better performance and this is coming from a former mysql partisan

in most regards postgresql is slower than mysql especially when it comes to fine tuning in the end

i did some benchmarking 3 years ago may be stale... which showed that on large datasets basically postgresql fulltext is 10-100x faster than mysql and xapian 10-100x faster than postgresql but not integrated

while mysql has a larger user base postgresql is gaining more an more popularity ever since implementing several crucial features that were missing in earlier versions

some say mysql is much better for bigger projects while others think just go with postgresql

according to my own experience postgresql run much faster than mysql especially handling big tables 1.4 gb lineitem table in my case

postgresql is worth learning and much more advanced than mysql

mysql is more widely supported and a little easier to use but postgresql has some very cool features and functionality that s worth taking a gander at
