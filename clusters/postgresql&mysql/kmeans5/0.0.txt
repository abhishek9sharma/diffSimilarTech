either postgresql more proven than mysql for such huge data

postgresql is a bit more restrictive than mysql

it seems mysql is more forgiving with this than postgresql but in every case you use a reserved word you should escape it

i d have said that postgresql is more security aware than mysql supporting roles more authentication methods ... but that the database itself has generally a very limited impact on the security of an application

not only does postgresql have a far more flexible indexing than mysql but the table approaches are very different also meaning the appropriate indexing strategies are as different as the tactics are

postgresql is more compliant but if you re comfortable with mysql and you re using an orm you should probably use that

generally speaking i find postgresql lends itself to 24 7 operations better than mysql

in other words is mysql better or worse than postgresql to handle unicode etc

all that said postgresql is much more acid compliant than mysql it handles fks just as you re needing and i would generally recommend it based on what you ve expressed in your post

the question is is mysql somehow more resistant than postgresql to sql injection attack under the perl dbi and why might this be the case

i am using postgresql btw which can do more than mysql incase that changes things

postgresql is also a lot better imo than mysql and is the recommended database to use with django according to a lot of the people close to django

mysql is not less complicated that postgresql -- they re the same thing

it s a shame postgresql isn t more popular than mysql since it supports exactly this feature out-of-the-box you d only have to share one sequence object between tables.

with correct locking for safety reasons and heavy concurrent use postgresql performed better than mysql

i suggest postgresql it s more capable has more features and better support for complex queries and datatypes than mysql and has a lot of tuning options

i totally understand the error and assume that the mysql implementation is less sql conform than the postgresql implementation

does that mean perhaps rails team favor postgresql slightly more than mysql

now i m not sure if i d say postgresql is generally better than mysql -- there are certainly things that mysql does much better and so it certainly has its uses -- but these are a few things i absolutely love about it

this is a weak point that iirc postgresql can handle better but with mysql you have to work around that by reverting the changes yourself in case of rollbacks

in fact this presentation which still refers to an older incomplete version of mysql s opengis support suggests that with proper indexing some mysql geospatial actions may actually perform better than postgresql postgis though i m sure that s up for debate

i am aware that postgresql interpretation of the sql standard is stricter than mysql and that consequently this type of query won t work...and have read a number of posts on stackoverflow and elsewhere on the subject - but none of them seem to be the definitive answer on this subject

however postgresql s sql features are far more advanced than mysql s and mysql has a tendency to silently ignore things you tell it to do - especially in a default installation and if you rely on a foreign key to be created that might be a very unpleasant surprise

postgresql is stricter about conversions than mysql is and generally will throw an error rather than try to convert a string to an integer if it doesn t look like one

postgresql will always be a little bit more mature than mysql

from how i understand it postgresql is a more correct database implementation while mysql is less correct less compliant but faster

postgresql is a little more strict than mysql about type conversion and does not let you implicitly cast convert between numbers and strings

i know postgresql could be considered more mature than mysql with regards to locking thanks to mvcc - can i use row-locking or some other feature in postgresql instead of the token field

why postgresql is more capable than others mysql etc. on django
