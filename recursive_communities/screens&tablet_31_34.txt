smaller, mobile, desktop, ---------------------------------------------------

320dp,phone,smaller,720dp,pixel,larger
that hopefully explains why a typical 320dp phone screens is always smaller than a 720dp tablet screens although the smaller screens can have more pixel than the larger

issue,phone,height,landscape,mode,pc
the issue is that the phone screens height in landscape mode is likely much less than a tablet or pc

screensizes,wide,smaller,smartphone,open
twitter desktop accomodates screensizes from around 1048px wide when you are on a screens that is smaller then that you are probably on a tablet or smartphone and if you open twitter from a browser on your phone you are instantly redirected to and prompted to download the twitter app

wider,responsive,smaller,size
when viewed on a screens wider than a tablet to be responsive according to the smaller screens size like this

size,smaller,mobile,example
for example when the screens size becomes smaller to a tablet or mobile you could do this as an example

small,tableth,centimeter,pone
they are for example too big in a phone and too small in a tableth because the screens of tablet has more centimeter than the pone screens

properties,mobile,wider,desktop,css
you could make your css mobile-first meaning that all properties are optimized for mobile then as the screens gets wider you apply tablet and desktop optimized css for elements

width,smaller,version,mobile
this will only be added if the screens width is smaller than 480px else the tablet version would show the mobile version

computer,full,mode,smaller,phone,size,divs
this only happens when the window is on a computer in full screens mode but when the screens is made smaller to a phone tablet size the divs function how they should

splitactionbar,phones,size,smaller,space,bottom
splitactionbar works only on phones because the screens size is much smaller than tablet and it takes space at the bottom for extra space for your action items

desktop,devices,phones,width,page
i have been working on this page that works fine in desktop devices and tablet but not on phones because the width of the page is more than the screens width i need to make this width responsive to have the page with height-only scroll

display,none,width,larger,size,time
in my actual code i ve set the display to none if the screens width is larger than tablet size because that s the only time i feel like i need the button

smaller
the screens is much smaller so you can not present your app the same way as you can on a tablet

phone,width,viewport
on a tablet or phone which may have less than 750px screens width it will go off the viewport

number,giant,smaller,small,laptops
however the number of people using these giant tablet is much smaller than the number of people with small screens laptops

understanding,size,smaller,desktop,area,visible
based on my understanding i hope that is because the size of the tablet screens which is smaller than the desktop that makes the strokes to get hidden inside the area that was not visible on the tablet however the area is visible in desktop

title,tabs,smaller,iphone
what i would like to do is use css media queries to have the title be above the tabs when the screens gets smaller or on a tablet or iphone

text,left,smaller,phone
inside the container i have a panel with the text set to left but when the screens gets smaller then a tablet to something like a phone i want the text in the panel to center

links,mobile,size,bigger,desktop
my aim is to use a bootstrap 3 dropdown to display links at mobile screens size and use a list to display the same links when the screens is bigger desktop and tablet size

pixels, resolution, higher, ---------------------------------------------------

lower,density,pixels
this is because that tablet often has a lower density of screens pixels

resolution,higher,i.e,col-md
screens resolution i.e higher than tablet i.e col-md and col-lg in bootstrap language should only cover 11 grid with offset of 1

higher,resolution,phone,pixels,dots,dpi
i know that obviously a tablet has a higher screens resolution than a phone because it has more pixels dots on the screens from what ive been reading tablet also have a higher dpi dots per inch than phones as well

green, background, yellow, ---------------------------------------------------

bigger,green,background,yellow
if the screens is bigger than 1024px it should be green my tablet screens is but the background stays yellow

bigger,child,views
this tablet has a bigger screens yet is still showing only 2 child views in the row

size, resolution, higher, ---------------------------------------------------

different,ones,size,reasonable,bigger,margins,mix,res
having different ones based upon screens size is reasonable bigger margins on tablet though the mix then would be something like res values dimens.xml and res values-sw720dp values.xml

contrast,nexus,higher,actual,resolution,ipad,page,smaller,size
by contrast a nexus 7 tablet has higher actual screens resolution than an ipad mini but it reports to your web page a smaller screens size

grid,width,resolution,population,media,queries,size,smaller,phones
basically my layout has 1200px grid width but i figured that there will be a problem with 1024px screens resolution 20 of the population bla bla so i created media queries when the screens size is smaller than 1199px the grid to change its width to 960px and so on for tablet phones etc..

size,devices,note,huge,phones,higher,resolution,dpi
i can t use screens size because of devices like galaxy note with huge screens and some phones have higher resolution than some tablet same with dpi i think

available, space, fonts, ---------------------------------------------------

fonts,space,available
you will also notice that the fonts are not scaling as the 7 tablet simply has more screens space available vs the 4 phone

space,available,room,developers
it simply comes down to the space available a tablet gives more room to developers thus allowing developers to put more on one screens

space,phone
a tablet offers more screens space than a phone

other---------------------------------------------------

device,mobile,use,criteria,diagonal,greater,iches
to determine device is tablet or mobile i use criteria if device s screens diagonal is greater than 7 iches the device is tablet

larger,standard,detachable,keyboards,space,browsers,users,sites
in fact when a tablet has a larger than standard screens size the tablet with detachable keyboards available these days mobile versions of the site can look over-optimised for space which is the reason why browsers allow tablet users to opt to display sites in desktop mode

example,android,stock,player,feature,full
as an example my android tablet s stock video player app has a feature that allows it to be less than full screens
