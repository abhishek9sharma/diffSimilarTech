udp will almost always provide better performance than tcp at the cost of reliability

better,reliability
tcp is much better than udp in terms of reliability

tcp is far better at transferring large quantities of data but when the network fails it s more likely that udp will get through

better
instead of implementing all these over udp it is much better just to switch to tcp

surprising,better
this was surprising for me as i expected udp to perform better than tcp

lower,overhead
udp has a much lower overhead than tcp

smaller,overhead,cost,reliability
udp just has a smaller overhead than tcp but that comes at the cost of reliability

tcp has bigger overhead than udp because it needs to add more data to your payload but you are guaranteed that your data will be received in it s destination in the order you sent it and not corrupted

sockets,lower,overhead,packets,recipient
udp sockets have much lower overhead than tcp because packets are not acknowledged by the recipient

overhead,data,strict
generally speaking udp has less overhead than tcp allowing you to receive more data but this is not a strict rule and is almost negligible in this context

tcp is slower assures data arrival udp is faster data corruption may be possible

faster,various,things
udp is significantly faster than tcp and is why it is or was used for video and various things back in the day

tradefoff,slower
in doing so the tradefoff is that tcp becomes slower compared to udp

things,reliable,slower
that among other things is why tcp is considered more reliable but slower than udp

the reason udp is faster than tcp is because there is no form of flow control or error correction

faster
tcp as you know udp is faster than tcp even if udp may miss some

timeout,value,slower
try to increase timeout value tcp is slower than udp

reliable,guarantee,packet
tcp is certainly going to be more reliable than udp since udp doesn t guarantee packet delivery which is probably why you application is hanging on the receive

faster
this is the reason why udp is much faster than tcp

faster,average
i was expecting that udp would be faster but tcp is on average two times faster than udp

faster
udp is not always faster than tcp

faster,packets,guarantee
udp is faster than tcp because packets are sent without guarantee of delivery nor order

tcpclient,faster,work
i m trying to avoid tcpclient because udp is faster but would this work in tcp since it s streamed

udp has less overhead than tcp and is therefore faster

sense,reliable,cannot,faster
in that sense reliable udp cannot be faster than tcp

slower
4 tcp is a slower than udp

faster,various
i know udp is faster than tcp for various reason

results,finishes,faster
what s currently baffling me is in my results tcp finishes almost 2x faster than udp

faster,applications
if i d directly say that udp is faster comparatively than tcp that it is used for such applications

error,packets,slower
tcp has to do a lot of error checking to ensure that your packets don t get dropped and so tcp is much slower than udp

slower
the problem with using tcp is obviously that it is a lot slower than udp

argument,faster
one often finds the argument that udp is faster then tcp

reliable,delivery,hand-shaking,overhead
most importantly you can easily supplement udp with some reliable delivery hand-shaking that s less overhead than tcp

faster, packets, connection, ---------------------------------------------------

faster,packet,side,program,ack,packets
i am using udp because it is much faster than tcp but sometimes i need the know for sure if the packet reached to the other side in my program i can not use tcp at all so i am sending ack packets

faster,loopback,ip,communication,box
at my company we have found memory mapped files to be much faster than loopback tcp ip for communication on the same box so i m assuming it would be faster than udp too

data,critical,slower,packets,order
if the data is critical you should go for tcp which is slower as compared to udp which in fact doesn t guarantee the packets will arrive in order or even if they d arrive or not

congested,network,packets,faster,congestion,account
in a congested network yes udp will send its packets faster than tcp this is because tcp takes then congestion into account using a mechanism called congestion control

packets,established,connection,hand,method,faster
is sending packets via an established tcp connection after all hand shaking has been done a method to be faster than udp

use,socket,datagram,faster,connection
use socket for tcp and datagram for udp its a lot faster than tcp but less connection oriented

zeromq,leverage,multicast,faster,protocol,application
for instance zeromq can leverage udp multicast to run faster than any tcp protocol but the application programmer doesn t need to learn a new api

simpler, protocol, firewalls, ---------------------------------------------------

size,simpler,protocol
the fact that udp s header size is less than tcp s is because is a simpler protocol that needs less header space that s all there is to it

firewalls,simpler
you can use udp as well but if you are dealing with firewalls it is probably going to be simpler with tcp

simpler,protocol,features
udp is simpler protocol than tcp and you can still simulate features of tcp using udp

part,figure,simpler
c++ is not my first language and this is small part of code i can t figure out i ve chosen udp because it is always much simpler than tcp

data,simpler,connections
also sending receiving data over udp is much simpler than over tcp and it does not require any connections

protocol,particular,easier
but with the udp protocol in particular this is easier than for tcp

bigger,packages,data,kb
the problem is that tcp creates bigger packages of data while udp uses 8 kb of data blocks

gaming,fpss,protocol,chatty
in gaming especially fpss udp tends to be the chosen protocol because it s much less chatty than tcp

lucky,requirements,simpler
you ve struck lucky with the requirements - because you re going from udp - tcp it s actually a lot simpler than doing udp - udp

higher, subject, latencies, ---------------------------------------------------

subject,higher,latencies,client,packet
tcp is subject to higher latencies than udp as it requires the client to send back packet confirmations

development,cost,transport,higher,degree
so assess the situation the development cost of a udp transport is higher to significantly higher than tcp and to some degree you are re-inventing tcp

performance, sophisticated, benchmarks, ---------------------------------------------------

sophisticated,benchmarks,higher,performance,web,services
as an additional note my suspicion is that you d need to indulge yourself in some pretty sophisticated benchmarks before you could conclude that udp is actually going to have higher performance than tcp for web services

performance,part,lower,tracks,redelivers
if you were attempting to beat the performance of tcp by shifting to udp keep in mind that part of the reason you get lower performance with tcp is because tcp tracks and redelivers the lost packets for you

work, likely, socket, ---------------------------------------------------

socket,likely,work
tcp socket is even more likely than udp socket but both work

work,reliability
udp is also more work than tcp if you need reliability which is built in to tcp

bigger, smaller, package, ---------------------------------------------------

package,bigger,smaller
the package is bigger than udp s package but smaller than tcp s package

throughput,bigger
i am confused why tcp throughput is bigger than udp

smaller,latency,issues,bigger
udp gives smaller latency with many many issues to discuss here of course tcp gives bigger latency

bigger, guaranteed, cumbersome, ---------------------------------------------------

sockets-,guaranteed,bigger,payload,cumbersome,web
tcp sockets- guaranteed delivery bigger payload than udp cumbersome to setup for web based solutions

iot,domain,popular,bigger,transport
but there are some cases especially in iot domain udp is more popular than tcp for its bigger transport overheads

simple, faster, set, ---------------------------------------------------

packets,slower,data,transfer,simple,connection,faster,flow
apart from that tcp packets by themselves are not slower than udp packets and data transfer with a simple tcp connection can be faster than with a simple udp connection because flow control and reliable transfer is already integrated and you don t have to reinvent everything again and often worse

native,application,data,player,position,faster,uncritical
in a native application i would use udp for the most data player position ... because it s way faster than tcp and it s uncritical when it is lost

faster,simple,non-existent,packet,stream,set,packets,window,size
udp is really faster than tcp and the simple reason is because it s non-existent acknowledge packet ack that permits a continuous packet stream instead of tcp that acknowledges a set of packets calculatd by using the tcp window size and round-trip time rtt .

faster,simple,nonexistent,packet,stream,set,packets,window,size
udp is faster than tcp and the simple reason is because its nonexistent acknowledge packet ack that permits a continuous packet stream instead of tcp that acknowledges a set of packets calculated by using the tcp window size and round-trip time rtt

high, faster, reliability, ---------------------------------------------------

perception,faster,situation,look,speed,reliability,high,answers
there is a perception that udp is faster than tcp but i think it depends on the situation - take a look at this discussion for some further discussion on speed reliability etc between udp and tcp go down through all the high scored answers

high,quality,faster,gprs,network,reliability
if the network between the two point have a very high quality udp is absolutely faster than tcp but in some other case such as the gprs network tcp may been faster and more reliability than udp

complex, implementation, instructions, ---------------------------------------------------

complex,features
some protocols are more complex because what s needed are some but not all of the features of tcp but more than what udp provides

complex
in my experience udp based code is generally less complex than tcp based code

implementation,complicated,instructions
+ consider that the implementation of tcp stack is much more complicated than udp more instructions are executed there

header, connection, size, ---------------------------------------------------

header,size
why the header size of udp is less than tcp

communication,connection
udp communication is connection less as compared to tcp which need a connection

header,fields
you will notice that the tcp header has more fields than the udp header and many of those fields will be populated by information from the handshake

fire,connection,state
udp is more of a fire and forget whereas tcp maintains a connection state

connection,level
udp is connection less but at the same level as tcp

header,connection,size
getting much more information is needed in the packet header for connection less like udp but why the header size of udp is less than tcp

harder, sequence, events, ---------------------------------------------------

sequence,events,socket,harder,normal
when writing your server bear in mind that the sequence of events for a tcp socket is much harder than for a udp socket since as well as the normal socket and bind calls you also have to listen and accept

port,scanning,possible,harder
udp port scanning is possible but it is harder than tcp scanning

other---------------------------------------------------

amounts,data,better,need,extra
if you re more interested in latency and small amounts of data then something udp based could be better than tcp but you d need to build extra logic for ordering the messages and retrying the lost ones

efficient
it seems like udp will more efficient than tcp

application,image,socket.i,better,protocol,kryonet,type
hello to all i am developing an application that needs to send a image via the udp socket.i know that tcp is a better protocol but playing with kryonet in java i have learnt that udp is better for this type of application.i have this small class that i have made

kernel,heuristics,connections,aggressive,sockets,state,continuous,processing
it may be that the kernel heuristics for servering tcp connections is more aggressive than for udp sockets since tcp connections require more state and more continuous processing than do udp sockets

general,rule,faster,protocol,overhead
as a general rule udp is faster than tcp due to less protocol overhead

protocol,data-centric,packet,integrity,loss
as far as tcp goes i think tcp is more generally used protocol for more data-centric requests like chat or things that require packet integrity udp tolerates packet loss to lower latency

matzi,lower,latency,header,smaller,downside,delivery
like matzi suggested udp gives you lower latency and lower packet overhead as the header is smaller than tcp but on the downside the delivery of the packet to the destination is never guaranteed ie

safety,isp,test,problems
the downsides are that it is unreliable messages can be dropped or corrupted therefore you may want to add some safety and that some isp may restrict udp more than tcp test yourself to be sure but usually there is no problems

client,address,knottier,usual,stream-oriented
normally a server wouldn t need to know the client s address beforehand but udp s knottier than tcp the more usual stream-oriented approach to socket communication in many ways

dns,requests,request,response,packet
also remember that dns requests can use tcp if the request or response would need more than 1 udp packet

tldr,ip,reliable,iron-clad,guarantee
tldr tcp ip is more reliable than udp but not a 100 iron-clad guarantee that nothing will ever go wrong

processing,network,interface,level,itâ
2 tcp needs more processing at network interface level where as in udp itâ s not

streaming,audio,helpful,rtp,nagling
tcp streaming for audio can be less helpful than udp rtp as you d have to turn off nagling

lower,overhead,packets,smaller
one can say udp has a lower overhead than tcp because its packets have a smaller header and therefore take less bandwidth to send the payload the data

packets,easier,structured,security
udp packets are easier structured than tcp packets but sacrifice security for their size

flags,window-length,stable,handshake,source,ip
for example tcp has much more flags window-length syn ack etc - and also starts and ends a connection in a very stable way - the three way handshake - while all udp has is source ip dest ip length source port dest port and checksum

multicast,lan,cache,identity,main,reliable
you could get them to do a udp multicast within a lan environment to identify the programs using protocol messages then have a stored cache of each other s identity and then use tcp to connect and do main exchanging of messages which is more reliable than udp

higher,level,protocol,advanced,features
actually we could say that tcp is a higher level protocol compared to udp because tcp includes some advanced features which might be useful .

research,suitable,hole,punching,better
i did some research and found that udp may be more suitable in this case because udp hole punching works much better than tcp hole punching

assumend,transmission,faster,tests,slower
i assumend that the transmission using udp have to be much faster than using tcp but in fact my tests proved that the udp transmission is about 7 to 8 times slower than using tcp

appropriate
btw i concur that udp is far more appropriate than tcp in this case

suggestion,hint,transmission,slower
maybe one of you guys already sees a problem in the code snippets or have any other suggestion or hint for me why my udp transmission is slower than tcp

suitable,series,sets,reliability
i ve considered that udp is more suitable for sending a series of discrete data sets but i need the reliability of tcp

overhead
certainly tcp has more overhead than udp

clients,time,worse
if your client connections are more or less permanent and not too many clients are connected at the same time tcp is only slightly worse than udp

datagram,simpler
first of udp s datagram is simpler than tcp s one

note,exceptions,firewalls,better,security,traffic,voip,speech,part,journey
note that there are exceptions to the above - for example tcp generally traverses firewalls better than udp which may be blocked due to security to traffic policy reasons so voip speech may sometimes be sent over tcp for part of its journey at least

windowing,expensive,raw,faster,custom
tcp windowing is more expensive than raw udp but if you use udp to go faster and add a custom loss-recovery or seqno ack resend manager then that may slow you down again

differences,facts,accurate,fast
i m aware of the differences in general the facts like tcp is more accurate while udp is more fast

scheme,verification,data,stringent
instead you can use udp and implement your own scheme for verification of data that is less stringent than tcp

note,architecture,slower,type,fast-paced
please note however that this architecture implements tcp which is much slower than udp and will not work for any type of fast-paced data intensive games but should accomplish your goals given your description above

easy,top,worse
also note that it is easy to implement your own stack on top of udp that performs worse than tcp

hungry
alternatively it can be used over udp which is less hungry than tcp

note,difficult,packets
note that udp is more difficult to work with than tcp because packets are not always guaranteed to be delivered

practice,better,continuous,data,lightweight,reliability,important
in practice this means that tcp is better suited for continuous transmission of data whereas the more lightweight udp can be used when reliability isn t important

decision,protocol,connection,network,secure
the decision on yours the tcp protocol used for connection oriented network that is more secure than udp

connection,security,slower,streaming
because of tcp requires connection and provides security it is slower than udp and therefore it should not be preffered during a video streaming

feature,higher,throughput
what is that key feature in tcp that makes it have much much higher throughput than udp

reliable,wide,environment,host,reliability,stuff
udp is less reliable on a wide area network but in a closed environment of a vm talking to its host you can safely skip all the tcp reliability stuff

connectionless,contrivance,relevant,connection-oriented
a heartbeat is by nature a connectionless contrivance so it goes that udp connectionless is more relevant here than tcp connection-oriented

sockets,encapsulations,slower,ofcourse,cost,info,websockets,ideal,server
i was going through internet and so and understood that web sockets are encapsulations to tcp which by itself is slower than udp ofcourse at the cost of reliability but i couldnt find much info if websockets or udp would be ideal to implement such a server

worth,mind,costly,protocol,overheads,inbuilt,connection
also if you have very limited memory processing resources it is worth bearing in mind that udp is a less costly protocol as it avoids a lot of the overheads tcp incurs due to its inbuilt connection management

safer,packets,high
i know tcp is a safer choice but let s assume i can only use udp and i need to ensure i can send packets over at a high rate with no missing packets what should i do

real-time,latency
udp lends itself to real-time less latency than tcp

ip,reliable,comparison
tcp ip is supposed to be more reliable than udp ip see this comparison

faster,extra,trip,overhead,reality,congestion,control
theoretically udp should be be 30-50 faster than tcp because it s missing the extra trip for the ack and has a smaller header overhead however in reality there are many cases where tcp would outperform udp just because of congestion control
