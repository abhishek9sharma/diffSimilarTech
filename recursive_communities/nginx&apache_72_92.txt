long, polling, client, ---------------------------------------------------

better,requests,process,request
nginx is better at handling requests since it does not spawn a new process for every request unlike apache

performant,high-levels,requests
nginx is more performant than apache in most cases with high-levels of requests

claim,performance,good,better
apache made a claim that apache 2.4 will offer performance as good or better than nginx

reverse,proxy,performance,better
i recommend you to use nginx as an reverse proxy since the configuration is easier and the performance is much better than apache

better,long,polling
4 i d like to understand why nginx might be better than apache when one is long polling and why long polling is better than periodically polling a server

model,efficient
next you ll find that the threading model of nginx is much more efficient than apache s for what you re doing

concurrent,clients,better,fork,new
the remote server is set up to allow very few maximum concurrent clients generally nginx handles many concurrent clients better than apache since it doesn t need to fork a new process for every request so if it becomes an issue you might want to look into switching web servers

requests,predefined,pattern,easier
nginx can be configured to only respond to requests matching a predefined pattern far easier than with apache

cores,better,client,requests
16 cores apache would scale better than nginx while nginx would process more client requests

look,fast,memory,client,connections
also have a look at nginx for example it is fast and uses less memory than apache to handle client connections

heavier,loads,better,look
i will say that nginx tends to handle heavier loads better than apache though so take a look at that

proper,multi-thread,architecture,better,multi-core,cpus
now back to the question my guess based on reading tests published here would be that the proper multi-thread apache architecture should scale better than nginx on multi-core cpus

setting,server,resources
also when your setting up the server i would say start with nginx it s uses less resources than apache

front,better,asynchronous,node
if you want to use something in front of it though i suggest you use something like nginx better than apache since nginx is also asynchronous like node and it s performs really well at serving static files

better,long,polling
why nginx might be better than apache when one is long polling and why long polling is better than periodically polling a server

server,efficient
nginx or other server is not much more efficient than apache

lemp,small,projects,better
i think you would like lemp e stands for the nginx and for a lot small projects it would be better than apache

server,flexible
also you should consider using nginx as server that s more flexible than apache

rewrites,complicated
i am not going into how to do rewrites on nginx because it is much more complicated than apache

better,light,single,threaded,thread,request
nginx is better suited than apache as it is light and single threaded vs apache thread per request in most normal setups

heart,better,server
i aways heart that nginx performs better than apache server

static, files, content, ---------------------------------------------------

faster,static,files,point,worth,dynamic,content
i will add that i ve often heard that nginx is faster than apache for serving static files to the point that it s sometimes worth using nginx for static files and reverse proxying to apache for dynamic content

static,file,performance,faster
for static file serving i found nginx performance lot faster than apache

static,assets,faster
very fast static assets nginx is faster than apache at serving static assets css js images ... and uses very little memory to do so

info,faster,static,pages
when i was googling info on nginx it appears to be faster than apache and works well in serving static pages

benefit,static,files,faster,ram,connections
as an added benefit nginx can also serve static files much faster than apache and nginx also uses much less ram and can handle much more connections

lower,memory,little,faster,static,files
i know nginx has lower memory footprint and little faster than apache in serving static files

static,file,performance,better
nginx s static file performance is better than apache

faster,static,pages,performance
i ve read that nginx is faster for static pages but there are questions about its performance with php compared to apache s performance with php

faster,static,content
not only is nginx supposedly faster than apache at delivering static content but this also offloads your rails application for every image stylesheet javascript or whatever other static content

consensus,static,content,faster
there seems to be a consensus that nginx serves static content faster than apache

static,files,efficient
serving static files with nginx is much more efficient than with apache

uwsgi, loaded, proxies, ---------------------------------------------------

faster
paradoxally it does not mean that apache is faster than nginx it just means that on 1 2 3 .

uwsgi,better
uwsgi is better if you are using nginx i find nginx far better than apache personally

faster
and finally from my experience nginx is faster than apache

loaded,proxies,slower
i would really like not to run both apache and nginx i did switch everything to apache yet found it loaded my proxies slower than nginx

optimizations,faster
nginx â without any optimizations done â is much faster than apache

faster,projects
i read that nginx is faster than apache and i want to try it with some of the projects and leave the others with apache

varnish,faster
you can serve it from for example nginx varnish which are usually faster than apache

faster,low,request
nginx is typically faster than apache but with a low request server it hardly matters

mod_wsgi,better
nginx with its own mod_wsgi seems to perform even better than apache but hey you didn t ask about that

faster,configuration,easier
nginx is faster than apache and the configuration is easier

better,logfiles
nginx also happens to be better than apache at writing logfiles interestingly

faster
nginx is still faster and i might choose it but apache isn t asleep

faster
nginx will definitely work faster than apache

faster
for example nginx is much faster than apache

faster
i have recently read that nginx is faster than apache

great,faster
nginx works great by itself and will likely be much faster than apache

better
how can nginx performs better than apache

easier,faster
for me apache is easier to use but i prefer nginx as it is much faster

popular,features,smaller,faster
apache is more popular and has more features nginx is smaller and faster and has less features

faster,nodejs,application
for example nginx is considered faster than apache and a nodejs application is considered faster than a php application

faster,slow,clients
nginx is faster than apache handles slow clients better and is generally easier to use

better
also what makes nginx better than apache in this case

better
i want to move to nginx since it s better than apache

web, lighter, proxy, ---------------------------------------------------

recent,innovations,lighty,web,servers,better,higher,concurrency
although this thread is more than a year old it still merits from the fact that no one mentioned about the not so recent innovations of nginx lighty and other web servers which scale much better than apache at higher concurrency and consume lesser resources

idea,someone,better,small,tasks,requests,proxy,mind
i have no idea what i m doing so i dove nose-first into nginx -- which i had never used before -- because someone told me it s better than apache at dealing with lots of small tasks and requests -- not that i would know how to turn apache into a proxy mind you

use,reverse,proxy,front,node.js,better,solution
i ve heard it suggested that i use nginx as a reverse proxy in front of apache and node.js is that a better solution than just nginx

tornadoweb,popular,web,better,performance,certain,circumstances
tornadoweb and nginx are popular web servers for the moment and many benchmarkings show that they have a better performance than apache under certain circumstances

php-fpm,server,operations,faster,mod-php,efficient
is nginx + php-fpm is suppose to do server operations much faster than apache + mod-php due to efficient usage of memory and other resources

proxy,layer,better,performance,nodejs,server
note that in any case for increased security and fast static file css js delivery you might want to add a reverse proxy layer nginx usually provides better performance but apache works as well before the nodejs python server

tomcat,web,server,past,slowness,lighter,faster
i have configured tomcat with apache web server in past and never slowness problem before and practically speaking nginx is said to much lighter and faster than apache web server

faster,lighter,easier,.htaccess,support,analog,performance
nginx is faster and lighter but many people find it easier to work with apache because of .htaccess support nginx does not have an analog due to performance concern

other---------------------------------------------------

haproxy,experience
i also know there is nginx and haproxy although i have never used either of them and have a lot more experience with apache

phpbrew,simpler,simple,humble
i ve been attempting to upgrade to php 7.1 using phpbrew and elected to install it with nginx as i read everywhere that it was simpler than apache not that simple in my humble opinion

event,non,usage,lower
nginx uses an event based non blocking single thread and the memory usage is relatively much lower than apache

friendly,configuration,htpasswd,rules,regard,static
apache is more friendly configuration wise htaccess htpasswd rewrite rules etc nginx is fast in regard to static assets

gunicorn,likely,better,modwsgi,point
nginx + gunicorn is likely to work better than apache + modwsgi at this point in time

syntax,configuration,different,clean
the syntax for nginx configuration is different but more clean than apache

memory
also nginx uses a lot less memory than apache

traffic,sites,slower,varnish,front
we have a few clients who have very high traffic sites running apache slower than nginx with varnish in front of it and they get way more traffic than you are saying with little to no performance problems

expert,deployment,faster,friendly
i am not an expert in deployment but in my experience nginx is much faster and more friendly to django compared to apache

servers,lighthttp,large,amounts,traffic,memory,power,flexibility
servers like lighthttp and nginx can handle large amounts of traffic in much less memory than apache if you can sacrifice apache s power and flexibility or if you just don t need those things which often you don t

picky,file,names
nginx is more picky about case of file names than apache

proxy,systems,popular,easier,configuration,https
any one of the reverse proxy systems can likely do this nginx is popular too and generally has easier configuration than apache but i ve never used it with https

design,thread,client,reactor,pattern,meaning,traffic,web,server
apache s design is thread per client while nginx uses the reactor pattern meaning - nginx can handle much more traffic than apache as a web server about 50 times the number of requests

flexable,high,price
apache is more flexable then nginx but it comes with a high price in performance

memory,size,setup
nginx uses less memory than apache given the size of your setup i would definitely recommend that

experience,complex,worker,efficient
however my experience is that configuring it in apache is significantly more complex than configuring it in nginx and even with worker it still is not quite as efficient with nginx

busy
it seems your apache is more busy than your nginx

lighter
nginx is very fast much lighter than apache

everyone,great,faster,setup,multiple
hi everyone i need help with this i ve already set up nginx + php and it works great faster than apache my problem is how to setup a multiple projects in one ip

mod_php,stable,cleaner,http,bad
apache mod_php is much more stable and cleaner while nginx will often deliver http bad gateway error coded in 502

switchover,little,rule,default,upstream,version,centos,rules,straight
the switchover to nginx really had little to do with the rewrite rule and more to do with getting away from apache 2.2 default upstream version for centos however with nginx rewrite rules are more straight forward than apache s imo

new,faster,resource-hungry,hard,thing
i m new to nginx and want to try it out since it apparently is much faster and less resource-hungry than apache but i can t see why this would be such a hard thing to achieve

kind,things,painfull,easier
but doing that kind of things with apache is rather painfull and is easier with nginx

ups,worse,job
i m about to try apache but most write ups suggest that this is worse than nginx at this job

easier,opinion
nginx is actually quite a lot easier than apache in my opinion

id,love,better,issue,fuelphp
id love to know how to solve this since using nginx sometimes is a better option than apache and having this issue with fuelphp framework and not being able to use this two great tools together is awful

configuration,flexible,front,end
also nginx s configuration is much more flexible than apache and by having it on the front end it gives you a lot of flexibility

quicker,struggle,specific,need
nginx is quicker though honestly you ll struggle to see the difference except for very high volume sites and has quickly become the web server of choice for a lot of people if you don t have any specific need for apache for your code

select,epoll,--with-select_module,efficient
in fact nginx can use select instead of epoll if you compile it with the --with-select_module option and i bet it will still be more efficient than apache
