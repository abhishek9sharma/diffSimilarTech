div, left, right, ---------------------------------------------------

div,left,greater,image
the title goes in a h1 for example and the text in a p or div so set these two elements to have a left margin greater than the width of image a

right,column,equal,greater,fixed-width
a common solution is to float your fixed-width column left or right and give the other column a margin equal or greater than the width of the fixed-width column

consideration,side,large,container
you have to take into consideration that borders take up width and that the margin of 1 of either side of the large container means that it can only be less than 100 width

row,+15px,right,bigger,window
the reason why your website is x-scrollable on all devices is that you forgot to add to and the row inside it has 100 +15px left margin +15px right margin which is bigger than window width

div,higher,maximum,main,container
now if the div with has margin 660px from the left it should be hidden because it s margin is higher than the maximum width of the main container

left,right,larger
by giving the middle indicators div a left and right margin slightly larger than the width of the left and right button divs you allow it to float up between the two and take up as much space as possible

huge,distance,bigger,screen,stackoverflow
when i launch it with firefox or internet explorer the box gets immediately to a huge distance from the margin much bigger than the width of the screen and now i noticed that if i run it with stackoverflow s snippet function the box does not move

negative,equal,greater,element,effect
once the negative margin is equal or greater than the width of that element further negative margin has no effect

screen,left,view,right
but if the screen width is less than 200 then it will be from left view edge margin to right view edge margin.

content,div,larger,sidebar
the the main content div needs to have left margin larger than the width of your sidebar

value,little,bigger,image,specific
anyway i just set the margin to a value a little bigger than the width of the image and overlap is eliminated only in the very specific case we want

content,table,left,right,auto
if the content leads to a width that is less than 100 of the table s containing block then setting the left right margin to auto will center the table within the containing block

div,article,little,bigger,usual
aside of the left floated div i have another div article with a margin a little bigger than the width of the floating div just usual for a two column layout

auto,better,container,centre
first one margin auto is better if you can know width of container list and you don t want centre content of this container

box,small,adjacent,div,bigger,ul
the box is never too small infact the margin of the adjacent div is bigger than the width of ul div

div,right,greater,right-floated,element
give the sample text div a right margin greater than the width of the right-floated element

negative,viewport,iphone,view
you re negative margin is more than half the viewport width of an iphone therefore it is dragging it out of view

large,left,wider,column
another option is not to float the main content column but instead assuming it s the right column to give it a large left margin that is slightly wider than the width of the left column

divs,style,greater,equal,image,50px
you can try giving an id to each one of the divs or style them for margin that is greater than or equal to the image width.assuming you image width is 50px this code shall work

side,div,width.one,auto
how to place 2 div side by side one div is of 75 width and the other is 25 width.one more div with margin 0 auto

inner,div,lesser,sidebar,class
one way of doing this is checking if left margin of the inner div is lesser than the width of sidebar and then only add class adjust

left,div2,greater,div1
i just made the left margin of div2 greater than the width of div1 and it worked for me

bigger, work, real, ---------------------------------------------------

work,bigger,real,auto,content
but in general this wouldn t work because of the specified width is bigger than the real one and exceed it so there s no margin to auto it and center the content which found in div

point,text,bigger,figure
what i do not understand is why the size of the point and the text is not the same and why the margin can be bigger than the width of the figure

greater, drawer, open, ---------------------------------------------------

drawer,open,greater
on release the drawer should slide open if its margin is greater than half its width and should close if its less

additional,element,greater
you have given width of 50 with additional margin of 5 to each of the element which is greater than 100 width

total,greater,separate
adding margin adds more width making the total width of the two elements and their margin greater than 100 pushing the elements onto separate lines

next, border, padding, ---------------------------------------------------

next,padding,total
and if they aren t next to eachother that means your padding and margin is more than the 5 width of total width so reduce them

total,object,padding,border,columns,container
just so you know you want the total width object width + padding + margin + border of both columns to be less than the width of the container

float,next,combined,border,padding,blocks,equal,container
this means they won t float next to one another unless you set the width of each so that the combined width + margin + border + padding of both blocks is equal to or less than the width of the container

padding, notice, arrow, ---------------------------------------------------

notice,arrow,px,carousal,padding
i notice that when the arrow block is rendered when width is less than 296 px inside the carousal there is some space between the left border of the carousal and the arrow block even though i did not add padding or margin

css,height,directives,images,nicer,padding
edit someone else suggested css and i believe that using the height and width directives from css will give you the same result as using the same attributes of the tag but doesn t limit you strictly to images and a will play nicer with any margin or padding directives you might use

other---------------------------------------------------

textblock,columns,clipping,earlier
so it would also be possible to have all three textblock columns starsized but that means width clipping does occur earlier and there is more margin

window,total,open,windows,greater,first,chat
i m using the function window .resize to detect if the total width of all open windows plus some margin is greater than the window s width then hide the first chat window or show the last one if there s space for more windows

browser,110px
if browser width is more than 768px then set a 110px margin

viewport,body,default
the elements are sized relative to the entire viewport but the body width is less than this because of the default margin on body

images,image
50 width is more than enough for the images to fit even with the image margin

screen,larger,contents,media,query
when the screen width becomes larger than 500px the contents of the media query are ignored and the margin becomes 20

20px,x
instead of the reaching 100 width the margin is causing less width for them due to the 20px x 12

animation,longer
my guess is that they are technically happening simultaneously but that the margin animation takes longer to complete than the width animation

percent,work,browsers,flex,related,viewport,css,calc,equal
margin using percent doesn t work cross browsers on flex items so if your margin s is more related to the viewport use viewport units vh or vw else you can combine px with css calc width calc 33.333 - 20px to match an equal gutter between the items

column,pixels,size,greater,content,area,siblings
the first-child column has 10 pixels or whatever the margin size is greater content area width than it s siblings

difficult,outside,box
but the margin is more difficult to include in the width because it is on the outside of the box

window,re-sized,810px,css,styling,top,infinity
essentially my logic is when the window is re-sized and the width is less than 810px then remove all css styling and add margin top items 2 through infinity
