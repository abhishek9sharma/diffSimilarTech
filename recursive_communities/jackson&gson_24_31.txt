large, objects, simple, ---------------------------------------------------

general,consensus,faster
i ve seen questions like this come up before and the general consensus is that jackson is much faster than gson

faster,smaller,documents,large
gson is faster with smaller documents and jackson is faster with large documents

large,objects,faster,simple,json
large objects google gson performs faster than jackson and simple json

object,google,faster,simple,json
very small object google gson performs faster than jackson and simple json

low-level,streaming,parser,faster
gson 1.6 now includes a low-level streaming api and a new parser which is actually faster than jackson

google,better,json,parsing
also i want to know if google gson is better than jackson for json parsing

faster,api,complex
jackson is faster but the api is 37x more complex than the gson api

conditions,faster,jsonp,json.simple
under some conditions gson has proven to be a lot faster than jackson there also exists jsonp and json.simple

suitable,complex,json,tree,temporary,objects
jackson is more suitable if you have a complex deep json tree because gson creates a lot of temporary objects which leads to stop the world gcs

little,faster,default,serialization
in my case i found jackson little faster than gson i used default serialization because so far i don t have a need to customize serialization

look,json,parser,android,faster,streaming
take a look at the jackson json parser it s faster than the one in android and faster than gson and supports streaming

slower, metrics, gson.tojson, ---------------------------------------------------

metrics,slower
i looked at gson metrics and it seems slower than jackson

faster,json
further more gson really seems to be faster than jackson json

gson.tojson,myobject,slower
according to the performance results at for serialization with databind with strings gson.tojson myobject gson is over 10x slower than jackson

benchmarks,faster
personally i prefer jackson as according to test benchmarks it s faster than gson

correct,worst,slower
code looks correct and even at its worst jackson should be no slower than gson

simpler,faster
gson is simpler jackson is faster

performance, project, lib, ---------------------------------------------------

lib,better,performance,packages
also it seems jackson lib has better performance than other packages such as gson which i haven t tried personally

performance,better
performance of jackson is better than gson

better,performance,project
i found jackson better than gson performance project activity better docs ...

application,safer,better
we plan to use gson extensively in the application as it seems safer and better than jackson

type,safety,better
jackson type safety is way better than gson

google,better,performance,plan,project,diffrent
after searched in google found that jackson has better performance than gson i plan to replace gson with jackson in my project but i got a diffrent result when run test code

other---------------------------------------------------

fast,binary,serializers,2-4x,faster,situations,10-20x
gson is not particularly fast but the jackson library can almost compete with most binary serializers jackson is 2-4x faster than gson in most situations and 10-20x faster on utf-8 because it has special code for utf-8

performance,similar,9x,slower,fastjson,faster
deserialization performance is similar with gson over 9x slower than jackson and fastjson about 0.5 faster than jackson

larger,65k,methods
keep in mind though that jackson is a larger library than gson so depending on your case you might prefer gson to avoid 65k methods limitation

faster,average,time,2ms,16ms,mistake
it seems gson is more faster than jackson the average time of gson is about 2ms while jackson is about 16ms does i make mistake when using jackson

lib,good,server,side,slow,android,test
try this lib that s a good one with the jackson we use only in the server side because jackson is more slow in the android than gson at least in our test

note,features,box,genson
note also that gson comes with less features out of the box than genson or jackson

familiar,aspects,complete,support,apologies,feature
since i am more familiar with jackson here are some aspects where i think jackson has more complete support than gson apologies if i miss a gson feature

user,friendly,powerful
going to go ahead and say that gson is a lot more user friendly albeit less powerful than jackson
