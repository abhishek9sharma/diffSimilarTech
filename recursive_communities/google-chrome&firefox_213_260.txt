better, time, browser, ---------------------------------------------------

logs,browser,laugh,better,google,apps
the logs only seem to work with a google-chrome browser which is a laugh as usually firefox is better at running google apps than google-chrome

pd,note,developer,tools,better,complete
pd note that firefox s developer tools are better and more complete than google-chrome developer tools but in essence are for the same purpose

better,benchmark
also why does firefox perform way better than google-chrome on this benchmark

better
firefox handles this better than google-chrome does but neither exactly the way i want

debugger
what s up with google-chrome that the debugger behaves less conveniently than firefox

performance
the performance in google-chrome is best less so in firefox and ie

time,add-on,api,restrictive
no and there won t be any time soon because google-chrome s add-on api is more restrictive than firefox

worse,load,time
my guess is google-chrome is caching more agressively and thats why you are seeing worse load time on firefox

little,nicer,element
in firefox this might be handled a little nicer than google-chrome but rather than completely redraw an element you should try to append only what you need

better,performance
in my experience google-chrome has better javascript performance than firefox

nexus,better,display,sluggish
firefox on nexus 7 is a bit better at producing reasonable sample rate readings but the updating of the display is even more sluggish than google-chrome

better,black
in firefox it s much better than google-chrome but still not as black as ie

better
also it does appear that firefox consistently handles this better than ie or google-chrome

better,use,slower,image,comparison
better use google-chrome even thought firefox is not slower than google-chrome for once probably the tracing for the image comparison pays off yay

easier,better,element,webpage
firefox is easier and better than google-chrome in finding the element from the webpage

formatting,better
it seems google-chrome applies some formatting to render better than firefox

better,browser,developers,cause,tools
although firefox is a better browser for developers than google-chrome cause it gives you more tools to work with

ps,situation,better,new,line
ps i ve noticed that in google-chrome situation is better than in firefox but new line still starts beneath tag

bigger,time,difference,gap,animation
google-chrome has a bigger time difference yet firefox is the one with the gap in the animation

alternative,ajax,add-on,easier,web,browser
another alternative for javascript ajax is writing a google-chrome add-on easier than firefox or embeding a web browser within your application

transparency,issue,better
transparency is also an issue however google-chrome seems to handle all three better than firefox

better
my firefox adds more chopping to video playing itself google-chrome plays the video much better

html,collection,better,imo
google-chrome sends back and html collection that is longer really better imo than firefox ie or chromium

animations,chromium,better,general,browsing
also for animations google-chrome chromium behaves much better that is why i use it for development but do my general browsing in firefox

better
google-chrome handles these better than compared to firefox

better,crash,issue
i have tried firefox and it better than google-chrome crash issue is not always happen but not solved this issue

debugger,firebug,better
evidently firefox debugger firebug is better than google-chrome debugger

sporadic,time,lesser,extent
this is sporadic and i see it happening most of the time with firefox 4.0.1 and 5.0 and to a lesser extent with google-chrome

apis,experimental,likely,better
the google-chrome apis are currently experimental hence these tools are likely to be better developed under firefox

better
also ie and firefox seems to work better than google-chrome

computer,better,tests,jsperf
on my computer firefox performs much better than google-chrome on these tests using jsperf

test,timer,better,hope
when i ran the test individually with a timer google-chrome actually performed better than firefox hope this helps

better,regard
so firefox is better than google-chrome - but both suck in that regard

iframes,better,span,font
they use iframes in firefox which seems better but in google-chrome they do this by putting manually defined span and font tags

time,plugin,better
it s not the first time that the plugin for firefox works better for me than the one for google-chrome

better,firebug
google-chrome shows it better than firefox firebug

device,dependent,objects,better,arrays
performance is browser and device dependent for example firefox handles objects better than arrays while google-chrome prefers arrays

new,tiles,maps.google.com,issue,better
in firefox the render of new tiles and the panning is laggy this is not the case when using maps.google.com so it s not an issue of google-chrome being better than firefox

knowledge,better,apologies
my knowledge of firefox is better than google-chrome so my apologies if i missed something

dev,tools,better
google-chrome dev tools are by far better than firefox ie whatever imho

late,better,performance
of late firefox has had much better performance than google-chrome

better,support
is it because google-chrome has much better javascript support than firefox

ie8,better,browser,possible
ie8 is the same and firefox is much better but i ve migrated away to google-chrome now so would like to stick with the one browser if possible

computer,statistics,better,normal-fast,best,slow
bad buffering can also be a result of a slow computer because statistics show that google-chrome is better for a normal-fast computer and firefox works best on slow computers

browser,usage,android,line,pasting,better
if you are able to enforce browser usage i find that google-chrome on android preserves line breaks when copying and pasting much better than firefox

better,settimeout,final
firefox works a bit better than google-chrome but the settimeout just seems to delay the final result being shown rather than delaying each step

test,combos,quicker
the most interesting thing i noted is that certain test combos in firefox are much quicker than even google-chrome

algorithm,better,text
and additionally the algorithm that google-chrome uses is better than the one in firefox at least for handling the resizing of text

firebug,version,better
install firebug firefox version is better then a google-chrome one

better,accuracy,lower,time
phantomjs achieves a better accuracy than firefox slightly lower than google-chrome but in around half the time of firefox

faster, slower, browser, ---------------------------------------------------

typeof,slower,fastest
in google-chrome typeof is slower than the other two but in firefox it is the fastest

color,btw.,faster
now when clicking a time less than 1 millisecond will be displayed however it obviously takes nearly a second on my computer until the changed color actually is displayed where btw. google-chrome seems to be faster than firefox

svg,performance,slower,webkit,ie10
svg performance in firefox is slower than in webkit google-chrome and ie10

performance,test,filling,faster,clearing
here is a simple performance test showing that in google-chrome filling is faster than clearing i am not sure what goes on with google-chrome and canvas nowadays but in firefox clearing is many times faster than filling both significantly faster than google-chrome

use,dev,mode,slower
use firefox rather than google-chrome - google-chrome with dev mode is much slower than firefox

idea,frame,browser,correct
the idea is that if they are using ie then they must install google-chrome frame and if they are using less than firefox 4 or opera 11.5 then they must upgrade their browser not not sure if the way i am doing that is correct

developer,mode,details
i usually use google-chrome s developer mode which imho already gives even more details than firefox

slower,laptop
why is firefox so much slower than google-chrome on my laptop

faster,wait,expected
maybe google-chrome is working faster than firefox try adding a wait with expected conditions

faster,webdriver,dom
as you said google-chrome is faster than firefox so the webdriver is trying to interact with the dom before when elements are not yet visible exist

slower
firefox is even slower that google-chrome

use,development,faster,icons
i use google-chrome for development as i find it runs faster than firefox and ie so it is a bore to guess where the icons are

faster,sunspider,tests,loads,correct
right now google-chrome is faster than firefox sunspider tests so your statement it loads faster in firefox is not really correct

faster,drawimage
rendering without buffering on google-chrome is faster than firefox so i m actually not sure why google-chrome is having such a problem with drawimage

browser,behavior,stricter
it is also proper browser behavior firefox is just stricter about it than google-chrome is

function,older,version
i would like this function to work in firefox ie google-chrome etc but at the moment it only works in google-chrome and older than firefox version 49

browser,slower
it depends on the browser its definitely true for ie and firefox but seems slower on google-chrome

thats,mean,faster,execution
however if thats the case does this mean firefox is faster in execution than google-chrome

idea,loads,function,slower
do you have any idea why google-chrome loads javascript function much slower than firefox

slower
firefox is slower than google-chrome in javascript

.prototype,faster,difference,slower
in google-chrome it seems .prototype is faster firefox shows no difference between the two although generally performs slower than google-chrome

faster,huge,files
in my experience google-chrome will be a lot faster than firefox to debug huge js files

results,browser,faster,webkit
the results varied from a browser to another firefox 4.0b12 is faster using but google-chrome webkit and opera is faster when using

renatoargh,test,faster
for example using renatoargh s test google-chrome is faster with option 2 firefox with option 1

dom,api,1000-fold,slower,worse,areas,instance,test,innerhtml,faster
google-chrome is lightning fast when you use the dom api but vastly slower using the .innerhtml operator by a magnitude 1000-fold slower however firefox is worse than google-chrome in some areas for instance the append test is much slower than google-chrome but the innerhtml test runs much faster than google-chrome

particular,page,faster
the trouble is choosing a good value for x since for this particular page google-chrome is so very much faster than firefox which is faster than ie

faster,imacros
i ve found that firefox is greatly faster with imacros than google-chrome

faster
that means firefox is more than 7x faster than google-chrome here

slower,sunspider,tests
as you can see ie 8 is about 5 times slower than firefox 3.6 and almost 20 times slower than google-chrome 9 at least when using sunspider tests

tldr,filter,faster,opposite
tldr in firefox filter is slightly faster in google-chrome that s the opposite

gsap,performance,worse,repeats,css,animations
firefox gsap performance is still much worse than in google-chrome but google-chrome gsap does still lag every few repeats or so while in google-chrome the css animations do not

browser,wrapping,worse,extra,space
though from a design perspective it may be easier to simply add the extra 5px to the width designing for the worst case browser to prevent wrapping in google-chrome which is worse than extra space in firefox ie

ie8,faster
in ie8 and google-chrome it runs even faster than firefox in general and this slow down never happens

version,faster
but i guess google-chrome i have version 10 should be much faster than firefox 3.6

mac,os,game,faster,smoother
i m on a mac os x 10.8.2 running firefox 18.0.2 - it actually runs the game faster and smoother than my google-chrome 25.0.1364.99

abc_def,property,faster
the funny thing is that for abc_def property google-chrome is actually much faster than firefox and ie as i expected

condition,version
i need to do the same condition but for less than google-chrome version 46 and for less than firefox version 44

anyone,slower,3d,rendering
and also does anyone know why is firefox so much slower than google-chrome in 3d rendering

load,faster
based on what you have provided i cannot tell if google-chrome actually does load faster than firefox

slower,usable
i ve tested the sample on firefox and it s a bit slower than google-chrome but usable

slow,path,array.filter,slower,run
google-chrome is extremely slow for your code path but grep seems to be 50 faster than array.filter here making it 900 slower than the firefox run

faster,bool
on google-chrome it s significantly faster to do this using 1 0 but on firefox it s slightly faster to do this using bool

faster,70x
this makes firefox 50x faster than google-chrome and 70x faster than safari is there any known reason for that

v8,faster,spidermonkey,things
as google-chrome s v8 is dramatically faster than firefox s spidermonkey at the moment these things are constantly in flux pick the forward loop as it s faster on the slower engine

function,slower,machine
also google-chrome s map function is up to 2x slower than firefox on my machine

spidermonkey,slower,max,speed
spidermonkey firefox is slower 50 of google-chrome max speed but the speed is consistent

results,reproducible,faster,timeouts,dom
and of course the results - if they are reproducible - might suggest that google-chrome is faster than firefox or that firefox just prioritises timeouts over dom events

slower,boats,highest
firefox is slower than google-chrome which boats one of the highest javascript engines a modified version of webkit

parsers,performance,v37,slower,v30
i have been working with linear parsers lately and noticed the performance in google-chrome v37 was much slower than in firefox v30

browser,default,longer
i want to set my own time limit rather than use the browser s default i believe google-chrome s is much longer than firefox s

slower,devmode,plugin
the reason google-chrome is slower than firefox is that the devmode plugin runs in a sandbox so calls and data have to cross the sandbox boundaries

faster,browser,spread,results,accurate,result
i am not concerned about the fact that firefox runs faster as browser js implementations will vary so much as the wide spread of results encountered in google-chrome that makes getting an accurate result impossible

slowdown,worker,thread,slower,main
update just tried it on firefox 30 and it did not experience the same slowdown in a worker thread but it was slower than google-chrome when run in the main thread

browser,implementation,faster,brackets,dots
it s just a matter of preferences and browser implementation eg firefox works faster with brackets while google-chrome works faster with the dots

hardware,faster
also firefox 4 has hardware accelerated canvas that is marginally faster than ie9 and a lot faster than google-chrome

good,slower
firefox - good a bit slower than google-chrome

system,development,mode,slower,details
because of how google-chrome s plugin system works development mode in google-chrome is much slower than in firefox or safari see here for more details

faster,bit-wise
google-chrome is just faster than firefox which just faster than ie at bit-wise operations

slower,respectful,privacy
using firefox even it s slower than google-chrome it s still more respectful of privacy

easier, webextensions, instead, ---------------------------------------------------

webextensions,easier,instead.
i have been trying to do this in firefox webextensions but if it s easier with google-chrome i will try it that way instead.

easy,apk,command,easier
with firefox it was very easy i just grabbed the apk from their ftp server run the adb install command one would think it should be even easier with google-chrome but it s really not

easier,days
firefox is probably easier than google-chrome these days

data, stricter, base, ---------------------------------------------------

correct,stricter,base,uri
i d say that firefox is correct in being stricter than google-chrome here even though i m not entirely sure the base uri has changed and this new uri should be used for the relative uri #symboltype1 too

data,seconds
using the same data google-chrome does in less than 5 seconds what took ie and firefox 10 to 15 seconds to accomplish

stricter,data,local
google-chrome is stricter than firefox when it comes to loading data from your local filesystem

strict, lax, restriction, ---------------------------------------------------

lax,security,restriction,strict,mixed-content
it works in firefox because firefox is more lax about this security restriction and google-chrome happens to be more strict on mixed-content errors

restrictions,files,strict,middle
apple s safari applies almost no cross domain restrictions to files opened locally but firefox is much more strict about what it permits with google-chrome somewhere in the middle

strict,things,commas
google-chrome s parsing may be more strict than firefox is at having things like trailing commas as specified by the standard at as stated in danilo celic s answer

higher, smaller, larger, ---------------------------------------------------

permission,error,reproducible
this does not seem to occur in safari or ie and a similar permission error occurs sometimes in firefox but is reproducible more often than not in google-chrome

server,google,error
when i run my http web server on google google-chrome it gives more 324 error than in firefox

default,textbox,padding
firefox s default textbox includes more padding than ie google-chrome

ideas,spacing
any ideas why google-chrome is apply more spacing than firefox ie

work,setting,iframed,page,larger,part,text
safari and opera work with the google-chrome setting but firefox and ie display the iframed page larger than google-chrome causing part of the text to be cut off

great,tool,useful,quicker,extensions
also google-chrome has a great tool that allows you to edit css on the fly which i find more useful and quicker than using firefox s extensions

issue,webdriver,higher,security,counterpart
found that the issue stemmed from using the firefox webdriver which apparently has much higher security than its google-chrome counterpart

extensions,power,wider,access
firefox extensions have much more power than google-chrome and have wider access to browser s internal api

footer,link,text,larger,margins,icons
this is because in ie and firefox the footer link text is larger than in google-chrome and safari therefore the margins that i ve set up for the icons do not work

thumbnail,smaller
firefox thumbnail 4 times smaller than on google-chrome

pixels,size,bigger
that happens because pixels size in google-chrome is bigger than in firefox

text,smaller,right
why in firefox text smaller left than in google-chrome and opera right

passwords,smaller
google-chrome renders passwords smaller than firefox

button,tad,smaller
in google-chrome the button should be a tad smaller than in firefox

fonts,issue,font,higher,size
i know different engines render fonts differently and but the issue i m having is that firefox renders the font higher than google-chrome - at the size i am displaying the font this is very noticeable 3 or 4 px - which on a button means they re totally misaligned

memory,errors,heights,greater,higher
i ve ran into out of memory errors on firefox with canvas heights greater than 8000 google-chrome seems to handle much higher at least to 32000

extensions,limited,hook
google-chrome extensions are considerably more limited than firefox extensions â â they can only hook the behavior of the browser in certain predefined ways

header,request,bigger
here the working header request with firefox bigger than google-chrome request

suffice,start,problems,larger,heights
suffice to say ie and google-chrome start having problems at larger heights than does firefox

top,cells,look,taller
currently with the 10px top padding the cells in google-chrome look taller than in firefox

font,smaller,ie
in google-chrome the font appears to be 1px smaller than firefox and ie and i cannot see why

tools,browsers,#main_nav_bar,ul,wider
after looking into the issue with the inspection tools of both browsers it seems that firefox is making the #main_nav_bar ul 10px wider than google-chrome

line-through,style,lower,implementation,different
it seems that in firefox ie the line-through style is a bit lower than google-chrome i am not sure if this is because of the implementation of different browsers or something

text,bigger,bolder
i have too problem with text in the firefox is bigger maybe bolder as in google-chrome .

button,wider
in google-chrome the button is wider than in firefox

higher,original
in google-chrome it is appearing higher than the original in firefox

font-size,smaller
if we remove the font-size it appears properly in google-chrome but shows up smaller in firefox

height,bigger,input
why height in google-chrome is bigger than firefox of input

position,higher,matter,padding
the position of the list in firefox is always higher than that of google-chrome no matter how i padding or margin the list

width,columns,problems
firefox has like 40px less width than google-chrome in columns which is causing problems

spacing,letter,larger
i am checking it in firefox and google-chrome and see that in google-chrome spacing between letter is larger than in firefox

green,image,smaller,bigger,necessary,images,unchanged
if i remove this code the width of green image in firefox becomes smaller but it s still bigger than necessary about 100px the google-chrome images keeps unchanged

inches,higher,displays
what firefox displays is about 5 inches higher than what google-chrome displays

right,developers
thus i think firefox is perhaps more right but other developers at google-chrome think otherwise

select,box,taller,element,container,blue
the reason this is happening is because firefox renders the select box as a taller element than google-chrome and the container of the blue text is getting caught on the select s container element because it s now sticking out lower than the others

heads,firebug+firepath,handy,tool,developer
first just a heads up you may want to try firebug+firepath on firefox which is a more handy tool than google-chrome s developer tool

fonts,thinner
even then google-chrome s fonts look thinner than in firefox or ie

default,font,larger
arabic default font in google-chrome is larger than it is in firefox

text,size,larger,15px
for example if you have a text size of 15px well firefox makes a larger 15px than google-chrome does

tooltip,delay,higher
for my website i noticed that tooltip delay in firefox was much higher than in google-chrome

fiddle,positioning,background,image,lower
open up the fiddle in both firefox google-chrome to see what i m talking about - in firefox the positioning of the background image is much lower than in google-chrome safari

benchmark,extensions,higher,performance
so i wonder the benchmark is also influenced by the installed extensions or google-chrome is really so much higher than firefox in performance

width,document,smaller,example,screen,resolution,reports
while the rest of the browsers report the correct width of the document firefox reports a smaller one example at screen resolution of 1920x1080 ie google-chrome and safari reports 1920 while firefox reports 1903

left-collumn,bigger,height
but in firefox the left-collumn gets a much bigger height than in google-chrome

longer,input,fields
google-chrome renders longer input fields than firefox and ie

lower
in firefox it seems that this is 1px lower than in google-chrome and safari

higher
i just found out that if you re using google-chrome you trigger antialiasing at 49px or higher however with firefox it s set at 257px or higher

green,div,bigger,different
in google-chrome the green div is bigger than in firefox i really don t know what is the problem i think in firefox it displays as it should but in google-chrome and ie9 it displays different

inputs,attribute,wider
even if you give the inputs a attribute firefox renders them wider than google-chrome

pc,fine,server,smaller
my question is similar the same page in my pc renders fine firefox google-chrome but the same one on a server rendered smaller by firefox google-chrome ok

browsers,background,whiter,brighter
in firefox and other browsers the background is much whiter and brighter than in google-chrome

menu,links,px,smaller
my menu links seem in google-chrome correctly but in firefox my menu links are 1 px smaller than google-chrome

word,look,wider
the same word in firefox look wider than in google-chrome

programming,extensions,easier,similar
i found programming google-chrome extensions easier than firefox but i couldn t come across something similar to xpcom in google-chrome

smaller,screenshot,break-point
it looks like google-chrome is smaller in your screenshot there so firefox could just not be at the defined break-point yet

font-size,larger
i ve found that the font-size in firefox is a bit larger than in google-chrome

issue,height
the issue that i encountered was that google-chrome was giving me height about 300px more than the firefox ie

text,lower
firefox text is 1px lower than in google-chrome and ie

site,display,font-size,1px,bigger
i built a site and the problem is google-chrome display font-size 1px bigger than firefox

browsers,instance,white
notably this doesn t happen in all browsers google-chrome renders more smoothly than ie and firefox for instance but is there any way i can make those white lines stop appearing when the user zooms in

font-face,bold,bolder
font-face bold in firefox is bolder than in google-chrome

input,button,padding
in firefox the input button has more padding than in google-chrome

shape,button,2px,taller,right
by highlighting the shape of the two elements you can see that in firefox left the button is 2px taller than in google-chrome right

higher,baseline
ie firefox higher than baseline google-chrome on baseline

linux,text,pixel,higher
on linux google-chrome displays text about one pixel higher than firefox and opera

forgiving, work, extension, ---------------------------------------------------

lenient
in my experience firefox is sometimes more lenient than google-chrome but i would definitely test in both

resources,threads,possible,work
also about firefox i know still less than google-chrome and i m not sure about how it innerly manage resources among threads and if it is even possible to achieve what i want but if possible i d need to do the same work with firefox threads

finnicky
in general i have found google-chrome to be more finnicky than firefox

work,forgiving,errors
actually your code doesn t work on firefox because he is less forgiving than google-chrome about errors

advanced,plugin,extension,work
firefox has a more advanced plugin than the google-chrome extension but both work

error,multiple,jquerys,older,newer,version
i believe the error might be how firefox and google-chrome handles these multiple times included jquerys and it might be that google-chrome uses the older and firefox newer version

forgiving,irregular,syntax
i m taking a quite educated guess here that firefox is more forgiving with the irregular syntax than google-chrome

standards-compliant
firefox which is more standards-compliant than google-chrome doesn t allow this

detailed,information,ajax,errors
google-chrome provides more detailed information about the ajax errors even when firefox doesn t say anything

forgiving,mistakes
google-chrome is just more forgiving for some mistakes then firefox

extension,reliable,addict
2 install the firefox extension there s also one for google-chrome but the firefox one is more reliable -- so if you re a google-chrome addict like i am then use both

forgiving
i guess google-chrome is a bit more forgiving than firefox

html,page,forgiving
most likely your post value has one or more characters in it that are breaking the html of the page and ie firefox are being a bit more forgiving than google-chrome is

simple,extension,business,longer
this is due to the simple fact that firefox has been in the extension business longer than google-chrome or ie

forgiving,compliant
google-chrome is more forgiving or you could call it less compliant firefox less so

stable,versions,permissions,older,work
on stable versions of google-chrome the permissions show allow and it still won t connect even with firefox works older versions of google-chrome work

characters, illegal, picky, ---------------------------------------------------

lenient,illegal,characters,url
maybe google-chrome is more lenient when it comes to illegal characters in the url than firefox or something like that

picky,characters,uris
firefox is more picky about characters that are set in uris than google-chrome

ram, memory, ---------------------------------------------------

memory
firefox allocates lots of memory during that preloading up to 20-30 times more than google-chrome or safari do and even twice as much as ie

ram
we use google-chrome though which i believe uses more ram than firefox

slower, duration, 1s, ---------------------------------------------------

element,quicker,duration,1s,animation,2s,slower
firefox seems to animate the element quicker than google-chrome does and so while a duration of 1s is enough for the animation in google-chrome firefox needs it to be 2s to be slower and show the effect

trickier,bug,situation,slower,amount,buffer
this is trickier to work around and you should file a google-chrome bug describing the situation and where it s slower than firefox but you could potentially reduce the amount of buffer uploads by looking into instancing or using uniform arrays instead of updating vertexes for positions textures

strict, ---------------------------------------------------

strict
is this due to firefox being more strict than google-chrome

strict
google-chrome is a bit more strict than firefox here

similar, issue, scrolling, ---------------------------------------------------

similar,older,issue,url,scrolling,execution
i have encounter a problem with google-chrome that is similar to an older issue with firefox at this url scrolling blocks javascript execution in firefox

issue,windows,framerate,lower,mac,similar,framerates
i m seeing a strange issue on windows in google-chrome the framerate is almost 2 times lower than in firefox on mac google-chrome and firefox have similar framerates

more-so, pickier, ---------------------------------------------------

more-so
it looks like it shows for firefox more-so than google-chrome but it might help

pickier
apparently google-chrome is pickier than firefox

console, first, information, ---------------------------------------------------

console,information
the google-chrome console gives more information than the firefox console

first,console
in google-chrome it seems more or less ok but in firefox when i first tried it it should give me not logged in my console

other---------------------------------------------------

beeing,cut,known,issue,print,css,better,versions
graph beeing cut in google-chrome is a known issue google-chrome does not respect some print css and works much better with firefox not all versions still

numbers,platforms,long,run
i ve been trying to sum up values over a swipe and see how different browsers report values and they vary a lot with safari reporting order of magnitude bigger numbers on almost all platforms google-chrome reporting quite more like 3 times more than firefox firefox being balanced on the long run but quite different among platforms on small movements on ubuntu gnome nearly only +3 or -3 seems like it sums up smaller events and then send a big +3


firefox is clearly less secured it deliberately allows something that google-chrome locks down

flexible,sense
google-chrome is more flexible in this sense than firefox which is why it works there

visible,subtle,distinguishable
it s clearly visible in firefox and is far more subtle yet also distinguishable in google-chrome

mean,point
or does this mean firefox is less secured on that point than google-chrome

earlier,freezing,glitch
if google-chrome seems to finish earlier than firefox then that is the freezing glitch in action

tolerant,image,headers
firefox is more tolerant when it comes to image headers then ie and google-chrome

frequent
this doesn t happen in google-chrome and is less frequent in firefox than in ie

smarter,careless
i guess google-chrome is smarter about me being careless than firefox is

time
in firefox it takes some more time compared to google-chrome safari

css3,linear-gradients,pleasant,alternative
i m trying to add a ribbon to a page using css3 linear-gradients but the rendering in google-chrome looks a lot less pleasant than its firefox or ie alternative

thing,reality,face
often google-chrome is understanding more thing then it should and firefox is bringing you the reality back in your face eheh

suspect,need,content,div,earlier
i suspect that this may be the case because ie and google-chrome need to know about the content of the div earlier than firefox

site,security,fussier,loads,errors,resources,non
i ve learned partly by trawling this site that the google-chrome security is fussier and the app loads correctly without errors in firefox and ie but i can t find any resources that are loaded from a non https source

longer
firefox takes almost 3 times longer than google-chrome

files
in google-chrome there is more files download 47 than in firefox ie 42

ellipsis,user,friendly
ellipsis still wraps in google-chrome but is more user friendly in firefox by adding the .

hand,edges,lines,directions,firebug,dev,tools
you can see if you look at the bottom and right hand edges of both google-chrome lines up perfectly but firefox seems further in both directions and i cannot work out why either in firebug or google-chrome dev tools

plugin,solution,low-level,http,stuff,better,anyone,idea
given these last two complications i am leaning towards a browser plugin as the solution probably firefox since low-level http stuff seems to be better supported than in google-chrome but i am wondering if anyone has an idea for a more cross-browser-y solution and or if there is something out there that might provide a good api for this kind of thing

responsive
but firefox keeps being less responsive than google-chrome or ie

characters
firefox encodes more characters than google-chrome

5x5,table,22px
update3 now it works here which means that i couldn t fully reproduce my bug to show it to you but in general the problem is that the height of 5x5 table in google-chrome is less from firefox on 22px which is 22px gap between table container and a table itself

hiccup,fix,picky,svg,attributes
i had a hiccup in firefox but found a fix after figuring out firefox is a bit more picky than google-chrome when defining svg attributes

looks,different,browsers,saturated,background-color,rgb
i have just noticed a site i am working on looks different in google-chrome than other browsers saf firefox everything is more saturated in google-chrome even a background-color rgb

facebook,someone,open,source,developers,math.min,modification,chromium,right,sense,b,similar,speed,faster,slower
when i posted this on facebook someone said that since firefox is open source project developers optimized math.min but google-chrome didn t since google-chrome is just a modification of chromium but beside that above statement is not quite right that makes no sense because that doesn t explain the reason why google-chrome s and firefox s math.min a b performs in similar speed and google-chrome s math.min a b and firefox s performs in same speed because if firefox is faster than google-chrome then google-chrome s math.min a b should be much slower than firefox s

local,description,datachannel,sdp,shorter,information
however a sdp object local description by firefox does not contain datachannel at all and moreover the sdp is much shorter than google-chrome and less information bundled

efficient
so why is google-chrome less efficient than firefox and ie

tests,strict,standards,cookie,manipulation
i think from my tests perhaps firefox has more strict standards than google-chrome about cookie manipulation

hardware,power,faster,edge,latest,verion
what we can see is that regardless of raw hardware power google-chrome seems to run up to three times faster than edge and also significantly faster than firefox all updated to the latest verion

testing,nicer,pops-up,unresponsive,alert,care
in my testing google-chrome is nicer it pops-up the unresponsive alert whereas firefox apparently doesn t care

close,specs,opt,initial,testing
btw google-chrome is less close to w3c specs than firefox de 42+ i d opt to start using firefox for your initial testing and then test it in ch to detect quirks

browser,best-guess,individual,chars,fatter,things
it works fine even for italics but i m aware that the user s browser is being asked to make a best-guess here and have noticed that google-chrome will make individual chars appear slightly fatter than firefox when i do things this way

document,flexibility
firefox may be sniffing the document s encoding with more flexibility than google-chrome is

space
firefox produces more space compared to google-chrome

noticeable
in firefox it s less noticeable but in google-chrome it s very noticeable

use,network,development,cross,origin,tool,detailed
use firefox network in development tools and check your requests sometimes it just sends options request in cross origin i insist on firefox because it s network tool is much more detailed than google-chrome and safari

sticking,debugging,angular,experience,better,typescript,files
i m sticking with firefox debugging of my angular 2 app outside of vs code as its user experience is better than google-chrome especially when working with typescript files so i ll stick with that for now unless i can figure this out

state,object,point,loop,end
firefox is more technically correct in this case as it outputs the state of the object at each point in the loop whereas google-chrome is apparently waiting until the end of the loop to output each console.log but i m not aware of a standards specification that covers the console host object

persnickety,defaults,printout
obviously google-chrome is more persnickety whereas firefox defaults to moving and sizing the printout as necessary

support,test,thisâ,little,noticeable
support exists in firefox and my test just confirmed thisâ but the handle is a little less noticeable than in google-chrome


firefox can get away with more than google-chrome before aborting

current,setup,narrower,minimum,min-width,600px,styles,layout.css
try your current setup in google-chrome google-chrome typically has a narrower minimum viewport width and try something like min-width 600px in firefox and your styles should be applied as expected layout.css will be applied when the viewport is at least 600px wide

range,object,richer
i inspected the range object in both google-chrome and firefox and then noticed that firefox s range object is far richer than google-chrome s

internet,explorer,conditions,higher,main,content
most noticeably if you look or google-chrome firefox and then internet explorer 9 you ll notice that the terms and conditions are slightly higher than in google-chrome or firefox and thus slightly touching the main content area

higher,severity,possible,cause
google-chrome is reporting the missing key with a higher severity than firefox is so i want to eliminate that as a possible cause

ie9,proper,domain,strict,localstorate,object,need
firefox and ie9 require a proper domain to run from presumably because they are more strict than google-chrome in the way they associate the localstorate object to a domain in google-chrome it doesn t need to be a domain as such

smaller, higher, larger, ---------------------------------------------------

passwords,smaller
google-chrome renders passwords smaller than firefox

shape,button,2px,taller,right
by highlighting the shape of the two elements you can see that in firefox left the button is 2px taller than in google-chrome right

line-through,style,lower,implementation,different
it seems that in firefox ie the line-through style is a bit lower than google-chrome i am not sure if this is because of the implementation of different browsers or something

fiddle,positioning,background,image,lower
open up the fiddle in both firefox google-chrome to see what i m talking about - in firefox the positioning of the background image is much lower than in google-chrome safari

longer,input,fields
google-chrome renders longer input fields than firefox and ie

font,smaller,ie
in google-chrome the font appears to be 1px smaller than firefox and ie and i cannot see why

text,smaller,right
why in firefox text smaller left than in google-chrome and opera right

benchmark,extensions,higher,performance
so i wonder the benchmark is also influenced by the installed extensions or google-chrome is really so much higher than firefox in performance

thumbnail,smaller
firefox thumbnail 4 times smaller than on google-chrome

default,font,larger
arabic default font in google-chrome is larger than it is in firefox

suffice,start,problems,larger,heights
suffice to say ie and google-chrome start having problems at larger heights than does firefox

permission,error,reproducible
this does not seem to occur in safari or ie and a similar permission error occurs sometimes in firefox but is reproducible more often than not in google-chrome

input,button,padding
in firefox the input button has more padding than in google-chrome

select,box,taller,element,container,blue
the reason this is happening is because firefox renders the select box as a taller element than google-chrome and the container of the blue text is getting caught on the select s container element because it s now sticking out lower than the others

higher,baseline
ie firefox higher than baseline google-chrome on baseline

inches,higher,displays
what firefox displays is about 5 inches higher than what google-chrome displays

default,textbox,padding
firefox s default textbox includes more padding than ie google-chrome

pc,fine,server,smaller
my question is similar the same page in my pc renders fine firefox google-chrome but the same one on a server rendered smaller by firefox google-chrome ok

memory,errors,heights,greater,higher
i ve ran into out of memory errors on firefox with canvas heights greater than 8000 google-chrome seems to handle much higher at least to 32000

width,document,smaller,example,screen,resolution,reports
while the rest of the browsers report the correct width of the document firefox reports a smaller one example at screen resolution of 1920x1080 ie google-chrome and safari reports 1920 while firefox reports 1903

ideas,spacing
any ideas why google-chrome is apply more spacing than firefox ie

work,setting,iframed,page,larger,part,text
safari and opera work with the google-chrome setting but firefox and ie display the iframed page larger than google-chrome causing part of the text to be cut off

browsers,background,whiter,brighter
in firefox and other browsers the background is much whiter and brighter than in google-chrome

font-size,smaller
if we remove the font-size it appears properly in google-chrome but shows up smaller in firefox

extensions,limited,hook
google-chrome extensions are considerably more limited than firefox extensions â â they can only hook the behavior of the browser in certain predefined ways

button,wider
in google-chrome the button is wider than in firefox

spacing,letter,larger
i am checking it in firefox and google-chrome and see that in google-chrome spacing between letter is larger than in firefox

position,higher,matter,padding
the position of the list in firefox is always higher than that of google-chrome no matter how i padding or margin the list

green,image,smaller,bigger,necessary,images,unchanged
if i remove this code the width of green image in firefox becomes smaller but it s still bigger than necessary about 100px the google-chrome images keeps unchanged

site,display,font-size,1px,bigger
i built a site and the problem is google-chrome display font-size 1px bigger than firefox

tools,browsers,#main_nav_bar,ul,wider
after looking into the issue with the inspection tools of both browsers it seems that firefox is making the #main_nav_bar ul 10px wider than google-chrome

issue,height
the issue that i encountered was that google-chrome was giving me height about 300px more than the firefox ie

footer,link,text,larger,margins,icons
this is because in ie and firefox the footer link text is larger than in google-chrome and safari therefore the margins that i ve set up for the icons do not work

menu,links,px,smaller
my menu links seem in google-chrome correctly but in firefox my menu links are 1 px smaller than google-chrome

linux,text,pixel,higher
on linux google-chrome displays text about one pixel higher than firefox and opera

left-collumn,bigger,height
but in firefox the left-collumn gets a much bigger height than in google-chrome

font-size,larger
i ve found that the font-size in firefox is a bit larger than in google-chrome

lower
in firefox it seems that this is 1px lower than in google-chrome and safari

green,div,bigger,different
in google-chrome the green div is bigger than in firefox i really don t know what is the problem i think in firefox it displays as it should but in google-chrome and ie9 it displays different

text,bigger,bolder
i have too problem with text in the firefox is bigger maybe bolder as in google-chrome .

fonts,thinner
even then google-chrome s fonts look thinner than in firefox or ie

tooltip,delay,higher
for my website i noticed that tooltip delay in firefox was much higher than in google-chrome

pixels,size,bigger
that happens because pixels size in google-chrome is bigger than in firefox

smaller,screenshot,break-point
it looks like google-chrome is smaller in your screenshot there so firefox could just not be at the defined break-point yet

width,columns,problems
firefox has like 40px less width than google-chrome in columns which is causing problems

inputs,attribute,wider
even if you give the inputs a attribute firefox renders them wider than google-chrome

header,request,bigger
here the working header request with firefox bigger than google-chrome request

button,tad,smaller
in google-chrome the button should be a tad smaller than in firefox

font-face,bold,bolder
font-face bold in firefox is bolder than in google-chrome

text,lower
firefox text is 1px lower than in google-chrome and ie

word,look,wider
the same word in firefox look wider than in google-chrome

browsers,instance,white
notably this doesn t happen in all browsers google-chrome renders more smoothly than ie and firefox for instance but is there any way i can make those white lines stop appearing when the user zooms in

height,bigger,input
why height in google-chrome is bigger than firefox of input

higher,original
in google-chrome it is appearing higher than the original in firefox

server,google,error
when i run my http web server on google google-chrome it gives more 324 error than in firefox

right,developers
thus i think firefox is perhaps more right but other developers at google-chrome think otherwise

fonts,issue,font,higher,size
i know different engines render fonts differently and but the issue i m having is that firefox renders the font higher than google-chrome - at the size i am displaying the font this is very noticeable 3 or 4 px - which on a button means they re totally misaligned

heads,firebug+firepath,handy,tool,developer
first just a heads up you may want to try firebug+firepath on firefox which is a more handy tool than google-chrome s developer tool

extensions,power,wider,access
firefox extensions have much more power than google-chrome and have wider access to browser s internal api

great,tool,useful,quicker,extensions
also google-chrome has a great tool that allows you to edit css on the fly which i find more useful and quicker than using firefox s extensions

top,cells,look,taller
currently with the 10px top padding the cells in google-chrome look taller than in firefox

issue,webdriver,higher,security,counterpart
found that the issue stemmed from using the firefox webdriver which apparently has much higher security than its google-chrome counterpart

programming,extensions,easier,similar
i found programming google-chrome extensions easier than firefox but i couldn t come across something similar to xpcom in google-chrome

higher
i just found out that if you re using google-chrome you trigger antialiasing at 49px or higher however with firefox it s set at 257px or higher

faster, slower, browser, ---------------------------------------------------

slower,laptop
why is firefox so much slower than google-chrome on my laptop

tldr,filter,faster,opposite
tldr in firefox filter is slightly faster in google-chrome that s the opposite

browser,default,longer
i want to set my own time limit rather than use the browser s default i believe google-chrome s is much longer than firefox s

use,dev,mode,slower
use firefox rather than google-chrome - google-chrome with dev mode is much slower than firefox

function,slower,machine
also google-chrome s map function is up to 2x slower than firefox on my machine

slower,usable
i ve tested the sample on firefox and it s a bit slower than google-chrome but usable

mac,os,game,faster,smoother
i m on a mac os x 10.8.2 running firefox 18.0.2 - it actually runs the game faster and smoother than my google-chrome 25.0.1364.99

thats,mean,faster,execution
however if thats the case does this mean firefox is faster in execution than google-chrome

slower
firefox is slower than google-chrome in javascript

condition,version
i need to do the same condition but for less than google-chrome version 46 and for less than firefox version 44

faster,wait,expected
maybe google-chrome is working faster than firefox try adding a wait with expected conditions

system,development,mode,slower,details
because of how google-chrome s plugin system works development mode in google-chrome is much slower than in firefox or safari see here for more details

browser,behavior,stricter
it is also proper browser behavior firefox is just stricter about it than google-chrome is

browser,slower
it depends on the browser its definitely true for ie and firefox but seems slower on google-chrome

dom,api,1000-fold,slower,worse,areas,instance,test,innerhtml,faster
google-chrome is lightning fast when you use the dom api but vastly slower using the .innerhtml operator by a magnitude 1000-fold slower however firefox is worse than google-chrome in some areas for instance the append test is much slower than google-chrome but the innerhtml test runs much faster than google-chrome

slower
firefox is even slower that google-chrome

.prototype,faster,difference,slower
in google-chrome it seems .prototype is faster firefox shows no difference between the two although generally performs slower than google-chrome

browser,implementation,faster,brackets,dots
it s just a matter of preferences and browser implementation eg firefox works faster with brackets while google-chrome works faster with the dots

load,faster
based on what you have provided i cannot tell if google-chrome actually does load faster than firefox

svg,performance,slower,webkit,ie10
svg performance in firefox is slower than in webkit google-chrome and ie10

good,slower
firefox - good a bit slower than google-chrome

abc_def,property,faster
the funny thing is that for abc_def property google-chrome is actually much faster than firefox and ie as i expected

slower,respectful,privacy
using firefox even it s slower than google-chrome it s still more respectful of privacy

renatoargh,test,faster
for example using renatoargh s test google-chrome is faster with option 2 firefox with option 1

performance,test,filling,faster,clearing
here is a simple performance test showing that in google-chrome filling is faster than clearing i am not sure what goes on with google-chrome and canvas nowadays but in firefox clearing is many times faster than filling both significantly faster than google-chrome

function,older,version
i would like this function to work in firefox ie google-chrome etc but at the moment it only works in google-chrome and older than firefox version 49

results,reproducible,faster,timeouts,dom
and of course the results - if they are reproducible - might suggest that google-chrome is faster than firefox or that firefox just prioritises timeouts over dom events

version,faster
but i guess google-chrome i have version 10 should be much faster than firefox 3.6

idea,loads,function,slower
do you have any idea why google-chrome loads javascript function much slower than firefox

ie8,faster
in ie8 and google-chrome it runs even faster than firefox in general and this slow down never happens

developer,mode,details
i usually use google-chrome s developer mode which imho already gives even more details than firefox

faster,drawimage
rendering without buffering on google-chrome is faster than firefox so i m actually not sure why google-chrome is having such a problem with drawimage

faster,imacros
i ve found that firefox is greatly faster with imacros than google-chrome

faster,huge,files
in my experience google-chrome will be a lot faster than firefox to debug huge js files

faster,bool
on google-chrome it s significantly faster to do this using 1 0 but on firefox it s slightly faster to do this using bool

particular,page,faster
the trouble is choosing a good value for x since for this particular page google-chrome is so very much faster than firefox which is faster than ie

parsers,performance,v37,slower,v30
i have been working with linear parsers lately and noticed the performance in google-chrome v37 was much slower than in firefox v30

slower,devmode,plugin
the reason google-chrome is slower than firefox is that the devmode plugin runs in a sandbox so calls and data have to cross the sandbox boundaries

faster,browser,spread,results,accurate,result
i am not concerned about the fact that firefox runs faster as browser js implementations will vary so much as the wide spread of results encountered in google-chrome that makes getting an accurate result impossible

faster,bit-wise
google-chrome is just faster than firefox which just faster than ie at bit-wise operations

faster,webdriver,dom
as you said google-chrome is faster than firefox so the webdriver is trying to interact with the dom before when elements are not yet visible exist

idea,frame,browser,correct
the idea is that if they are using ie then they must install google-chrome frame and if they are using less than firefox 4 or opera 11.5 then they must upgrade their browser not not sure if the way i am doing that is correct

browser,wrapping,worse,extra,space
though from a design perspective it may be easier to simply add the extra 5px to the width designing for the worst case browser to prevent wrapping in google-chrome which is worse than extra space in firefox ie

use,development,faster,icons
i use google-chrome for development as i find it runs faster than firefox and ie so it is a bore to guess where the icons are

typeof,slower,fastest
in google-chrome typeof is slower than the other two but in firefox it is the fastest

v8,faster,spidermonkey,things
as google-chrome s v8 is dramatically faster than firefox s spidermonkey at the moment these things are constantly in flux pick the forward loop as it s faster on the slower engine

results,browser,faster,webkit
the results varied from a browser to another firefox 4.0b12 is faster using but google-chrome webkit and opera is faster when using

faster,70x
this makes firefox 50x faster than google-chrome and 70x faster than safari is there any known reason for that

faster,sunspider,tests,loads,correct
right now google-chrome is faster than firefox sunspider tests so your statement it loads faster in firefox is not really correct

slower,sunspider,tests
as you can see ie 8 is about 5 times slower than firefox 3.6 and almost 20 times slower than google-chrome 9 at least when using sunspider tests

slow,path,array.filter,slower,run
google-chrome is extremely slow for your code path but grep seems to be 50 faster than array.filter here making it 900 slower than the firefox run

spidermonkey,slower,max,speed
spidermonkey firefox is slower 50 of google-chrome max speed but the speed is consistent

color,btw.,faster
now when clicking a time less than 1 millisecond will be displayed however it obviously takes nearly a second on my computer until the changed color actually is displayed where btw. google-chrome seems to be faster than firefox

gsap,performance,worse,repeats,css,animations
firefox gsap performance is still much worse than in google-chrome but google-chrome gsap does still lag every few repeats or so while in google-chrome the css animations do not

anyone,slower,3d,rendering
and also does anyone know why is firefox so much slower than google-chrome in 3d rendering

slowdown,worker,thread,slower,main
update just tried it on firefox 30 and it did not experience the same slowdown in a worker thread but it was slower than google-chrome when run in the main thread

faster
that means firefox is more than 7x faster than google-chrome here

slower,boats,highest
firefox is slower than google-chrome which boats one of the highest javascript engines a modified version of webkit

hardware,faster
also firefox 4 has hardware accelerated canvas that is marginally faster than ie9 and a lot faster than google-chrome

better, time, browser, ---------------------------------------------------

computer,better,tests,jsperf
on my computer firefox performs much better than google-chrome on these tests using jsperf

ps,situation,better,new,line
ps i ve noticed that in google-chrome situation is better than in firefox but new line still starts beneath tag

little,nicer,element
in firefox this might be handled a little nicer than google-chrome but rather than completely redraw an element you should try to append only what you need

apis,experimental,likely,better
the google-chrome apis are currently experimental hence these tools are likely to be better developed under firefox

html,collection,better,imo
google-chrome sends back and html collection that is longer really better imo than firefox ie or chromium

computer,statistics,better,normal-fast,best,slow
bad buffering can also be a result of a slow computer because statistics show that google-chrome is better for a normal-fast computer and firefox works best on slow computers

ie8,better,browser,possible
ie8 is the same and firefox is much better but i ve migrated away to google-chrome now so would like to stick with the one browser if possible

algorithm,better,text
and additionally the algorithm that google-chrome uses is better than the one in firefox at least for handling the resizing of text

better,support
is it because google-chrome has much better javascript support than firefox

better
also it does appear that firefox consistently handles this better than ie or google-chrome

better,settimeout,final
firefox works a bit better than google-chrome but the settimeout just seems to delay the final result being shown rather than delaying each step

knowledge,better,apologies
my knowledge of firefox is better than google-chrome so my apologies if i missed something

better,accuracy,lower,time
phantomjs achieves a better accuracy than firefox slightly lower than google-chrome but in around half the time of firefox

firebug,version,better
install firebug firefox version is better then a google-chrome one

easier,better,element,webpage
firefox is easier and better than google-chrome in finding the element from the webpage

better,use,slower,image,comparison
better use google-chrome even thought firefox is not slower than google-chrome for once probably the tracing for the image comparison pays off yay

debugger
what s up with google-chrome that the debugger behaves less conveniently than firefox

formatting,better
it seems google-chrome applies some formatting to render better than firefox

worse,load,time
my guess is google-chrome is caching more agressively and thats why you are seeing worse load time on firefox

browser,usage,android,line,pasting,better
if you are able to enforce browser usage i find that google-chrome on android preserves line breaks when copying and pasting much better than firefox

better
firefox handles this better than google-chrome does but neither exactly the way i want

better
google-chrome handles these better than compared to firefox

time,plugin,better
it s not the first time that the plugin for firefox works better for me than the one for google-chrome

better,black
in firefox it s much better than google-chrome but still not as black as ie

pd,note,developer,tools,better,complete
pd note that firefox s developer tools are better and more complete than google-chrome developer tools but in essence are for the same purpose

better
my firefox adds more chopping to video playing itself google-chrome plays the video much better

test,timer,better,hope
when i ran the test individually with a timer google-chrome actually performed better than firefox hope this helps

better
also ie and firefox seems to work better than google-chrome

test,combos,quicker
the most interesting thing i noted is that certain test combos in firefox are much quicker than even google-chrome

dev,tools,better
google-chrome dev tools are by far better than firefox ie whatever imho

transparency,issue,better
transparency is also an issue however google-chrome seems to handle all three better than firefox

better,benchmark
also why does firefox perform way better than google-chrome on this benchmark

new,tiles,maps.google.com,issue,better
in firefox the render of new tiles and the panning is laggy this is not the case when using maps.google.com so it s not an issue of google-chrome being better than firefox

better,performance
in my experience google-chrome has better javascript performance than firefox

device,dependent,objects,better,arrays
performance is browser and device dependent for example firefox handles objects better than arrays while google-chrome prefers arrays

time,add-on,api,restrictive
no and there won t be any time soon because google-chrome s add-on api is more restrictive than firefox

nexus,better,display,sluggish
firefox on nexus 7 is a bit better at producing reasonable sample rate readings but the updating of the display is even more sluggish than google-chrome

animations,chromium,better,general,browsing
also for animations google-chrome chromium behaves much better that is why i use it for development but do my general browsing in firefox

iframes,better,span,font
they use iframes in firefox which seems better but in google-chrome they do this by putting manually defined span and font tags

better,firebug
google-chrome shows it better than firefox firebug

alternative,ajax,add-on,easier,web,browser
another alternative for javascript ajax is writing a google-chrome add-on easier than firefox or embeding a web browser within your application

performance
the performance in google-chrome is best less so in firefox and ie

late,better,performance
of late firefox has had much better performance than google-chrome

better,browser,developers,cause,tools
although firefox is a better browser for developers than google-chrome cause it gives you more tools to work with

bigger,time,difference,gap,animation
google-chrome has a bigger time difference yet firefox is the one with the gap in the animation

logs,browser,laugh,better,google,apps
the logs only seem to work with a google-chrome browser which is a laugh as usually firefox is better at running google apps than google-chrome

better,crash,issue
i have tried firefox and it better than google-chrome crash issue is not always happen but not solved this issue

debugger,firebug,better
evidently firefox debugger firebug is better than google-chrome debugger

better,regard
so firefox is better than google-chrome - but both suck in that regard

sporadic,time,lesser,extent
this is sporadic and i see it happening most of the time with firefox 4.0.1 and 5.0 and to a lesser extent with google-chrome

easier, easy, apk, ---------------------------------------------------

easy,apk,command,easier
with firefox it was very easy i just grabbed the apk from their ftp server run the adb install command one would think it should be even easier with google-chrome but it s really not

easier,days
firefox is probably easier than google-chrome these days

webextensions,easier,instead.
i have been trying to do this in firefox webextensions but if it s easier with google-chrome i will try it that way instead.

strict, lax, restriction, ---------------------------------------------------

lax,security,restriction,strict,mixed-content
it works in firefox because firefox is more lax about this security restriction and google-chrome happens to be more strict on mixed-content errors

restrictions,files,strict,middle
apple s safari applies almost no cross domain restrictions to files opened locally but firefox is much more strict about what it permits with google-chrome somewhere in the middle

strict,things,commas
google-chrome s parsing may be more strict than firefox is at having things like trailing commas as specified by the standard at as stated in danilo celic s answer

data, stricter, seconds, ---------------------------------------------------

data,seconds
using the same data google-chrome does in less than 5 seconds what took ie and firefox 10 to 15 seconds to accomplish

stricter,data,local
google-chrome is stricter than firefox when it comes to loading data from your local filesystem

correct,stricter,base,uri
i d say that firefox is correct in being stricter than google-chrome here even though i m not entirely sure the base uri has changed and this new uri should be used for the relative uri #symboltype1 too

console, first, information, ---------------------------------------------------

first,console
in google-chrome it seems more or less ok but in firefox when i first tried it it should give me not logged in my console

console,information
the google-chrome console gives more information than the firefox console

characters, illegal, picky, ---------------------------------------------------

lenient,illegal,characters,url
maybe google-chrome is more lenient when it comes to illegal characters in the url than firefox or something like that

picky,characters,uris
firefox is more picky about characters that are set in uris than google-chrome

forgiving, work, extension, ---------------------------------------------------

advanced,plugin,extension,work
firefox has a more advanced plugin than the google-chrome extension but both work

forgiving
i guess google-chrome is a bit more forgiving than firefox

work,forgiving,errors
actually your code doesn t work on firefox because he is less forgiving than google-chrome about errors

extension,reliable,addict
2 install the firefox extension there s also one for google-chrome but the firefox one is more reliable -- so if you re a google-chrome addict like i am then use both

forgiving,mistakes
google-chrome is just more forgiving for some mistakes then firefox

resources,threads,possible,work
also about firefox i know still less than google-chrome and i m not sure about how it innerly manage resources among threads and if it is even possible to achieve what i want but if possible i d need to do the same work with firefox threads

forgiving,compliant
google-chrome is more forgiving or you could call it less compliant firefox less so

forgiving,irregular,syntax
i m taking a quite educated guess here that firefox is more forgiving with the irregular syntax than google-chrome

finnicky
in general i have found google-chrome to be more finnicky than firefox

html,page,forgiving
most likely your post value has one or more characters in it that are breaking the html of the page and ie firefox are being a bit more forgiving than google-chrome is

standards-compliant
firefox which is more standards-compliant than google-chrome doesn t allow this

stable,versions,permissions,older,work
on stable versions of google-chrome the permissions show allow and it still won t connect even with firefox works older versions of google-chrome work

lenient
in my experience firefox is sometimes more lenient than google-chrome but i would definitely test in both

simple,extension,business,longer
this is due to the simple fact that firefox has been in the extension business longer than google-chrome or ie

error,multiple,jquerys,older,newer,version
i believe the error might be how firefox and google-chrome handles these multiple times included jquerys and it might be that google-chrome uses the older and firefox newer version

detailed,information,ajax,errors
google-chrome provides more detailed information about the ajax errors even when firefox doesn t say anything

pickier, more-so, ---------------------------------------------------

pickier
apparently google-chrome is pickier than firefox

more-so
it looks like it shows for firefox more-so than google-chrome but it might help

ram, memory, ---------------------------------------------------

ram
we use google-chrome though which i believe uses more ram than firefox

memory
firefox allocates lots of memory during that preloading up to 20-30 times more than google-chrome or safari do and even twice as much as ie

similar, issue, windows, ---------------------------------------------------

issue,windows,framerate,lower,mac,similar,framerates
i m seeing a strange issue on windows in google-chrome the framerate is almost 2 times lower than in firefox on mac google-chrome and firefox have similar framerates

similar,older,issue,url,scrolling,execution
i have encounter a problem with google-chrome that is similar to an older issue with firefox at this url scrolling blocks javascript execution in firefox

strict, ---------------------------------------------------

strict
google-chrome is a bit more strict than firefox here

strict
is this due to firefox being more strict than google-chrome

slower, duration, 1s, ---------------------------------------------------

element,quicker,duration,1s,animation,2s,slower
firefox seems to animate the element quicker than google-chrome does and so while a duration of 1s is enough for the animation in google-chrome firefox needs it to be 2s to be slower and show the effect

trickier,bug,situation,slower,amount,buffer
this is trickier to work around and you should file a google-chrome bug describing the situation and where it s slower than firefox but you could potentially reduce the amount of buffer uploads by looking into instancing or using uniform arrays instead of updating vertexes for positions textures

other---------------------------------------------------

local,description,datachannel,sdp,shorter,information
however a sdp object local description by firefox does not contain datachannel at all and moreover the sdp is much shorter than google-chrome and less information bundled

mean,point
or does this mean firefox is less secured on that point than google-chrome

state,object,point,loop,end
firefox is more technically correct in this case as it outputs the state of the object at each point in the loop whereas google-chrome is apparently waiting until the end of the loop to output each console.log but i m not aware of a standards specification that covers the console host object

close,specs,opt,initial,testing
btw google-chrome is less close to w3c specs than firefox de 42+ i d opt to start using firefox for your initial testing and then test it in ch to detect quirks

facebook,someone,open,source,developers,math.min,modification,chromium,right,sense,b,similar,speed,faster,slower
when i posted this on facebook someone said that since firefox is open source project developers optimized math.min but google-chrome didn t since google-chrome is just a modification of chromium but beside that above statement is not quite right that makes no sense because that doesn t explain the reason why google-chrome s and firefox s math.min a b performs in similar speed and google-chrome s math.min a b and firefox s performs in same speed because if firefox is faster than google-chrome then google-chrome s math.min a b should be much slower than firefox s

5x5,table,22px
update3 now it works here which means that i couldn t fully reproduce my bug to show it to you but in general the problem is that the height of 5x5 table in google-chrome is less from firefox on 22px which is 22px gap between table container and a table itself

looks,different,browsers,saturated,background-color,rgb
i have just noticed a site i am working on looks different in google-chrome than other browsers saf firefox everything is more saturated in google-chrome even a background-color rgb

hiccup,fix,picky,svg,attributes
i had a hiccup in firefox but found a fix after figuring out firefox is a bit more picky than google-chrome when defining svg attributes

beeing,cut,known,issue,print,css,better,versions
graph beeing cut in google-chrome is a known issue google-chrome does not respect some print css and works much better with firefox not all versions still

internet,explorer,conditions,higher,main,content
most noticeably if you look or google-chrome firefox and then internet explorer 9 you ll notice that the terms and conditions are slightly higher than in google-chrome or firefox and thus slightly touching the main content area

range,object,richer
i inspected the range object in both google-chrome and firefox and then noticed that firefox s range object is far richer than google-chrome s

persnickety,defaults,printout
obviously google-chrome is more persnickety whereas firefox defaults to moving and sizing the printout as necessary

sticking,debugging,angular,experience,better,typescript,files
i m sticking with firefox debugging of my angular 2 app outside of vs code as its user experience is better than google-chrome especially when working with typescript files so i ll stick with that for now unless i can figure this out

thing,reality,face
often google-chrome is understanding more thing then it should and firefox is bringing you the reality back in your face eheh

document,flexibility
firefox may be sniffing the document s encoding with more flexibility than google-chrome is

support,test,thisâ,little,noticeable
support exists in firefox and my test just confirmed thisâ but the handle is a little less noticeable than in google-chrome

higher,severity,possible,cause
google-chrome is reporting the missing key with a higher severity than firefox is so i want to eliminate that as a possible cause

current,setup,narrower,minimum,min-width,600px,styles,layout.css
try your current setup in google-chrome google-chrome typically has a narrower minimum viewport width and try something like min-width 600px in firefox and your styles should be applied as expected layout.css will be applied when the viewport is at least 600px wide

flexible,sense
google-chrome is more flexible in this sense than firefox which is why it works there

ie9,proper,domain,strict,localstorate,object,need
firefox and ie9 require a proper domain to run from presumably because they are more strict than google-chrome in the way they associate the localstorate object to a domain in google-chrome it doesn t need to be a domain as such

use,network,development,cross,origin,tool,detailed
use firefox network in development tools and check your requests sometimes it just sends options request in cross origin i insist on firefox because it s network tool is much more detailed than google-chrome and safari

files
in google-chrome there is more files download 47 than in firefox ie 42

noticeable
in firefox it s less noticeable but in google-chrome it s very noticeable

tests,strict,standards,cookie,manipulation
i think from my tests perhaps firefox has more strict standards than google-chrome about cookie manipulation

numbers,platforms,long,run
i ve been trying to sum up values over a swipe and see how different browsers report values and they vary a lot with safari reporting order of magnitude bigger numbers on almost all platforms google-chrome reporting quite more like 3 times more than firefox firefox being balanced on the long run but quite different among platforms on small movements on ubuntu gnome nearly only +3 or -3 seems like it sums up smaller events and then send a big +3

browser,best-guess,individual,chars,fatter,things
it works fine even for italics but i m aware that the user s browser is being asked to make a best-guess here and have noticed that google-chrome will make individual chars appear slightly fatter than firefox when i do things this way

responsive
but firefox keeps being less responsive than google-chrome or ie

frequent
this doesn t happen in google-chrome and is less frequent in firefox than in ie

visible,subtle,distinguishable
it s clearly visible in firefox and is far more subtle yet also distinguishable in google-chrome

space
firefox produces more space compared to google-chrome


firefox can get away with more than google-chrome before aborting

css3,linear-gradients,pleasant,alternative
i m trying to add a ribbon to a page using css3 linear-gradients but the rendering in google-chrome looks a lot less pleasant than its firefox or ie alternative

hardware,power,faster,edge,latest,verion
what we can see is that regardless of raw hardware power google-chrome seems to run up to three times faster than edge and also significantly faster than firefox all updated to the latest verion

efficient
so why is google-chrome less efficient than firefox and ie

hand,edges,lines,directions,firebug,dev,tools
you can see if you look at the bottom and right hand edges of both google-chrome lines up perfectly but firefox seems further in both directions and i cannot work out why either in firebug or google-chrome dev tools

ellipsis,user,friendly
ellipsis still wraps in google-chrome but is more user friendly in firefox by adding the .

longer
firefox takes almost 3 times longer than google-chrome

characters
firefox encodes more characters than google-chrome

earlier,freezing,glitch
if google-chrome seems to finish earlier than firefox then that is the freezing glitch in action


firefox is clearly less secured it deliberately allows something that google-chrome locks down

time
in firefox it takes some more time compared to google-chrome safari

smarter,careless
i guess google-chrome is smarter about me being careless than firefox is

plugin,solution,low-level,http,stuff,better,anyone,idea
given these last two complications i am leaning towards a browser plugin as the solution probably firefox since low-level http stuff seems to be better supported than in google-chrome but i am wondering if anyone has an idea for a more cross-browser-y solution and or if there is something out there that might provide a good api for this kind of thing

suspect,need,content,div,earlier
i suspect that this may be the case because ie and google-chrome need to know about the content of the div earlier than firefox

testing,nicer,pops-up,unresponsive,alert,care
in my testing google-chrome is nicer it pops-up the unresponsive alert whereas firefox apparently doesn t care

tolerant,image,headers
firefox is more tolerant when it comes to image headers then ie and google-chrome

site,security,fussier,loads,errors,resources,non
i ve learned partly by trawling this site that the google-chrome security is fussier and the app loads correctly without errors in firefox and ie but i can t find any resources that are loaded from a non https source
