fixed-point, arithmetic, slower, ---------------------------------------------------

faster,fixed-point,arithmetic
but another added benefit of this approach is that it could make your program run faster since fixed-point integer arithmetic is much faster than floating-point arithmetic

slower,arithmetic
historically floating-point could be much slower than integer arithmetic

slower
floating-point may be somewhat slower than integer but it s generally

math,faster
generally integer math is faster than floating-point math

slower
historically floating-point could be much slower than integer

arithmetics,complicated
floating-point arithmetics is by far more complicated than integer arithmetics

math,faster,function,major
integer math is often much faster than floating-point so such a function could be a major performance win

rule,thumb,2x,slower
as a rule of thumb floating-point is about 2x slower than integer on

arithmetic,simpler
but integer arithmetic arguably is inherently simpler than floating-point

division,faster,cpu
floating-point division is typically faster than integer division on the cpu

space,math,slower
they take up more space and floating-point math is slower than integer math

context,faster,slower
depending on context floating-point code may be as fast as or faster than integer code or it may be four times slower

today, units, unit, ---------------------------------------------------

today,units,faster,unit
today s floating-point units are pretty fast and may actually divide faster than an integer unit

divide,faster,fewer,bits,cpu,unit
floating-point divide is faster than integer fewer bits to divide assuming your cpu has floating-point unit

combinations,32b,faster,cpu,gpu
there are lots of cpu gpu combinations where a 32b integer multiply is faster than a 32b floating-point multiply on cpu and vice-versa on gpu

other---------------------------------------------------

general,real,larger,maximum,integers,representable
floating-point solves the more general problem of representing some real numbers that aren t integers and some real numbers that are larger than the maximum integer up to which all integers are representable here 16777216 all with a nearly uniform relative accuracy at least 1 2 precision

value,thanks,part
since the floating-point value is slightly less than the integer you rounded to thanks to .nextdown the integer part is going to be one less than that integer

possible,pong,arithmetic,likely,faster,difference,unlikely
it s even possible that you could implement pong using only integer arithmetic which is likely to be faster than floating-point -- but the difference is unlikely to be critical

scipy.ndimage,domain,better,results,image,processing
i did this very successfully with scipy.ndimage in the floating-point domain way better results than integer image processing like this

largest,smallest,greater,lower,digit,limitation,variable
i know c++ have functions that return largest or smallest integer that is greater or lower than a like ceil or floor.is there a function that implement digit limitation of floating-point variable

cell,phones,slower,order,magnitude,better,hardware,available
on somewhat limited processors like those in high-end cell phones floating-point may be somewhat slower than integer but it s generally within an order of magnitude or better so long as there is hardware floating-point available

arithmetic,faster,equivalent,likely,type
which uses all integer arithmetic is usually faster than its floating-point equivalent likely significantly faster in the case of a floating-point type equivalent to t-sql s decimal type

value,higher,rank,float
because the floating-point value is of a higher rank than an integer it will promote the integer to a float

division,coarser
you re performing integer division which is coarser than floating-point division

representation,memory,third,link,variables,ones
floating-point representation in memory can t add third link - because floating-point variables is much more strange than integer ones

types,larger,range
floating-point types have a larger range than the integer types so

individual,division,instruction,longer
an individual floating-point division instruction will take longer than an integer one

unpredictable,precision,issues,little,exact
however due to unpredictable floating-point precision issues it is sometimes little less than exact integer and in this case it is rounded down too much

nsdecimalnumber,types,able,bigger,numbers,precision
nsdecimalnumber and the floating-point types may be able to store bigger numbers than the integer types though with decreasing precision
