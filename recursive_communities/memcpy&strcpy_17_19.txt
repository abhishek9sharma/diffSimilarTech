slower, strncpy, faster, ---------------------------------------------------

slower,strncpy,faster
memcpy is rarely slower than strcpy or strncpy and often significantly faster

platform,faster,number,bytes
on almost any platform memcpy is going to be faster than strcpy when copying the same number of bytes

strlen,malloc,faster
because of the above replace strdup with strlen malloc memcpy memcpy is slightly faster than strcpy

faster,real,platforms
is memcpy usually faster than strcpy on most real platforms

notice,faster,source,string
notice that memcpy is faster than strcpy unless the source string is much smaller than the buffer s size which is rarely the case with ip addesses.

faster,blocks,memory
but sometimes memcpy performs faster than strcpy because it moves blocks of memory at a time which allows it to perform some optimization i will not go into details here

variable,string,faster,check
we keep track of what cmd s length ought to be in a variable and copy the string with memcpy which is slightly faster than strcpy and does neither check string length nor copy the extra zero at end of string

faster,longer,strings
memcpy is usually faster than strcpy for longer strings

information,use,faster
information - use memcpy as it s faster than strcpy and we know

x86,faster
so i feel that on x86 memcpy is faster than strcpy

faster,buffer,size
memcpy is faster than strcpy and also enforces you to specify a buffer size

performance, difference, efficient, ---------------------------------------------------

performance,difference,efficient,data,copies
performance difference memcpy is usually more efficient than strcpy which must scan the data it copies

memset,difference,data,byte,copies,string,time
memset behaves like strcpy but the difference is that memcpy copied the data as it is byte but strcpy copies the formatted string as well so takes more time than memcpy to execute

other---------------------------------------------------

non-naive,implementation,faster,profit,cpu
if size is known normally a non-naive implementation of memcpy is faster than strcpy since it takes profit of the cpu s data bus size

slower
memcpy is not really any slower than strcpy

constant,strings,string,complicated,beneficial,inline
the reason for not having strcpy i m guessing is that strcpy can be replaced more efficiently with memcpy for constant strings and if the string is not constant strcpy is a bit more complicated than memcpy anyway so not as beneficial to make inline optimisations for

efficient,rep,movs
memcpy can be more efficient than strcpy since rep movs is highly optimized on intel cpus esp

macro,memset,safer
your macro with memset and memcpy was not any safer than strcpy

amounts,data,large,slower
for example for small amounts of data an memcpy optimised for large amounts of data may be significantly slower than a strcpy that wasn t optimised for large amounts of data
