extra, work, better, ---------------------------------------------------

extra,work,faster,memset
this is an enormous amount of extra work and explains why calloc is faster than malloc and memset

better,zero-initialization,faster
it would be better to use malloc over calloc unless we want the zero-initialization because malloc is faster than calloc

faster,memory,zeros
malloc is faster since calloc initializes the allocated memory to contain all zeros

faster,memset
this means calloc can potentially be faster than calling malloc followed by memset since it can skip the memset if it knows it will already by zeroed

end,memory,faster,memset,difference
if end up using the memory anyway calloc is still faster than malloc and memset but the difference is not quite so ridiculous

speed,likely,faster,memset,memory
in terms of speed calloc is likely to be faster than malloc + memset if memory needs to be zeroed out

faster,memset,mmap,pages
calloc is faster than malloc + memset because calloc knows that the mmap d pages are pre-zeroed and memset forces the allocation of physical ram

faster,combination,memset,hand
and is as far as i know faster than the combination of malloc and memset on the other hand malloc alone is faster than calloc

slower,initialization,memory
i remember somewhere i have read that calloc is slower than malloc because calloc performs initialization to zero after performing memory allocation

slower,system,memory
also calloc is slower than malloc from operating system memory allocation perspective

other---------------------------------------------------

conceivable,address,memory,zeros,faster,memset,combo
it s conceivable that calloc could return address of memory location that is already pre-initialized with zeros thus it may be faster than malloc + memset combo

g_new0,arguments
g_new and g_new0 both take the same arguments unlike malloc that takes less arguments than calloc

array,null,correct
edit i m not a java expert but i think that in java members of new array are initialized to 0 or null so calloc is more correct than malloc in my code

slower,time,contents
calloc itself is slower than malloc because you have to spend some time to clear the contents of allocated memory

longer,memory
calloc does take longer than malloc because it has to zero out all the memory you asked for before giving it to you

faster,single,dimensional,pointer,format,double
malloc is faster than calloc reason is that malloc processed single dimensional array to pointer format whereas calloc takes double dimensional array and before processed it converts to single dimensional array then to pointer format

memset,closer
actually calling memset after malloc is closer to calling calloc than the option you suggest

better,hard,sensible
as written malloc would be better than calloc but the question used calloc and it would not be hard to make it sensible for use with this code too for example a conditional assignment in set_matrix such as

answers,larger,blocks
those answers was that calloc can allocate larger blocks than malloc can and etc

page.,post,better,+,memset
it takes a page off of the free_page_list updates mem_map zeroes the page and returns the physical address of the page. here s another post that explains it well and also explains why using calloc is better than malloc + memset

arguments,type,bigger,blocks,able,argument
for this reason since calloc uses two arguments of type size_t it can allocate bigger blocks than malloc will ever be able to since malloc takes only one argument of type size_t

common
malloc is far more common in c code than calloc
