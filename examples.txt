postgresql specifically has gotten easier to manage while mysql has lost some of the simplicity that gave it an advantage without picking up enough features that really matter
i know postgresql could be considered more mature than mysql with regards to locking thanks to mvcc - can i use row-locking or some other feature in postgresql instead of the token field
some recent tests we did showed that postgresql does perform faster than mysql and we believe the table partitioning feature in postgresql will be very important with a table in our database we foresee to grow into 100 million rows and more in production
i suggest postgresql it s more capable has more features and better support for complex queries and datatypes than mysql and has a lot of tuning options
while mysql has a larger user base postgresql is gaining more an more popularity ever since implementing several crucial features that were missing in earlier versions
some people were saying that postgresql is better for security purposes whereas mysql is becoming more feature rich.
mysql is more widely supported and a little easier to use but postgresql has some very cool features and functionality that s worth taking a gander at
mysql s version is apparently marginally faster than postgresql but lacks some of the more advanced spatial features therefore it s pretty much limited to finding records that match a certain range of coordinates
i suggest postgresql it s more capable has more features and better support for complex queries and datatypes than mysql and has a lot of tuning options
while mysql has a larger user base postgresql is gaining more an more popularity ever since implementing several crucial features that were missing in earlier versions
it s a shame postgresql isn t more popular than mysql since it supports exactly this feature out-of-the-box you d only have to share one sequence object between tables.
however postgresql s sql features are far more advanced than mysql s and mysql has a tendency to silently ignore things you tell it to do - especially in a default installation and if you rely on a foreign key to be created that might be a very unpleasant surprise
postgresql supports some more security features than mysql for example integration with gssapi or kerberos for logins last i checked mysql didn t have these

actually we could say that tcp is a higher level protocol compared to udp because tcp includes some advanced features which might be useful .
with tcp its slightly slower than udp and has more features
udp is simpler protocol than tcp and you can still simulate features of tcp using udp
what is that key feature in tcp that makes it have much much higher throughput than udp

innodb is a safer acid compliant engine with some integrity features that myisam lacks
myisam is better than innodb when you don t need those advanced features and storage speed is more important than other concerns
innodb is slower for read only databases because it has features acid compliant row level locking that myisam leaves out
i am creating an commerce website and i am stuck in a database problem i am storing customer orders please tell me which is better myisam or innodb i have to use transaction like feature in customer order table and i personally prefer myisam because it is much faster than innodb and it also supports full-text searching is there any way to use transaction like rollback feature in myisam so that if anything goes wrong table will be rollback to its previous state how to do that without any external library or any other server side access and i have to use mysql
as you are no doubt aware from your searches innodb is primarily better than myisam for high volume inserts not counting non-comparable features like foreign keys or full text searches which are exclusive to innodb and myisam respectively while myisam is primarily useful for tables which are read more often than they are written to
newer versions of mysql 5.5+ have extended innodb to support all the features that were previously only available on myisam such as fulltext and geospatial indexing and innodb performance is usually considerably better than myisam when configured properly

yes vhdl was once much more feature-rich than verilog but later revisions of the language verilog 2001 verilog 2005 systemverilog etc.. have cherry-picked most of the interesting features and there is far more robust toolchain support for verilog and its variant these days in addition to it being the dominant language in use in the us in my experience vhdl is only used here when dealing with extreme legacy blocks and in academic contexts partially due to the tools support mentioned previously
the other distributed tools are a lot faster svn is slow as hell even cvs can be faster sometimes have much more useful features than svn are developing rapidly while seeing any new feature in svn takes years
